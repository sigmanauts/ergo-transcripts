1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Everyone, my name is Bruno and I'm going
to present Beene, a proof of funding

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
platform.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The goal of this platform is very simple.
It's to enable projects that want to raise

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
funds to do so and to allow contributors
who are providing funds to those projects

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
to be rewarded with tokens.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
These tokens, we call them contribution
accounting tokens or proof of funding

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
tokens.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So what are the rules of this protocol of
this platform?

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So it works like this. Project owners
deploy a funds vault with the following

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
parameters: The funding token that should
be provided as funds into the project. A

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
minimum amount of funding tokens that need
to be raised for the fundraising to be

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
considered successful and for the project
to start.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
A deadline, the proof of funding token
that will be used to reward the

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
contributors, and the rate of proof of
funding tokens that will be given to the

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
contributors per funding token provided.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So after this funding vault is deployed,
project owners may add or remove proof of

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
funding tokens from the vault at any time.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
For as long as there are proof of funding
tokens available in the contract,

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
contributors can provide any amount of
funding tokens to the contract and they

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
immediately receive a proportional amount
of proof of funding tokens to account for

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
their contribution and serve as proof of
funding.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
At any time after the minimum amount has
been reached, project owners may withdraw

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
any amount of funding tokens from the
vault.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And at any time after the deadline, if
the minimum amount has not been reached,

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
contributors may return any amount of
proof of funding tokens to the vault and

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
withdraw the corresponding amount of
funding tokens that they had provided to

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
the vault before.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
These rules can also be displayed in this
more graphical form.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So in this chart, we have the time in the
horizontal axis and the amount raised in

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
the vertical axis. And as you can see, at
any time, if you have raised more than a

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
minimum amount, those are the actions that
project owners may perform and that

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
contributors may perform.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And if the amount raised has not reached
the minimum and the time has passed beyond

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
the deadline, then contributors may give
back their proof of funding tokens and

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
withdraw the funding tokens that they had
provided.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay, so let's have a look at some
examples.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So this is an actual example that we had
and that we used Ergo Raffle for this. But

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
with Ergo Raffle, then we had to manually
distribute the proof of funding tokens,

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
the contribution accounting tokens
afterwards. And with this platform that we

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
have built, this distribution will be done
automatically.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So this Stable Order needed 5000 ERG to
develop an SDK for Gluon Gold. And with

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:08,000
this funding platform, a vault with 5000
Gluon is created with a rate of one Gluon

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:17,000
per ERG and a deadline in two weeks. And
yeah, 5000 Gluon are added to the vault.

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Then let's suppose that after 1.5 weeks,
the goal of raising 5,000 ERG is achieved.

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The contributors will have received their
Gluon as soon as they have contributed and

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
this Stable Order will be able to withdraw
5,000 ERG immediately after the goal has

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
been achieved.

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Here's another example. Let's suppose
that a group of Ergo community members

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
wishes to produce from five to 20 articles
about Ergo at a cost of 100 ERG per

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
article. They create a new token, let's
say EAT, Ergo Articles Token, and they

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
create a vault with 2000 of those tokens
and a rate of one EAT per ERG.

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The minimum amount is set to 500 ERG and
the deadline is set to two weeks from now.

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So then let's suppose that after one week
the minimum goal of raising 500 ERG is

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
achieved. So at that point the group can
already withdraw the 500 ERG and start

55
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
producing the minimum number of articles,
like five articles.

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Then as time passes and the community
sees that the group is delivering the

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
articles, more contributors may provide
more ERG and be rewarded with the

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
remaining EAT that are there in the vault,
up to 2000 EAT.

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Now, if this initiative happens to be
working really well, the group may decide

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
to increase the number of EAT in the
contract to 10,000 and to allow the

61
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
community to continue contributing to the
production of up to 100 articles in total

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
now.

63
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Now let's have a look at another example.

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So let's suppose that the dev team
promises to use the latest technologies to

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
do something extremely amazing and they're
asking for five million ERG with a

66
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
deadline in two weeks and those who
contribute will be rewarded with a proof

67
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
of funding token that is now called Super
Duper Blockchain Tokens at a very

68
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
preferential rate.

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So it's a very great bargain and nobody
should miss out.

70
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And let's suppose that after one week,
things are looking really good, right? And

71
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
the team manages to raise 3 million ERG.
But then their too good to be true

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
promises get exposed as just a huge soup
of buzzwords and the community stops

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
funding.

74
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So after the deadline, those who had been
lured into providing funding for this scam

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
can safely give back their SDBT to get
their ERG back.

76
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So, with these very simple set of rules,
we can cover a wide variety of use cases,

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
such as, for example, donations. These
proof of funding tokens, they can serve as

78
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
proof of donation tokens, right? Something
that doesn't have like a monetary value,

79
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
but they are still valuable as a proof
that you have made something good, right?

80
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That you have donated to a certain cause,
to a certain project.

81
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
They can also be used for crowdfunding.
So in this case, the contribution

82
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
accounting tokens or the proof of funding
tokens could later be exchanged for goods

83
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
produced by the crowdfunded project.

84
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This platform can even be used for
traditional startup funding, you know,

85
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
traditional sale of tokens for a fixed
price. It could be used, for example, for

86
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
sales of event tickets, where the tokens
represent tickets to an event with a

87
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
minimum and a maximum capacity.

88
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And the original use case that made us
develop this platform is this use case of

89
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
benefactions that we have in Stable Order.
This idea that we are working together and

90
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
contributing to our projects and these
contributions may be both in the form of

91
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
labor and capital and both of these types
of contributions are treated equally and

92
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
they both receive tokens to account for
their contributions.

93
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So yeah, I hope you enjoyed the platform
and I hope everyone will have lots of

94
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
success raising funds for interesting
projects. And yeah, thank you. Please get

95
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
in touch and contribute to our projects.

96
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
These are our social media links. Follow
us, join us in our channels. Yeah, thank

97
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
you.

98
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hey, it's Jossemii. I'm going to show a
demo of the Beene Foundation platform.

99
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So this is the available projects list.
All of these projects can be funded by any

100
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:14,000
user. Contributions page is the project
where the user has contributed, my

101
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:25,000
projects is a list with all the projects
that the user owns and there is a

102
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:36,000
formulary to submit a new project.

103
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So the idea is to select a token, but
actually for the demo we are going to mint

104
00:10:49,000 --> 00:11:02,000
a new token. So, for example, set the
token amount to 1,000, 1 ERG per token,

105
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:15,000
this will be max 10 ERG token and a
minimum of 1 ERG token and let's say 9

106
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:28,000
days until the user funding deadline.

107
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You might, for example, add this project
link. So this is the content of the

108
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,000
project. And this is a description,
description, description.

109
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So this will execute a transaction and
we'll mint these tokens so then we can see

110
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:08,000
the transaction was submitted and we need
to wait but now I'm going to contribute to

111
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:17,000
another project so for example to this
project.

112
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:30,000
In the detail page we can see all the
info of the project how much time left -

113
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:41,000
the time left is in block number of blocks
but it's translated to time - and this is

114
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:52,000
a progress bar of the current amount of
tokens, the maximum amount of tokens and

115
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:03,000
the minimum amount of tokens to make the
refund if it's not reached.

116
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So let's contribute. Well currently I'm
the owner with this wallet so this is

117
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:24,000
another page with the other browser with
other wallet and if I - yes, I only see

118
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:34,000
the user actions.

119
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So I can contribute. I can't refund
because the deadline is not reached yet.

120
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So I will contribute with one token, for
example. Eight tokens was sold for now. So

121
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I will submit it. That's the transaction
ID.

122
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And that's it. So, well, that's it. This
is the demo.
