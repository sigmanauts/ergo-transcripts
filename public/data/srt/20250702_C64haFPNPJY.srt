1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hey everybody, Timur here coming to you
solo today.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I am making a quick video for you to
contribute to this Ergo Summit so that

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
you're going to see a collection of videos
that are focusing on some of the prominent

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
applications on Ergo and I get the honor
of presenting to you what I think is one

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
of our cornerstone applications.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is something that not only is
functional, but it really exemplifies what

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I think Ergo is all about.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's totally peer to peer, there's no
intermediary, it's open source.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah, and it's one of these things that
just, you can very easily picture yourself

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
using it and needing it in the real world.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So picture this, imagine you wanted to
borrow some money from somebody right and

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
okay maybe you have some collateral and
you want to show this person that you are

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
trustworthy, right?

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So you're willing to put up some
collateral. But how do you do that? Do you

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
need a middleman? Do you need to talk to a
bank, like a broker, something like that?

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, we're going to do it on the
blockchain. And I'm going to show you

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
SigmaFi right now.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
SigmaFi offers peer-to-peer bonds. So
it's built on the Ergo blockchain.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And it lets users create loan requests
and somebody else can come along on the

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
other side of that and fund that loan.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And all the terms are transparent. So you
can really see what's going on. And you

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
can see what the collateral is.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You can see what the APR is going to be.
You can set the APR if you're making a

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
loan request.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So let's dig in. I'll share my screen
with you. And you can see what SigmaFi is

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
all about.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
All right, so whenever you open up
SigmaFi, this is important. This is not

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
terms and conditions to click accept,
right? Because then you're gonna become a

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
human centipede.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Read your assumptions, know your
assumptions, and you can check. You can

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
look in GitHub and see what all this stuff
is. And if you don't understand, you can

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
talk to the people in the community about
how it works and how to evaluate this,

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
okay?

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So every time you see this, don't just
click past it, but think about it. OK,

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
yes, I'm taking responsibility for this
bearer asset that I have.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And so I know that I'm using the product
at my own risk, and I'm responsible for

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
what happens.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
OK, so this is our dashboard here. And
these are all the active loan requests.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
To clean things up, they have hidden the
undercollateralized requests. I'll explain

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
what all this means in just a moment.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But you can see here there's not a ton.
And I think it's because the demand for

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
SigmaUSD is just really high.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You have pretty high APR coming from duck
pools and things like that.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And given the current market, it's a
little tough to come across SigmaUSD given

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
the reserve ratio is a little bit low.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But, so pretty much, if you want to make
a loan request, you can click this button

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
here, and you're going to be able to say,
or ask for, you're going to ask for, let's

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
say you want 500 SigmaUSD, and then you're
going to put up collateral, what you

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
choose.

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And so again, that's why some of these
are under collateralized, because people

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
are choosing to put up nothing or maybe an
NFT that doesn't have a strict market

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
value.

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So that would be up to you as the
potential lender in this case. But this is

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
a borrower created loan request.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So they're going to put up 1,000 ERG. And
they're asking to borrow this for nine

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
months.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
They are stating that they're going to
pay 20% interest. So this APR is like an

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
annualized rate.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So if this were 12 months, it would
actually be 27%. So that's way better than

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
your bank, I'll tell you that.

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You can look at the borrower's address,
and you could probably look up their

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
history and see if they have a bunch of
successfully repaid loans.

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
All it really is is you looking at these
terms and agreeing to fulfill that. So you

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
would send 500 SigmaUSD to this contract.

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Then you would, in nine months, receive
your 500 USD plus 20%. So that's 100. So

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
you would receive 600 SigmaUSD equivalent.

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I believe that's just coming straight out
of his collateral.

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And so why would somebody want to do
this? I think there's a couple of ways of

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
asking that question.

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why does somebody want to use SigmaFi?
First, that's really because this is like

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
a vending machine.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It is autonomous code that's been
published, and there's no intermediary. It

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
is like an automatic machine on the
internet.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And when somebody puts their money in it,
it makes this request and somebody else

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
comes and puts their side of the loan.

76
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It is handled really clean and it
executes automatically.

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So if this person does not repay their
loan by the end of this nine month

78
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
timeline, it actually gives them a block.
Yeah, it actually gives them a block that

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
they have to submit by.

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If it does not do that, then
automatically it liquidates this

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
collateral to make the user whole again.

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So like, super clean, fair, I think. I
think just personally, I've had these

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
interactions and loaned people money you
didn't get back, and there was no way to

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
enforce it without ruining your friendship
or something like that.

85
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And I know I keep using the word clean,
but that's how it feels.

86
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay. I also think the why of this, the
borrower creates the request, all right?

87
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So it's really, and so that keeps away
this attitude of loan sharking. You see

88
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,000
these rates, these are high because no
one's going to fulfill it.

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So it's kind of like a natural market for
this rate rather than it's like the

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
lenders are the only people who are
setting the rate and it would be way

91
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
higher than this because there's no
competition.

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This way it kind of empowers the person
who needs the money to kind of say what

93
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
they need and put up the collateral that
they can put up.

94
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So if somebody really needed it, maybe
they would put a bunch of collateral, like

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
more, to kind of show like, hey, this is a
super secure 200% backed loan, something

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
like that.

97
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Otherwise, you have these where it's
106%. I'm not going to do that, because

98
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
ERG is volatile.

99
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,000
If ERG drops another 6%, maybe I'm not
getting my SigmaUSD back.

100
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So that's why I want to use this program,
because everything is so transparent and

101
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
it's just very, very clear.

102
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And then there's also the why about why
would a borrower do this? Why is somebody

103
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,000
paying 20%? That seems really high. That's
like credit card rates, right?

104
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Let me tell you what they're doing. So
this is a way to get leverage on your ERG.

105
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So he is borrowing 500 SigmaUSD. Right
now, he's going to be able to buy about

106
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
600 ERG with that.

107
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And this is a bet that in nine months,
that 600 ERG is going to appreciate more

108
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
than 20%.

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So he's pretty much saying if ERG is
worth a dollar or more in nine months,

110
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
then he's going to come out ahead.

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So that is a bet. This guy's making a
bet.

112
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
On the other side, they're kind of also
making a bet, but it's much less risky. So

113
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
the lender in this case is accepting an
exceptional rate at 20%.

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So pretty much no matter what, they're
going to earn 20% or 1,000 ERG, which

115
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
sounds really great.

116
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The real risk here for them is that the
1,000 ERG in this collateral is worth less

117
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
than the 500 SigmaUSD.

118
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So that is just a very different risk
profile, in my opinion, a much smaller

119
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
one.

120
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Unless ERG puts in a new low, I mean, the
last time it was this low was like 2020 or

121
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
2021.

122
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Unless that happens, they're going to get
totally burned. This guy could get more

123
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
burned.

124
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
If ERG is kind of in the middle there, he
has to make that decision. Am I going to

125
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
pay back this loan, or am I just going to
let it get liquidated?

126
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He could not be able to pay back the
loan. Depends on how responsible they are.

127
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah, so it's really just a risk
management tool.

128
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And I really think that this is something
that will be used at some point, like by

129
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
miners.

130
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Like, okay, you're mining this. If you
can get to that point where you can put

131
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
this away, you can put your ERG away
instead of selling for your electricity.

132
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You can really capture a 20% increase in
your mining profits just by adding that

133
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
delay.

134
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Same goes for duck pools. I would love to
see duck pools being used more.

135
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Sometimes duck pools is nicer because
it's a little more liquid. You can always

136
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
get in and out.

137
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This is a little bit nicer because you
have some fixed APR and often high APR.

138
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Look at this guy.

139
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Okay, yeah, so I just big shout out
because I know that this is simple and

140
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
effective and really kind of elegant.

141
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Something that I struggle to understand
is why it isn't super popular.

142
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Like, okay, there's only six of these
loan requests that are over

143
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
collateralized. There's a ton that are
under-collateralized.

144
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And that just happens because, again,
people use things that don't have price

145
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
feeds or a price, or they just did some
token and they don't accept their dosage

146
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
or collateral, please.

147
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You get it. But we can come over here and
look at active bonds.

148
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
There's actually several, more than
several.

149
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah, I just appreciate it. I think a lot
of these folks were smart.

150
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I mean, especially those of you who did
it. Six months ago, 18 months ago, when

151
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
ERG was pretty high, you cashed out, you
secured some profit in SigmaUSD, and then

152
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
you lent it out, and then you're earning
an extra 20% or whatever that might have

153
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
been.

154
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The details of your loan are just kind of
individualized.

155
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So I really encourage people to check
this out. It's just a sound financial

156
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
tool.

157
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I remember being really young, my parents
were teaching me about CDs, certificate of

158
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
deposit.

159
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And they wanted me to put my money in to
an account that would earn, I think it was

160
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
like 6%.

161
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And I just had a job mowing lawns and
stuff. And so it was like a couple hundred

162
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
bucks.

163
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And I just thought, I was like, you want
me to do this for $6? Like, I'm not gonna

164
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
do that.

165
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Well, this is a different game. And now
we have the tools to kind of be

166
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
independent.

167
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And you don't have to give anybody a cut.
I already closed it. But I don't know if

168
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
you saw there. The fee for a bunch of
these loans was like $4.

169
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:19,000
OK, like that's really nothing. USD, 4.5
SigmaUSD.

170
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I think it's like 1%. Might be 1% of the
loan amount. So think about that. It's way

171
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
less than your realtor, I'll tell you
that.

172
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So head to sigmafy.app, play around,
check it out.

173
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Put your loan request in there if you're
trying to go long and fulfill some of

174
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
these open ones if you're trying to secure
those profits and just lock in that APR.

175
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
All right, I'll see you guys around.
