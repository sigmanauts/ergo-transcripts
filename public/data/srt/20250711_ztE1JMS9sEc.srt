1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Good morning.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here we go.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Good morning, kushti.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
How are you doing?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Happy Wednesday, Thursday.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Is today Thursday?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah, Thursday.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So, yeah, they're doing well.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
A lot of things as usual, so publishing a
lot, actually.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And we're watching 6.0 voting, so it's
going well.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I see that 97% of miners have put the
node in and are voting yes.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Right, right, right.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's awesome.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's very good.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I think on SigmaUSD we're still waiting
to compile a 6.0 modified node so that we

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
can run it.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And then hopefully we'll be voting yes as
well.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But we'll see on that.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's a little bit more of a process when
we're running storage rent.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So another step involved.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, I hear you're out of country.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You're on a trip.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah, so in Dubai currently, I met a
quite famous guy, Josh, a few days ago in

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
a coffee shop.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Just on his way to an airport.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's quite hot here, but still a lot of
people in the town are making some

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
meetings.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What do you wear outside when it's hot?

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
120 degrees Fahrenheit.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Unfortunately I still don't have Arabian
wear, you know, like those white clothes.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Probably the best choice actually.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But yeah, I'm just wearing like t-shirt.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But then, yeah, well, you can be bombed
by the sun quite quickly.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, yeah.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Are you giving any talks while you're
there, kushti?

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Sorry?

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Are you giving any talks while you're
there, or just private meetings?

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Just private.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So in regards with talks, not much
events.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So there were some meetups a few years
ago.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Now mostly dead, it seems.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And yeah, only big conference, it seems.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And they will be in October.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And then April, likely, like they have
what here, token.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
2049 the biggest problem is in Singapore
still but yeah Dubai version is also

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
getting steam then yeah well last autumn I
visited Cardano summit and there was

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Binance week around the same time.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Blockchain life and so on, yeah, so a lot
of conference, but usually, well, I don't

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
know, so I'm fed with those events,
probably, because yeah, it's mostly about

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
some marketing people selling some
nonsense and scammers, basically, a lot of

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
scammers around, right?

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So, yeah.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But yeah, so the plan for this year is to
visit BTC Asia maybe in Hong Kong in late

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
August and then yeah, Korean blockchain
week.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So we're already talking with some peers
in South Korea.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So yeah, well, probably we'll go there in
late September.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh, that's great.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's great.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I saw you had some comments in chat the
other day talking about the next big move

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
for Ergo, besides marketing or beyond
marketing, is building useful applications

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and pushing those out into the world that
everyday people could use and it's

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
integrated in the blockchain.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Right, but not just billing, so I believe
a lot of tools already there, right?

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So we just need people who will use them
and describe experience, right?

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And describe pros and cons.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah, like Bricks, for example, right?

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Your experiments with students' currency.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Right, right, right.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
MewDex, sorry, MewMart, those kind of
things.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There are quite a few tools already out
there that we can push out.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What else do we have?

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah, even DAO tooling, so yeah, I think
there could be a lot of options right

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
here.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yep, we have, I keep saying this every
once in a while, but SigmaLock as well.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
When that's done, CannonQ just pinged
them in chat the other day.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And I think there was just a temporary
pause on finishing up the development of

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
that, but they're getting to a point where
soon the UI will be connected to it and

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
built.

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So that'll be really interesting.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's something that you could
essentially sell as an alternative to any

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
crypto holder that wants to save and put
money away for their children or for their

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
partners or that kind of thing, with a
lock in place and with amount of keys that

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
you can hand to a lawyer or somebody else
with an expiry on block height or date.

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I mean, that's a real life tool that will
be available for the blockchain that

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
doesn't exist on Ergo right now
essentially in that capacity or many other

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
places.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So yeah, things like that are pretty damn
cool.

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That aren't possible elsewhere.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, so a lot of use case, right?

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And well, most useful I believe is also
quite simple, right?

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So don't require for complex smart
contracts or whatever.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Right?

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So in most cases, well, what people are
looking at is just for things like trading

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
like MewMart, cross-trading, right?

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Those lock-in schemes, multi-signature
does.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So yeah, like community currents.

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So yeah, I believe in most cases, it's
about simple stuff.

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Just people need to start using it.

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah, so I was thinking about this the
other day, because I was thinking back, I

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
think it was yesterday, the day before I
got home from my hiking trip, I was dead

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
tired.

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I felt like I wanted to die.

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And just going through stuff in my head
about some easy things that could be

107
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
pulled on chain and actually function
better on chain.

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And it gave me two thoughts.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
One was just a simple app that you could
make for helping to track your pets.

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Right now there's like, I think I pay $80
or $90 a year for the chip embedding in

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
our dog so that you can scan it if they
get lost.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But you could do a one-way blockchain
purchase and put the encrypted information

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
on chain, print off a QR code, put it on
their collar, and have the same effect for

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
cheaper.

115
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And it led me to the thought that I feel
that the blockchain enables people to

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
charge for proper effort.

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I think there's an imbalance in
corporatism or capitalism where demand is

118
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
king.

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So if one person's making an app that
does something, then they can charge

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
whatever the hell they want for it,
regardless of effort.

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What I'm trying to say is effort isn't
relational to price charged.

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And I think that's awful, right?

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I think that if you develop an app and it
takes you a day and you put it up on there

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and it's useful for people, that's great.

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But should it mean that you retire for
the rest of your life for something like

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
that while people charge out the nose for
kind of things?

127
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't think so.

128
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Some aspects of that.

129
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I think so if you develop a simple app,
you put it out there, then perhaps it

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
should be relational to the effort.

131
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And I think the blockchain brings back
that true, I guess you could say

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
competitive capitalistic spirit where
somebody else could come along and do your

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
thing for better and for cheaper.

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And that competition is right there.

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And the base startup cost, since the
blockchain is already there and set, is

136
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
wiped away kind of thing.

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So I appreciate that about the
blockchain.

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I think we should see more of that.

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I think we should see more
competitiveness in these scenes to kind of

140
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
get the price of things truer to the total
effort.

141
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's insane that they can charge you
close to $100 a year for storing a few

142
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
bytes of information on their servers,
right?

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
For this pet kind of thing.

144
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And there's massive amounts of things
similar to that.

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So yeah, so that's what I'd like to see.

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'd like to see the blockchain actually
push innovation and competition and have

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
effort equal value and cost in the future,
as opposed to these things where you buy

148
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
something digital, and they try to
digitally lock you from an upgrade path.

149
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Here's this little extra bit we're going
to give you.

150
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
To the company, it's like, what, it costs
them nothing to do that?

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
To develop that it's just an upsell on
that part and the only thing that's

152
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
locking you out of some stupid code that's
stopping you from accessing code that's

153
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
already on your system that you just can't
run it because you don't have access.

154
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So bullshit like that I feel.

155
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Hopefully the blockchain can really help
deliver against that, especially with open

156
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
source tooling and that kind of stuff.

157
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So sell yourself.

158
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Sell the way that you present your
business and the way that you run your

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
business as opposed to safely locking
yourself into code that nobody else can

160
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
use or steal so that you just have a
proprietary package that you give people

161
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and screw innovation or screw anybody else
from making it better.

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah, well I think Ergo is especially
about competitive capitalism, right,

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
because, well, there are no free money
here, right, to sponsor, like, parasitic

164
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
activities, basically.

165
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And no VCs, right, to just throw away
smaller competitors as well, again with

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:53,000
money being spent on unfair competition.

167
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You want something to win, you build it
better and you run it better.

168
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's as simple as that.

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That's the key here.

170
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Quite an amazing setting actually.

171
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I guess there's still chances for
corruption everywhere, but I feel that an

172
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
open platform with open source tools might
help stave that a little bit.

173
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah, and then we have AI, right?

174
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So even if some contract is not open
source, I believe it's pretty easy to

175
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
modify it with AI without ErgoScript.

176
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You still have ErgoTree written on the
blockchain.

177
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's a pretty high-level description.

178
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I think AI in particular can be quite
good about modifying it in certain ways

179
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
useful ways.

180
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So yeah and then yeah so 6.0 what is
going on and yeah so for sub-blocks there

181
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
is well updated DevNet seed nodes and yeah
I'm continuing to fix stuff and optimizing

182
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,000
things like daily so probably around the
next week yeah there will be another seed

183
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,000
node update and yeah, we can start
thinking about injecting sub-blocks,

184
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
supporting mining nodes into public
testnet from...

185
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's very exciting, kushti. Yeah, late
July maybe, so summer July.

186
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Awesome.

187
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So what would that look like in a normal
block on Ergo?

188
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
How many transactions will be packed into
a normal block supporting sub-blocks?

189
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So, well, after all, it will be the same
block being formed and written on the

190
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
disk, right?

191
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Right, right.

192
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It'll have the transactions or the hash
from the sub-block or something like that?

193
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah, so, well, current blocks would be
kind of like pruning mechanism, right?

194
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So, well, few blocks after, so sub-blocks
would be just erased, right?

195
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And you have just blocks for
bootstrapping new nodes, for example,

196
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
right?

197
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So, and yeah, for efficient storage on
disk.

198
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So yeah, so sub-blocks is just temporary
entity to be propagated our peer-to-peer

199
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
network, right, for quicker confirmation
and yeah, well, higher TPS as well.

200
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But yeah, well, still we have like
blocks, full blocks we have now, so they

201
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:08,000
would be just kind of archival mechanism
right for your notes.

202
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Okay so then yeah it's a kind of fractal
design right so you have sub-blocks, then

203
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
a few blocks after they've been pruned, so
you have only blocks.

204
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But then you may prune the blocks with
the help of NIPoPoWs, right?

205
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And it takes snapshots, so you can store
just less data with the same security

206
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
guarantees.

207
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Right, so yeah, all those things
supported since 2023.

208
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So, well, actually in the protocol
support is there since the mainnet launch

209
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
or even before.

210
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But now we have also well-supporting
clients, a lot of printing nodes and so

211
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
on.

212
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So yeah, that would allow to raise TPS
right for a minute.

213
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So you can just assume for a bit more
pruning in the network and raise TPS

214
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
accordingly.

215
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Well, there is no need to get into like
Casper setting, so store like three days

216
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
on the right, but that's also individual
choice.

217
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So you can store a few days.

218
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You can store the full history.

219
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So yeah, well, we can just do things like
default settings.

220
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Maybe at seven point, but yeah, well, a
lot of possibilities, right?

221
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Prune without reducing security of the
network.

222
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah, well, there are cryptographically
strong securities, and actually, well,

223
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
very strong securities based on weakest
assumptions, not involving any MoonMath,

224
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
crypto, all that stuff.

225
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So yeah, just certain things like hash
function properties.

226
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So yeah, pretty much the same
cryptographic security assumptions as in

227
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Bitcoin, but yeah, well, totally different
pruning capabilities in regards for secure

228
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
pruning.

229
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:46,000
A lot of options to explore.

230
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
There is a possibility to raise network
TPS significantly if needed.

231
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But, yeah, so unlike different shared
coins selling TPS and having empty

232
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,000
network, so I think, well, the focus
should be on providing some useful

233
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
capabilities to users, right, because,
well, TPS can be raised.

234
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There is foundation for it, but yeah,
it's not the goal to have theoretically

235
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
high TPS.

236
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I like the Ergo developed tooling and
actually useful things first and now we're

237
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
exploring security implications.

238
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Right, and then, yeah, so a friend of
mine just finished Git Circle spec, for

239
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
example, so it will be published, so,
yeah, well, developers, welcome to

240
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
contribute.

241
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Also for Dexy, for example, testing is
doing well, so, yeah, the bank reserves

242
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:08,000
are growing quite nicely, so yeah, we may
think now about updating Oracle pool, the

243
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:17,000
SigmaUSD1 to version 2, and then, yeah,
deploy.

244
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That's the best news I've heard all day,
kushti.

245
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Every other week kushti sends me a DM,
check your Oracle please.

246
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Like shit, I forgot to clean the dust.

247
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:42,000
The version to Oracle has some issues
with incentivization and so on.

248
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But it's probably a good time to update
the design, which is proven to be more

249
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
robust already.

250
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Do you think the Oracle set will expand
on the Oracle 2.0 for SigmaUSD?

251
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yeah, so we can have like 15 working
oracles like in gold, right?

252
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So, yeah, well, and we can then launch
GleomUSD, DexyUSD, right?

253
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah, but that would be quite interesting
because yeah, it seems after all, there

254
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
will be some revived interests to
algorithmic stable coins and now crypto

255
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
backed, I believe, because here after
Terra and other non-backed stable coins

256
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
are a failure.

257
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So it will be demand for crypto-backed
stable coins.

258
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And then things like Glion, Dexy.

259
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Very competitive, to say the least.

260
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Great, great.

261
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Speaking of 6.0, kushti, 6.1 has been
running flawlessly on the three

262
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
peer-to-peer explorers that I set up.

263
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's been fantastic.

264
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's nice and fast, very quick, very
nice.

265
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Please also check testnet mining.

266
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Is it down?

267
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
MGPy reported something.

268
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Let's see, testnet is... Oh yeah, it's
been down for 15 hours, my bad.

269
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Let me go kick it in my basement.

270
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah, but I believe we need more miners,
right?

271
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You do, you do.

272
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And you have one GPU, right?

273
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I've got like a 2070 pointed at it for
now, yep, something small.

274
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
All right, so then maybe, yeah, so we
need to find more miners to test

275
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,000
sub-blocks, all that stuff, like a couple
more miners at least.

276
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And then, yeah, maybe at some point we
can try side-chaining, right, to bring

277
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
TestNet ERG to mainnet to reward for
testnet mining.

278
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The concept which not right saying other
networks, but why not?

279
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Right.

280
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Let's see.

281
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I just rebooted my node.

282
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
That's how quick it is.

283
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And we'll see if it's going to come back.

284
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
See if it starts producing blocks.

285
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah, so we need to do something with all
those things, right?

286
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah, kushti, I'd love to be able to
incentivize node running eventually

287
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
somehow.

288
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I think that'd be great.

289
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Maybe just even testnet node, just a
small incentivization to run that.

290
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
No, but it will be just testnet mining,
right?

291
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Not running nodes.

292
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Right, testnet mining.

293
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Yeah, running nodes, so first we need to
define precisely, especially as in Ergo we

294
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
have a lot of modes of operation, right?

295
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So you can run nodes with when you take a
snapshot, for example, you may store all

296
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
the full blocks.

297
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So the first question is what to
incentivize here.

298
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So is it about storing all the full
blocks or just some suffix?

299
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Well, why?

300
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So why to choose a particular option?

301
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Incentivization options.

302
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So yeah, it's not quite clear what can be
incentivization desiderator about when we

303
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
are talking about incentivizing nodes.

304
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I haven't seen any clear answer yet to
the moment.

305
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Some things are possible even without
touching the core protocol.

306
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Once there was a scheme of running some
kind of proof-of-stake rewarding mechanism

307
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,000
on top of Ergo, an application as a
contract.

308
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So without touching anything in the core
protocol and this way you can incentivize

309
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
people who are running the nodes and
having a wallet unlocked, right?

310
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But maybe it's not the thing you are
willing to incentivize, right?

311
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Because well, it's not that secure to
have unlocked wallet after all in many

312
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
cases.

313
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeah, well, hard to say, so first we need
to define what to incentivize exactly.

314
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Well, what else is new?

315
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So, yeah, also started some writings and
some empty repositories for merge mined

316
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
sidechains.

317
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So, yeah, well, as usually we are after
delivery of something like 6.0, which is

318
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,000
now, and they're winning.

319
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So, well, we are working on sub-blocks,
right, but planning the next thing.

320
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
So, much more inside chains.

321
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So, yeah, it's time to plan and maybe
start developments.

322
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And yeah, this time it will be done in
Rust.

323
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So, yeah, probably most of development
then should be done by other people

324
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
because I'm not even strong in Rust.

325
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So then, yeah, it's about a lot of
questions, how to incentivize developers

326
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
and so on.

327
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But yeah, I believe it should be there,
right?

328
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Because a lot of ideas, well, what to
build from private side chains to like

329
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
very compliant ones.

330
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:59,000
To double merge mined sidechains, for
example, like Bitcoin and Ergo merge mined

331
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:08,000
at the same time to allow for more
trustless Bitcoin DeFi, right?

332
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And then, yeah, to have... Sorry.

333
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Then to have a partner chain of Cardano,
which is also merge mined chain of Ergo.

334
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
To have, well, in regards with privacy,
it can be like compliant privacy, like

335
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Midnight-based merge mined sidechain.

336
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So a lot of ideas, but anyway, we can
start working on merge mined sidechains

337
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
right now.

338
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Okay, so what's up kushti, what's the
Braid thing that Joe posted about last

339
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
night?

340
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Better Money Labs Braid.

341
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So yeah, it's, well, exactly. Double
merge mined sidechain idea so still while

342
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
writing white paper so yeah we will be
published in coming days maybe but yeah

343
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
well in the first place discussing with
some partners so the idea you know is to

344
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
avoid like developing something which has
no interest right from outside, so to

345
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,000
unbubble with development efforts as well
now, right, so with double merge mined

346
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
sidechains.

347
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So Braid is a double merge mined Bitcoin
plus Ergo sidechain, and yeah, we are

348
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
talking with some big Bitcoin mining pools
and so on, right, in regards to supporting

349
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
it.

350
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Then, yeah, we can try for more options
like to have midnight powered and so on.

351
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
But yeah, there is also needs from the
users adoption side.

352
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So yeah, well, considering different
options here, so stay tuned.

353
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
All right, cool, very cool.

354
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Well, as far as the meetup going, just a
reminder that everything's posted on

355
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Twitter.

356
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'll probably post again this week for
signups.

357
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Joe got me in contact with the building
owner that we're renting out for the

358
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
event.

359
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And she's going to actually help with
some of the planning and the setup.

360
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So that's great.

361
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
We'll do some troubleshooting and not
troubleshooting, but some brainstorming

362
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
and get that all nice and welcoming for
everybody that's in attendance.

363
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But otherwise, the order of events is
pretty much nailed out.

364
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
We have to do some sort of community vote
on what the hackathon is going to be

365
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
about.

366
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And then the final result will be hidden
and revealed during that hackathon.

367
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So that'll be fun to watch.

368
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I gotta get my streaming equipment ready
and packed up so that I'm not missing

369
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
anything when we're streaming everything.

370
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I think we'll bring everybody's screen
that's hacking into one interface so

371
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
people can watch people coding live.

372
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
So I think that'll be fun.

373
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And then with drunk commentary by myself
and Joe.

374
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Trying to understand what's going on that
could be even more fun.

375
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So we'll see how that goes.

376
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
But looking forward to it.

377
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Looking forward to being in Colorado in
October and seeing people face to face.

378
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
kushti, did you get a chance to, are you
going to go to the consulate after you

379
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
return from Dubai to see if you can get a
visa?

380
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So it seems no chance because I don't
have a biometric passport.

381
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It would take some time.

382
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Can we at least zoom you in and have you
give us a hello during the conference,

383
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
during the meetup?

384
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah, so, yeah, and I can try to get a
biometric passport, but yeah, probably

385
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
that's, so with the traveling plans, can
do that not earlier than the meetup

386
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
itself, so like.

387
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Right, right, right.

388
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
So then next year maybe, but yeah, let's
see, so.

389
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah, it seems that the US is one of very
few countries with such demand, actually.

390
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah, even to just... Right, we can't
even fly domestic anywhere without a real

391
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
ID, which requires quite a few different
proofs of citizenship and life and other

392
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
things.

393
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So, that change just happened recently.

394
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So, yeah.

395
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Yeah, so let's see.

396
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I mean, there is some option which I can
try in August.

397
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
But yeah, the chances are small, to be
honest.

398
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Okay.

399
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
But yeah, we'll be happy to join remotely
anyway.

400
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah, that'd be great.

401
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Maybe next year, yes, so we need to do
something with this biometric stuff.

402
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
All right, cool.

403
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Cool beans.

404
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And as far as P2P infra that I talked
about last week, we had about four or five

405
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
people sign up already that would like to
be sent a machine that's ready to go.

406
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So that's on my task list for the next
month or so.

407
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'll build these machines up and then run
and sync.

408
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I'll probably just clone some of the P2P
servers that I have set up already and

409
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
ship them out to the people that want to
run it.

410
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And then we'll slowly add them to the
load balancer to make sure everything's

411
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
OK.

412
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Once we have a secure network of known
machines spread across the globe, we'll

413
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
start bringing other people who just want
to run their own thing and be part of that

414
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
load balancer.

415
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Depending on your internet bandwidth,
that's how we'll do the calculation of how

416
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
much load balance we'll send to you.

417
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
If you have 5% of the bandwidth as other
people running on the load balancer will

418
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
send you 5% of the traffic kind of thing
or maybe less depending on what that is.

419
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So we'll all do that to make sure that
the nodes are spread and the load balancer

420
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
across the globe and that we're not
overburdening certain nodes from certain

421
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
people.

422
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And then hopefully we can turn off or
turn down the Ergo Foundation's load

423
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,000
balancer with the rented servers on
Hetzner.

424
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And then we could be a truly kind of
peer-to-peer decentralized node hosting

425
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:14,000
DAO for Ergo, which I think fits
perfectly, will be great.

426
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So I think for July a lot of news, right?

427
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So it's kind of hot, especially here.

428
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So to be honest, yeah, well, I'm working
quite slowly these days because it's crazy

429
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
hot here.

430
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So I can't do much with that.

431
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It's like plus 41 Celsius, but it's in
the desert.

432
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So I think in the city, it's like closer
to 50 probably Celsius.

433
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
But yeah, I'm trying here.

434
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So published a forum post on some idea
for a sidechain yesterday.

435
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Yeah, I can do more.

436
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And yeah, over the weekend, some
weekends, hopefully we'll investigate

437
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:24,000
those private chains coming and already
spending some time actually on studying

438
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Crescent chains with private contracts
such as Aleo, dark DeFi, Midnight, and

439
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:40,000
yeah, well, would be good to have private
contracts in a sidechain, right?

440
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So, yeah, well, we'll write more coming
days.

441
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So, also checking a bit VM stuff for this
double merge sidechain.

442
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Yeah, it seems well, that's BitVM 3 which
was announced just like three weeks ago.

443
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So it's already broken.

444
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:16,000
So just two days ago one guy had written
the chart with some critical analysis.

445
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So yeah, it seems BitVM 3 is broken.

446
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
But yeah BitVM 2 is quite good still and
allowing for somewhat trustless transfer

447
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,000
but yes still still need to check but yeah
a lot of startups actually working on such

448
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,000
stuff already so we can just reuse the
work problem right so oh yeah well and for

449
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:46,000
sub-blocks i think to write something in
august maybe well feedback by Sasha will

450
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,000
be done by then.

451
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
He promised to provide some, so Sasha is
a developer from Casper, also quite active

452
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
in R&D.

453
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Right, he joined the R&D anniversary AMA.

454
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Yeah, that was quite amazing, right, when
people are just joining without asking for

455
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,000
permission or whatever, so yeah.

456
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Alright, let's see.

457
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
We might have a few questions here we can
bang out, kushti.

458
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Let's see.

459
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Yeah, so let's have questions.

460
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm sorry, it seems I have like seven
minutes or something like that.

461
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
You gotta leave in seven minutes?

462
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yeah, so I need to go to some meeting.

463
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yeah, I tried to figure out.

464
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But yeah, like 10 minutes maybe, yeah.

465
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Okay, all right, let's see.

466
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I guess as Kent was asking about me, the
small app I was talking about for dogs, he

467
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
says, why do you need a record for your
dog's movements?

468
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Ursa Minor answered him.

469
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
But in general, the way these simple apps
kind of work is that a user goes to a

470
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
website, puts some information like the
phone number, the dog's name, perhaps a

471
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
state or a town.

472
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Maybe you don't want to put your actual
address on it.

473
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
That gets encrypted and put into a smart
contract that that person can then change

474
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
and update.

475
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And a QR code is printed out with the
decryption hash or key of essentially the

476
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
password to decrypt the file, to decrypt
the text on chain.

477
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And that is painted to a QR code that the
person then puts on the dog's collar or

478
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
the cat's collar.

479
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And then if it's lost, it just says scan
me, you scan it, takes you to a website,

480
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
shows the information.

481
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So the difficulty, what you pay for right
now in the outside world, is you pay for

482
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
the ability to update it, right?

483
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Because you could put a little chain on
your dog and have it chisel out.

484
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And if it doesn't wear off, that's fine.

485
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
But people enjoy having either the chip
in their collar or something else that

486
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
they can update and never have to change
it physically.

487
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
So that's essentially what you're doing
here.

488
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
You're saying, look, we can put this on
our pet, and if we move, we can update it

489
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
by spending the UTXO on the chain,
updating it.

490
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
The code stays the same for the data,
essentially, and that's all you have to do

491
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
kind of thing.

492
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
So that was kind of the idea for that.

493
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
But the main point of that story was that
there are so many things outside that you

494
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
can utilize the tooling and the structure
of Ergo for that will actually work better

495
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
than the outside world.

496
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Not everybody wants to blow a hundred
bucks on that kind of service or not

497
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
everybody wants to spend money that they
could spend less of if using

498
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
infrastructure that's globally hosted and
peer-to-peer and things they could change

499
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
themselves.

500
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So that was the main intent of that kind
of story, not necessarily relative to the

501
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
pet app itself, but in general, things
that can be created utilizing the

502
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
blockchain that are beneficial and cheaper
for people.

503
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Let's see, Kento Crazy Fast says that, do
you need to run the node to mine the

504
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
testnet, or can you just point your rig at
your stratum server?

505
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So the idea here, Kento, is that the more
nodes...

506
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
So I'm running a testnet node, right?

507
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I think I'm the only... No, there's three
other people running testnet nodes, but

508
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I'm the only one mining at the moment for
testnet.

509
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So if people point to my testnet node, my
stratum to mine, and it goes down, then

510
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
testnet's down, right?

511
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
So there's no redundancy there.

512
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Ideally, you'd want to run your own node
and you'd want to run your own stratum and

513
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
mine to it.

514
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Then if my node goes down, your node
keeps producing blocks because you're

515
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
mining to your node.

516
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
That's the idea.

517
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Granted, if you want to point to my
stratum, that's fine.

518
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Then if my miner goes down, which is on a
different machine, then you're still

519
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
mining it.

520
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So there is some redundancy in the miner
there, but it's not a full redundancy as

521
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
if I lose full interconnection, even
though my stratum, my node, and my miner

522
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
are on three different locations.

523
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
My stratum's in Hetzner, my node is at my
house, and my miner's mining testnet's

524
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
here next to me at work.

525
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
So there's some redundancy.

526
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It's some safety there if you do want to
point to my stratum.

527
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
So yeah, I think I had MGPi pointing to
my stratum briefly or somebody else.

528
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So yeah, you're welcome to do that if you
want to ping me, Kento.

529
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Oh, here we go.

530
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
kushti, do you know the answer to this?

531
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Evidently, 80k Bitcoin received from P2P
KH wallets with no activity since 2011.

532
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
How is that possible?

533
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Do we know any more news about that or
how that may have happened?

534
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I don't actually know what's surprising
in those transfers.

535
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Back in the days, I know some people with
Bitcoin from 2010-2011 and having

536
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
thousands of Bitcoins were quite...

537
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It's like having 10k, 20k ERG now, right?

538
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It's just ordinary thing, you know, so
it's nothing surprising.

539
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I know one guy from my city.

540
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:56,000
He got into Bitcoin in 2010 and then got
enthusiastic and started to reward.

541
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So he started to promote Bitcoin around
some gaming forums, right?

542
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Because they were GPU guys on the forums.

543
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So he spreads mining software links
around forums, got banned for spreading

544
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Trojan likely rights, because it was
totally crazy stuff back then, like some

545
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
internet money with some software able to
get the money.

546
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So probably Trojan, so yeah, he got
banned immediately.

547
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And then he started to buy some guys with
reputation on those forums, you know, and

548
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:50,000
paid like 100 Bitcoin to each guy, making
a post about Bitcoin.

549
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,000
That's like us now paying 60 ERG for a
mug.

550
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Right so yeah so i mean that's that was
just quite ordinary so i don't know why

551
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
now journalists are writing all those
articles about you know some wallets

552
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
moving bitcoin not touched since 2010
because yeah i'm pretty sure there are a

553
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
lot of such words rights just ordinary
guys which just left Bitcoin in those

554
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
wallets and that's it.

555
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And yeah, about ATK, so I don't know,
there are some theories, right, like Roger

556
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Ware or not Roger Ware or whatever.

557
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And yeah, so actually, all those talks
are quite motivating in regards with

558
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,000
having more privacy.

559
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
But yeah, the sad thing is privacy is
coming with less efficiency, much less

560
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
efficiency.

561
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
So, well, if we are talking about TPS, it
would be much less when we are going to

562
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
shielded amounts, for example, right?

563
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,000
So, well, even optionally shielded
amounts.

564
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And I'm not saying about even more
privacy.

565
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
So yeah, it's a hard talk, but yeah, I
mean, it's better to have privacy rights

566
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
to avoid all those investigations.

567
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Yeah, I'm reading the article right now
about using OP_RETURNs for Mt. Gox claims.

568
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Interesting.

569
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,000
That doesn't seem like, maybe I'm looking
at something different than Ursa Minor is

570
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:48,000
asking about, but this looks more like a
social engineering masquerading attack.

571
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I don't think, unless we're talking about
something different, Ursa, it doesn't seem

572
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
like an address hat from what I'm reading.

573
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:06,000
It seems like they are just claiming
legal ownership of it via that process.

574
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Yeah, I'll read more up on that.

575
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
That's interesting.

576
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Let's see.

577
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
What else?

578
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
You got one minute.

579
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Do we have any more questions?

580
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Oh, Congo says he's going to spin up a
testnet.

581
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I know that's fantastic.

582
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
That's it, kushti.

583
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:30,000
You got time to go to your meeting now.

584
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Enjoy your summer, right?

585
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:40,000
If you have summer in Southern
Hemisphere, it's winter, right?

586
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah, then what else?

587
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So stay tuned, a lot of news coming.

588
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yeah, what else?

589
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So, yeah, I think we may have some more
community chats, right?

590
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Because we didn't have many around.

591
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,000
So yeah, I didn't want to organize
because I was tripping around.

592
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
So yeah, let's try.

593
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,000
And I have made more videos, for example,
on sub-blocks this month.

594
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
That'd be great.

595
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
We'd love to see videos on sub-blocks,
kushti.

596
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
That'd be great.

597
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
We could use those as clips on Twitter
and social platforms as well to build up

598
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
the hype and understanding of it.

599
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
All right, all right.

600
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So yeah, you have to run.

601
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
All right.

602
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Thanks, guys.

603
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Thank you, everyone.

604
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Enjoy your time.
