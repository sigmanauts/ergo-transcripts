00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today I'm excited to present PandaVee, a
project that combines blockchain

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
technology with modern access control.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Introducing the PandaVee project.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We've built a blockchain-based access
control system powered by the Ergo

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
blockchain.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Each user's entry rights are verified
using a unique token ID, replacing

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
traditional cards or passwords with a
secure on-chain identity.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Every access event is immutably recorded
on the blockchain, ensuring full

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
transparency, traceability, and
tamper-proof security.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Whether it's for office buildings, event
venues, or smart doors, PandaVee offers a

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
secure, modern, and reliable solution for
access management.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
In this video, we'll show you how we use
the Ergonode and ErgoPay to activate our

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Arduino-based hardware and unlock the
door, live and on-chain.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Start the Ergonode and PandaVee server.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Release build PandaVee app to Android
mobile phone.

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Plug in module and compiling upload
PandaVee sketch.

18
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Arduino version and Wiegand version will
be integrated.

19
00:03:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Here is what we're using and we'll take a
minute to build up our Arduino access

20
00:04:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
control system.

21
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:53,000
First, power up our system.

22
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Open PandaVee mobile app.

23
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Log in using ErgoPay signing.

24
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Session ID will be recorded in PandaVee
server.

25
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Here is list of NFT tokens from this Ergo
wallet.

26
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Click token to generate QR, binding
session ID with wallet address for this

27
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
weekend.

28
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Scan the token QR code.

29
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Server will determine if this QR is
valid, then access granted, gate or door

30
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
will open.

31
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Transaction will be pushed and submitted
to Ergo blockchain.

32
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
All transaction IDs can be checked at
Ergo Explorer.

33
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
More mobile app functions will be made in
the next coming video, next enhancement.

34
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We'll integrate database records and
improve mobile app functions.

35
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Integrate with some more access products
and hardware.

36
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We're still working hard to learn both
hardware and software.

37
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hope everyone still supports Ergo and us.

38
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Thanks Ergo and all friends that we got a
chance to step into blockchain technology

39
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and wish everyone happy Ergo anniversary.
