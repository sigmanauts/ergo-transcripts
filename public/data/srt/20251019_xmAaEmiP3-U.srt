1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, so I am Cheese Enthusiast and I've
been working on Lithos, the future of

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
proof of work mining.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So let's talk about the goal of Lithos.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The Lithos team has a vision of bringing
transparency and decentralization to proof

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
of work mining.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Specifically, this is related to mining
pools.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now, mining pools have existed for a
while.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
They are just a way for miners to
essentially come together, take all of

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
their hashrate, and produce blocks in a
way that allows them to get consistent

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
payments.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Mining pools are currently quite
centralized, but there have been attempts

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
to decentralize pools in the past.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
One attempt that I worked on previously
was smart pools on Ergo, if you remember

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
getblock.io.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We worked on a way to essentially make
the payments of mining pools completely

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
transparent.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now, smart pools was a novel technology
at the time, but we found that there were

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
still many centralized aspects to mining
that could not really be solved using the

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
sort of setup that smart pools had.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
For example, the pool operator inside the
SmartPool system had full control of the

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
backend.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They could change whatever they wanted in
terms of what a miner worked on, like

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
their shares, or how much they got paid.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They also had complete control over the
block production.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
For example, the transactions that go
into the block, any storage rent that was

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
claimed from the block, etc.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So the goal of Lithos is really to try
and decentralize all aspects of the mining

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
pool and make sure that miners can mine to
pools in a way that still allows them to

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
get their consistent payments.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But at the same time, do it in a
decentralized manner.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So let's talk about centralization in
proof of work mining.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So mining pools in general, obviously
they have some benefits in terms of

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
allowing more miners to enter the mining
space with less hashrate and then

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
therefore get more consistent payouts.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But proof of work mining pools haven't
really been perfectly decentralized and

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
they have a lot of issues associated with
them.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So it started as a decentralized process
where individual miners competed to solve

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
these complex mathematical problems.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's turned into a centralized system
where the largest mining pools have

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
significant control over the network and
can potentially manipulate it for their

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
own benefit.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
For example, while it may not necessarily
be likely, mining pools could perform 51%

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
attacks on the blockchain.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
They could also act in bad ways to get
rewards for miners that they deserved.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Or they could even change what
transactions go into the blocks that are

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
being mined.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That way they can censor certain
transactions.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You may have heard about this happening
on Ethereum, for example, where certain

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
mining pools ended up censoring
transactions to tornado cash, which was

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
seen as sort of a bad thing because it's
about mixing the cryptocurrency and

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
preventing people from figuring out where
the cryptocurrency came from.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So in general, mining pools have a lot of
power and they're able to do all these

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
things like censorship, potentially steal
rewards, etc.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So the concentration of power in the
hands of a few large mining pools is a

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
serious problem.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And it kind of goes against the vision
that Satoshi Nakamoto had when he

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
originally came up with the idea of proof
of work and its application in

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
blockchains.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So proof of work today is still very
important.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's still widely used as a consensus
algorithm in the cryptocurrency industry.

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But with the introduction of mining
pools, it has fundamentally changed.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It is much more about the mining pools
and the power that they have rather than

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
the individual miner and what they're able
to provide.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And this has introduced significant risks
to the security decentralization of

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
various networks.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'd say the main issue is really that
mining pools have complete control of

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
payments and block production.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So payments obviously is about how miners
get paid for the work that they produced

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
while they were mining a block.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Mining pools have complete control over
this in that they can essentially go into

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
their database, see whatever shares that a
miner produced, and they can change it on

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
the fly to whatever they want.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So if let's say a mining pool has some
sort of personal vendetta against a miner,

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
they could theoretically give that person
less rewards.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Additionally, mining pools have complete
control over block production.

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Block production is really important in
my opinion because it is essentially the

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
way for miners to insert their own
transactions or allow whatever

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
transactions they want while they're
mining to the chain.

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Mining pools have complete control over
what goes into the block and what kind of

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
transactions are allowed.

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
As I referenced earlier, there was a
whole tornado cash scandal on Ethereum

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
where certain blocks were censored when
they contained transactions from this

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
tornado cash app.

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And this kind of really goes against the
whole idea of decentralization in the

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
first place.

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We want people to be able to essentially
submit whatever transactions they want,

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
have them picked up and then put on the
blockchain.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Censorship from mining pools goes against
this completely.

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So the goal of Lithos is really to handle
these two problems.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Make sure payments are completely
decentralized and make sure block

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
production is in the hands of the miners
themselves.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So what are we solving?

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So the first problem are mining pools are
black boxes that are lacking transparency.

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
They hurt decentralization in this way,
and they have some history of being bad

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
actors within proof of work
cryptocurrencies.

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So to fully solve this problem, we have
to fully decentralize mining pools and

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
place them onto the blockchain using smart
contracts.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So by doing this, we ensure transparency,
we ensure fair payouts, and we really

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
empower the miners to do more versus the
pool operators who may not necessarily

100
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
have the best interests of the blockchain
in mind.

101
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You also ensure like a more efficient
flow of capital from the coin emission

102
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
directly to miners without presence of
middlemen who can manipulate the fees

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
without any rules.

104
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Now, our second problem is that mining
pools require trustless and fair

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
distribution.

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And normal mining pools rewards are
distributed to miners by keeping track of

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
partial block solutions, also known as
shares.

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Mining pools keep track of millions of
shares.

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They have databases usually that
essentially keep track of each miner's

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
shares and how many shares they submitted
during the mining process.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
When a block is found, mining pools look
through the database and decide how much

112
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
work the miner produced for the mining
pool in order to determine how much they

113
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
got paid.

114
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now, we want to decentralize mining
pools, but on the blockchain, we do not

115
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
have the storage capacity to store
millions of shares.

116
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's just not viable.

117
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It would cost too much.

118
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So in order to solve that, Lithos came up
with this idea of the non-interactive

119
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
share proof.

120
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So non-interactive share proofs are
essentially a way to compress the amount

121
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
of work that a miner produced into a small
handful of shares, and then that handful

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
of shares can be verified on the
blockchain using various smart contracts

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
to determine how much work a miner
produced over a certain period of time.

124
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Non-interactive shared proofs, or NISPs,
are used throughout Lithos.

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And they're used to ensure that miners
are paid fairly according to the amount of

126
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
work that they produced while a block
solution was being found.

127
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
NISPs are computationally very simple to
evaluate and determine whether or not a

128
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
miner is lying about how much work they
produced.

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Additionally, storage wise, they do not
require a lot of space on the blockchain.

130
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And in a place where space is very
limited, NISPs are able to compress the

131
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
amount of data and make sure that costs
associated with the mining pool itself are

132
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
not too high.

133
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
NISPs themselves are essentially a
collection of around 10 shares with high

134
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
difficulty that are used to determine how
much work a miner produced.

135
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
They do this through concepts borrowed
from NIPoPoWs, actually.

136
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Specifically the concept of goodness and
the idea that when a person is mining over

137
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
a large period of time, it is almost
certain that they will produce a number of

138
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
large high difficulty shares throughout
that mining process.

139
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
NISPs use this idea to essentially prove
that a miner performed work by checking

140
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
whether or not they produce those high
difficulty shares.

141
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Now, in order to store NISPs on the
blockchain, they are very small, but

142
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
still, we want to be, when we're dealing
with smart contracts, we want to be as

143
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
efficient as possible, space and
computation-wise.

144
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So the current idea of Lithos is to use
an optimistic rollup to evaluate each NISP

145
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and ensure that while computation isn't
too high, we can still ensure that people

146
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
are being provably fair and are being paid
according to the actual amount of work

147
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
that they're producing.

148
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Sorry.

149
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So decentralizing mining pools requires
ensuring that there is some amount of

150
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
censorship resistance.

151
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Now, on Ergo specifically, the Coinbase
transaction has been made so that it must

152
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
go to the public key address of whichever
miner mined the block.

153
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So in order for censorship resistance to
really be possible on the Ergo blockchain,

154
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
we need to do what's called
collateralizing the Ergo.

155
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And what I really mean by that is to
provide an amount of Ergo equal to the

156
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
block reward before the block is mined.

157
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Now, when the block is mined, that Ergo
amount given by the lender is distributed

158
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
to the miners as the block reward, while
the actual block reward, which goes to a

159
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
certain public key address, is given to
the lender's address instead.

160
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So in this way, you essentially allow for
miners to create their own block, set the

161
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:13,000
public key reward address of the block to
the lender, and then allow the actual

162
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
payment to instantly go out to all the
miners whenever the block is verified.

163
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So this is important for a few reasons.

164
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
For one, it does allow censorship
resistance in the sense that any miner can

165
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
mine their own block while still ensuring
that the reward of the block goes to all

166
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
other miners in the pool.

167
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's also very useful in the sense that
when you're normally mining on Ergo, there

168
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:54,000
is a certain 720 block wait that you must
do before the block is confirmed.

169
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And during that wait, nobody is able to
be paid.

170
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Collateralization essentially cuts
through this process and allows miners to

171
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
be paid almost instantaneously whenever
the block is found.

172
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So we want to ensure that we have these
collateralized mining pools because we

173
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
want to ensure censorship resistance.

174
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
We want to avoid these problems like I
called back to before, like with the

175
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
tornado cash issue.

176
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
We don't want mining pools to censor
certain transactions.

177
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That is really one of the core goals of
Lithos to ensure that miners have complete

178
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
control over the blocks.

179
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And giving control to miners over block
production, that also allows miners to

180
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
gain more ERG.

181
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
They're able to add storage rent
transactions specifically for ERGO.

182
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And are able to produce ERG through MEV.

183
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And MEV was a big part of the reason why
Ethereum, while it was proof of work, was

184
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
able to gain so many miners.

185
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
MEV allows miners to gain additional
rewards through smart contract

186
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
interactions, DEXes, stablecoin contracts,
etc.

187
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And we want to be able to bring that to
ERGO, but give that power of choosing what

188
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:33,000
actually goes into the MEV to the actual
miners themselves versus the mining pools.

189
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
One important aspect of collateralization
is that we don't want to prevent miners

190
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
from immediately joining our decentralized
pool without having ERG.

191
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Now, if we force miners to collateralize
themselves, that means, let's say a new

192
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
miner comes into the ERGO ecosystem, they
have zero ERG in their wallet, and they

193
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
want to join a Lithos pool.

194
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
If they have no ERG in their pocket and
collateralization requires at least an ERG

195
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
amount equal to the block reward, then
this kind of clashes with the idea of any

196
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
anonymous new miner being able to come
into the system and provide work to the

197
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
ERG blockchain and then secure it.

198
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So Lithos specifically has focused on
third-party collateralization.

199
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And that means that people outside of
miners themselves are able to provide ERG

200
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
to the mining pool to collateralize the
block.

201
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And that would allow new miners to join
without having any ERG at all and

202
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
therefore mine on this decentralized pool
without having to put up some amount of

203
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
ERG that they may not already have.

204
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Collateralization also allows people
outside of mining to gain ERG by using

205
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:11,000
pool fees in a way that is contractually
obligated to not be sort of suspicious.

206
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
For example, like a normal centralized
mining pool may be able to adjust their

207
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
fees any way they want.

208
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
With Lithos mining pools, the fees will
be determined by the smart contracts,

209
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
determined by the market of
collateralization itself, by all of these

210
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
lenders who want to provide ERG to the
blockchain to help secure it.

211
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
This also goes into the Lithos token.

212
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Now, Lithos token tokenomics are not
particularly set yet, but the general idea

213
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,000
is to incentivize miners to mine using
Lithos and allow them to gain additional

214
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:05,000
rewards despite the pool fee that they pay
to the collateralizers.

215
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So let's go into some of the more
technical aspects of Lithos now.

216
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Lithos protocol is an advanced
decentralized mining pool protocol.

217
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
There have been some mining pool
protocols in the past that have been

218
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
somewhat decentralized.

219
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
A few examples that I can name is P2Pool
on Monero has been running for a while.

220
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And that is essentially a sidechain on
the Monero blockchain that allows miners

221
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
to mine to the sidechain and then gain
rewards of Monero.

222
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Now, it is decentralized.

223
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
However, it faces a lot of problems in
that block production is still not

224
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
entirely on the miner's hands, as well as
rewards are a little bit obfuscated.

225
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It doesn't help that Monero is a
completely private blockchain, but

226
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
essentially it's not the most ideal
solution.

227
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Now, we've had smart pools on Ergo as
well.

228
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
These were a good idea, I think, but they
didn't fully decentralize the entire

229
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
process of mining.

230
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
There was also another smart pool
initiative on Ethereum while it was proof

231
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
of work.

232
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It was also quite decentralized, however,
it lacked efficiency.

233
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And that's something that is really
important to us at Lithos.

234
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
We want Lithos to be scalable.

235
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
We want it to be able to potentially
handle hundreds of thousands of miners at

236
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
once.

237
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And past solutions to decentralized
mining haven't been able to do that.

238
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So the first technical aspect, and I've
talked about it recently, is

239
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
collateralized mining pools.

240
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And we want collateralization to
essentially ensure that block production

241
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
is in the hands of miners.

242
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
We want miners to gain MEV rewards.

243
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
We want miners to be able to have control
over their storage rent.

244
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
We want to avoid censorship of any
transactions at all.

245
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And another technical aspect here is the
non-interactive share proof, which is

246
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
really, I think the most important part of
Lithos and it completely changes how

247
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
mining is done.

248
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Mining, traditionally, on a mining pool,
you get your mining software, you connect

249
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
to the stratum, and you produce hundreds
of thousands of shares over a period of

250
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
time.

251
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The mining pool takes these shares, they
store in the database, and they determine

252
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
how much work you did by looking at the
amount of shares multiplied by the

253
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
difficulty that you mined at.

254
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And obviously, this is not good enough
for a smart contract.

255
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It just takes too much space and
computation.

256
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So NISPs are the alternative.

257
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And they ask sort of a different question
of the miner.

258
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Instead of asking how many shares did you
produce over a period of time, we're

259
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
asking, can you produce, say, 10 shares at
a high enough difficulty to prove that you

260
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
did a certain amount of work while the
block solution was being generated.

261
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And this kind of change of the question
has a big implication in terms of how

262
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
mining works on Lithos.

263
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You're not going to be mining in the
traditional way.

264
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Obviously, you'll still have a mining
software, you'll still have a stratum that

265
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
you connect to, but the way your rewards
are calculated are completely different.

266
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You are not simply adding up the number
of shares and then dividing it based on

267
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
the total number of shares produced by the
pool.

268
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You are essentially proving that you did
a certain amount of work by producing

269
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
these high value shares.

270
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And then that allows you to store all
this data in a small space.

271
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
NISPs also are very important because
they are computationally efficient and

272
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
they're efficient storage-wise.

273
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
We can use optimistic roll-ups to allow
for greater scalability with the smart

274
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
contracts that we're using.

275
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Now, an optimistic roll-up, you can think
of it as a layer two solution that is

276
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
essentially it's taking all these NISPs
and it's assuming that each NISP is going

277
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
to be completely successful and valid.

278
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Unless it is checked upon.

279
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Now, in Lithos, we plan to have lots of
off-chain bots that will be checking each

280
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
NISP submitted to the blockchain.

281
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And if a NISP is found to be fraudulent,
a fraud-proof transaction is submitted,

282
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
and that NISP is removed from the
equation.

283
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
This is really important because we're
not evaluating each share proof on its

284
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
own.

285
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
We're only evaluating share proofs when
we know they're fraudulent.

286
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And what I mean by that is we're not
evaluating share proofs on the blockchain.

287
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Obviously, evaluation is happening
off-chain, but we're really focused on

288
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
on-chain evaluation because that is what
is costly.

289
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And fraud proofs allow for us to minimize
the amount of computation on-chain while

290
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,000
allowing the majority of computation to
happen off-chain, where computation is

291
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
easy to do and there are way less limits
regarding data and space.

292
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
There will be incentive to submit fraud
proofs.

293
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Now, usually with roll-ups, we have what
are called sequencers.

294
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And sequencers can be kind of thought of
as people who are submitting their

295
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
roll-ups to smart contracts and then
getting some kind of reward for that.

296
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
In Lithos, we want everybody to
potentially be a sequencer.

297
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And a sequencer is kind of equivalent to
a pool operator in that they're the ones

298
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
getting the shares and submitting them.

299
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Now, obviously, we want individual miners
to have the power in Lithos.

300
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So anybody can be a sequencer,
potentially.

301
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But in general, there will be some limits
because obviously if we allow anybody to

302
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
be a sequencer, then there's a classic
problem with blockchains in that people

303
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
can spam the blockchain.

304
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So there will be some limits in regards
to who can be a sequencer, but the general

305
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
idea is that the limits will be low and
that people will be able to become a

306
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
sequencer with a certain amount of tokens
and then submit these transactions to the

307
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
smart contracts themselves.

308
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
All right.

309
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So another important aspect of Lithos is
that, oh yeah, yeah, no problem.

310
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Oh, no, absolutely not.

311
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Because the difference is that when I say
a high difficulty share, the difficulty or

312
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
the high difficulty is relative to a
difficulty the miner themselves chooses.

313
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So if I have, say, like my laptop right
here and I decide to mine on it, obviously

314
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I can't produce many high difficulty
shares.

315
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I just don't have the computational power
to do that.

316
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But on Lithos, you choose your own
difficulty.

317
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You choose what difficulty you mine at.

318
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And that means that a high value share
for you is different than a high value

319
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
share for somebody with 20 GPUs in the
back, for example.

320
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So when I say a high difficulty share,
it's relative to your own computational

321
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
power.

322
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And this is important.

323
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And I'll get more into it later about how
your difficulty is chosen and the kind of

324
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
effects that has on your payouts, how much
you get paid, and how often you get paid.

325
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Now, for Lithos, the usage of
non-interactive share proofs means that it

326
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
is essentially completely blockchain
agnostic.

327
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So non-interactive share proofs are
really only evaluating the difficulty,

328
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
which is the value of the share or how
high the actual number is compared to the

329
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
target value that the blockchain wants you
to find when you're looking for a block.

330
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Because we're only using math,
essentially, to determine whether or not

331
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
you did work, it's completely blockchain
agnostic.

332
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And what that means is that you can use
NISPs on something like Bitcoin, something

333
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
like Litecoin, other proof-of-work
currencies, Caspa, Alethium, all of these

334
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
currencies which are using traditional
proof-of-work algorithms, you can use

335
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
NISPs to evaluate how much work somebody
did.

336
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
What that means is that we can have smart
contracts on the Ergo blockchain, which

337
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
allow you to mine in a decentralized
manner while still mining to Bitcoin.

338
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
So you can mine Bitcoin while mining on a
decentralized pool.

339
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Same with Litecoin, same with Casper.

340
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So ideally, the collateralization in that
case would work using RAP tokens, for

341
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
example, from Rosen.

342
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So in that case, you would have RAP
tokens that are paid to the miner on the

343
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Ergo blockchain, while the actual block
reward would have to go to somebody on the

344
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
initial blockchain, for example, Bitcoin.

345
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And that lender would have to be somebody
from that blockchain, essentially.

346
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So it would be a little bit more
complicated and it would require some

347
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
support from, for example, a bridge like
Rosen to completely successfully do, but

348
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
it is completely possible.

349
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Now, I mentioned the Lithos token
earlier.

350
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Now, lenders who provide collateral will
be using the Lithos token to essentially

351
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
provide that collateral.

352
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And that would allow miners to...it would
allow a sort of proof of work economy to

353
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
occur because miners on Lithos will be
mining, just for example, ERG, and they'll

354
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
be also gaining these Lithos tokens at the
same time.

355
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And those Lithos tokens would be used by
lenders to essentially lock in their

356
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
collateral for miners to use.

357
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And the idea behind this is to
essentially stimulate a healthy economy

358
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
between people who mine and people who
don't.

359
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And it would allow people to essentially
gain money without having any

360
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
computational power, which is usually not
possible on a proof-of-work blockchain.

361
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
On a proof-of-work blockchain, you can't
secure the blockchain without some

362
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
computational power, usually.

363
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
But the idea of Lithos is to have people
who are not associated with the mining

364
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
world necessarily to still help
decentralize the blockchain itself.

365
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Yeah, exactly.

366
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It is similar to staking, but it's a
little bit different in the sense that

367
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
it's not really percentage-based in the
sense that having more tokens will

368
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
necessarily get you more.

369
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:41,000
But it's still a way for people who are
not involved in mining to gain some money

370
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:50,000
while still securing the blockchain.

371
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I mean, I don't think it should be any
issue between Rosen and Lithos.

372
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,000
What do you mean by dual miners?

373
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Oh, no, no, no.

374
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
No, I don't think so.

375
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I mean, the way Lithos is working is just
a normal stratum.

376
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
So you can do anything that you do with
your normal mining pools as long as it

377
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
works with a stratum.

378
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So I know some people do dual mining, for
example, where they partition part of

379
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
their hashrate to, say, Bitcoin and some
of it to Ergo.

380
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You could do the same thing on Lithos
without any real issue.

381
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
We're using stratum to allow things to be
compatible in a way that doesn't require

382
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
miners to update too much.

383
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You don't have to upgrade anything.

384
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You don't have to change your general
setup.

385
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But you're still able to benefit from the
general idea of Lithos itself and the

386
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
decentralization.

387
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So let me explain it.

388
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
When somebody mines or somebody is
producing a number of hashes over a period

389
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
of time, we can mathematically prove that
somebody producing a certain amount of

390
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,000
hashes over a period of time will almost
certainly produce a certain number of high

391
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
difficulty shares while hashing.

392
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So what that means is that while they're
producing all of these random hashes,

393
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
there's all random numbers.

394
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So for, let's say that person produces
these hashes over the course of an hour.

395
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
They will mathematically produce a
certain number of high number of hashes

396
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
that will be present inside their set of
hashes that they produced.

397
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So Lithos is taking advantage of that
fact that they mathematically will produce

398
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
those number of hashes to prove that
somebody actually produced or actually did

399
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
a certain amount of work.

400
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So if I'm a miner and I want to get paid
on Lithos, but I didn't actually do any

401
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
work, right?

402
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I just want to say that I mined for 12
hours straight and I produced all these

403
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
hashes, but I actually haven't done the
work myself.

404
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
To prove that I did the work, I would
have to have a certain number of

405
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
high-value hashes that I could show to a
smart contract to show that I actually did

406
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
the work.

407
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
But if I'm lying, I wouldn't have those
high-value hashes in the first place.

408
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
They wouldn't have existed.

409
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
So that's the general idea of a NISP, is
to use the fact that high-value hashes

410
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
will be produced over a certain amount of
time, and that they will be produced at a

411
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
certain ratio relative to the number of
hashes that I did throughout the period of

412
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
time.

413
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
If I'm lying, I won't have those
high-value hashes to present to the mining

414
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
pool.

415
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And therefore, it'll be quite easy for
somebody to see that I'm being fraudulent.

416
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah, exactly.

417
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And there are obviously other aspects
that must be verified.

418
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
For example, I don't want to accept
high-value hashes that were produced like

419
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
a year ago.

420
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I need to make sure that the timestamp on
these block headers is valid for the block

421
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
that we're mining.

422
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I don't want to have a hash from two
years ago if I'm mining a block from an

423
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
hour ago.

424
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
So there are other sort of qualifications
that need to be met for a NISP to be

425
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
valid.

426
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And these are all checked through these
fraud proofs on the roll-up for the Lithos

427
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
protocol.

428
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Does that answer your question?

429
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Exactly, exactly.

430
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That is all decentralized in smart
contracts, yes.

431
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
The logic itself is being run off-chain.

432
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
We don't want to have that computation of
checking each and every share inside the

433
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
NISP.

434
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
That would take a lot of time.

435
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
We're doing the logic off-chain.

436
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
We're checking each NISP off-chain.

437
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And if we find an issue, we're producing
a fraud proof on the blockchain to ensure

438
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
that fraudulent NISP is taken off of it.

439
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And there's a certain value of incentive
to do this.

440
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
If I'm a miner, I don't want some other
miner to take some portion of my money

441
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
because they produced a fraudulent share.

442
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
If I'm a miner, I am therefore
incentivized to make sure that each share

443
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
on the Lithos protocol is valid and not
fraudulent because I want my block reward

444
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
to be maximized.

445
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Remember, block rewards are being
separated between each miner inside the

446
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
pool.

447
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
So if I remove a miner who was fraudulent
from the share of the reward, then I get

448
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
more of a reward proportionally for
myself.

449
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So there's a certain incentive to make
sure that miners are always checking each

450
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and every NISP that is submitted to the
Lithos protocol to make sure that they get

451
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
paid maximally according to their work
that they produced.

452
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Makes sense?

453
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
All right, cool.

454
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So let's talk about the testnet now.

455
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
So after around one and a half years of
work and the release of Ergo 6.0, the

456
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Lithos testnet is nearing launch.

457
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
The testnet serves as a way for miners to
try out all the new aspects of Lithos.

458
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And it's also to help me find any bugs
that were produced during this process.

459
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Already found a lot of bugs while
developing it, so I can't imagine how many

460
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
bugs will be there.

461
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
But really, the goal is to try and iron
out all of these issues before anything

462
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
gets released to the mainnet.

463
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So now, tying back to what you and others
were talking about, mining on Lithos is

464
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,000
going to be a little bit different to
traditional mining.

465
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Now, for one, the Lithos client is
providing a local stratum for you to mine

466
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
towards.

467
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So what that means is that your stratum
or the pool that you're connecting to is

468
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
going to be locally produced.

469
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
That means there's never a chance of
stale shares.

470
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I don't know if you've mined before, but
stale shares happens when the latency is

471
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
too high and the difficulty that you're
mining at is not equivalent to the

472
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
difficulty that the pool wanted you to
mine at.

473
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
So when that happens, it's just lost
money, lost work for you, right?

474
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So having a local stratum means that
stale shares are not going to happen.

475
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Additionally, miners on Lithos are
solving a different problem.

476
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And this is going back to NISPs and how
they work.

477
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So let's talk about difficulty now.

478
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So normal mining pools are asking the
miners to send a certain amount of shares

479
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
at a set difficulty.

480
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So if I go on, for example, Herominers
today, I'll go on their 4G port, and I'll

481
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
be producing shares at the value 4G.

482
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So 4 times 10 to the 9, I think, is the
value that I'm trying to produce shares

483
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
at, submitting any share above the value 4
times 10 to the 9.

484
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Right?

485
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Now, this is not viable, as I've said, on
a blockchain.

486
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
So Lithos is instead using NISPs.

487
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And NISPs are really asking a different
question.

488
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Can I produce, now for Lithos right now,
we're using a value of 10 shares.

489
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So the question that Lithos is asking is,
can I produce 10 high value shares

490
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
relative to the difficulty that I chose.

491
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And if I can produce those 10 shares,
then I did produce a certain amount of

492
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
work at that difficulty.

493
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So using this allows us to make things
more efficient, make it more

494
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
computationally efficient, more storage
efficient.

495
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And it also changes how you mine.

496
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So as I said before, on Herominers, I'm
mining at a set difficulty of 4G.

497
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Miners with different hash rate than me,
they're probably mining at that same

498
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
difficulty.

499
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I could have 100 megahashes, or I could
have, let's say, 10 gigahashes of hash

500
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
rate.

501
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And I would still be mining on the 4G
port.

502
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
On Lithos, it's completely different.

503
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
The difficulty that I'm mining at is
relative to my own hash rate.

504
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So if I'm mining at, say, 100 MHz, I will
be mining at a different difficulty

505
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
compared to the person with a mining farm
who's mining at 20 GHz.

506
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And what that means is that between the
two of us, we need to produce different

507
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
value shares to prove that we performed
work at our difficulty.

508
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
So let's say I'm mining at 1G, for
example.

509
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Maybe I need to produce 10 shares at 5G
to show that I performed work at 1G.

510
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Now, if I have 20 gigahashes of hashrate
power, I might be mining at, say, 20T, I

511
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,000
think is the next one.

512
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I'm not sure.

513
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Let's say I'm mining at 20T, then I need
to produce 10 shares at like 50T.

514
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
So the meaning of this really is that the
difficulty that you choose is directly

515
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
tied to how much you get paid, because the
difficulty is your way of showing that

516
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
you're mining at a certain hash rate.

517
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
So this has some effects on how you're
getting paid.

518
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So for example, over...

519
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
So yeah, that is important.

520
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
So the time scale for Lithos is relative
to the usually some set period of time

521
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
before the block was found, because when
the block is found, all shares are

522
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
submitted and then they're evaluated.

523
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
So we don't want miners to kind of lie
and say, oh, I produced 10 shares like two

524
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
weeks ago and a block wasn't found until
now, but my 10 shares are still valuable.

525
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
They're not really as valuable generally.

526
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So we want to take shares that were
produced within a certain period of time

527
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
before the block was found.

528
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
For example, let's say 12 hours before
the block was found.

529
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
You need to find 10 high value shares
produced within that 12-hour period and

530
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
then submit them when the block was found
to show that you performed work while the

531
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
block solution was being generated.

532
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And this essentially prevents people from
lying about what work they performed and

533
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
when.

534
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
We don't want people to have fake shares
that are coming from the future or shares

535
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
that are no longer valuable from the past.

536
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
We want the shares to be produced while
the current block is being mined.

537
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Now, because you're able to choose your
own difficulty on Lithos, and you're able

538
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
to determine what difficulty you want to
mine at, there can be some, let's say,

539
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
funky things that happen if you decide to
stray away from whatever the Lithos client

540
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
gives you.

541
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
So the Lithos client will look at your
hash rate, and it'll give you sort of a

542
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
set difficulty relative to your hash rate
that you can mine at.

543
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Now, you're free to change that
difficulty value to whatever you want.

544
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So let's say I want to be a little bit
risky, right?

545
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I want to maybe gain a little bit more
money.

546
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
So what I can do is I can set my
difficulty value higher.

547
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And what that means is that my payments
will not be as consistent.

548
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
The reason for that is, at my hash rate,
I will not be able to reliably produce 10

549
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
high value shares for that difficulty.

550
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:59,000
However, because my difficulty is related
to how much I get paid, if I do produce 10

551
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
high value shares, I get paid more versus
me mining at my normal difficulty.

552
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Exactly.

553
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You're trading your consistency of your
payments for the potential reward of how

554
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
much you get paid.

555
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So that can happen if you increase your
difficulty.

556
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Now, lowering your difficulty, in
general, it doesn't actually have much

557
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
value because lowering your difficulty,
you're just lowering your reward.

558
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And if you're already getting paid
consistently enough, then it's not that

559
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
useful.

560
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Now, if you're having trouble with
payment consistency for some reason, then

561
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
you can lower your difficulty and get paid
consistently more often while sacrificing

562
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
some amount of reward for that consistency
in the first place.

563
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
This is, I think, is a little bit foreign
to, I guess, most miners, probably.

564
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
It's not really the traditional way of
mining.

565
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Usually when you mine, you mine at a set
difficulty.

566
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
The number of shares is sort of
proportional to how you get paid.

567
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Here, it's all about the difficulty that
you mine at.

568
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And changing that difficulty will change
how you get paid.

569
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
How much you get paid, how often you get
paid.

570
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
So you're able to play around with this.

571
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Maybe you're feeling risky one day, want
to increase your difficulty, and you get

572
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
your big payout.

573
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Or you increase your difficulty, you
don't get paid for three days, and you go

574
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
back down because you feel like you didn't
get anything out of it.

575
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:33,000
So the Lithos client will be the main way
for miners to interact with the testnet.

576
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I want to put instructions out for the
Lithos client, ideally at the end of the

577
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
month.

578
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Still working on currently the HTML UI
for it.

579
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Currently, it's just a terminal UI that
you could type in certain commands into.

580
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
But I understand that most miners may not
necessarily want that.

581
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
So I'm working on an HTML UI, sort of
akin to how the node works.

582
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
If you've ever run your own node, there's
an HTML panel that you can connect to

583
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
where you can put in certain commands.

584
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
The Lithos client will be pretty similar
to that.

585
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So the current testnet, my goal is to
release the testnet week of November 2nd.

586
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Really, the last thing I'm working on is
these interfaces, the HTML interface, and

587
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
some of the off-chain code to tie
everything together.

588
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
We have a lot of the contracts done, a
lot of the code related with the contracts

589
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
done, as well as a lot of the stratum code
done.

590
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Now, the current stratum that is being
used in Lithos.

591
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
It is a completely new Java-based
stratum.

592
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Worst thing I've ever worked on in my
life, by the way.

593
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So hard to do for no reason.

594
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
But so right now it's only supporting two
miners, Riggle Miner and NB Miner.

595
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
My goal is to start supporting more
miners like Team Red Miner, SRB Miner, et

596
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
cetera.

597
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
But those will happen probably as the
test net goes along.

598
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
With the initial release of the test net,
we're going to be supporting just those

599
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
two mining softwares.

600
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
But yeah, that's really it.

601
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
That's the presentation about Lithos.

602
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:41,000
You guys have any questions?

603
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Right.

604
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
So with this client, the current way I
have it is that there are a few options.

605
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Right now, it just automatically can
build the block for you.

606
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And what that does is it really takes
whatever transactions with the highest

607
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
fees are inside the mempool.

608
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It takes those transactions and it puts
those inside of the block.

609
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
MEV is obviously possible.

610
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
It's not currently supported in the
testnet, but it's definitely very easy, I

611
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
think, to implement.

612
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
It would probably require using the HTML
UI that I'm creating.

613
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Or there could be certain presets to try
and get more value out of, for example,

614
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Spectrum DEX transactions.

615
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Additionally, storage rent is
automatically claimed by the client.

616
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
So any storage rent UTXOs that are
available to claim at the time of the

617
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,000
block will automatically be claimed and
given to the miner of the block.

618
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
So in general, that's really how the
transaction selection block production

619
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
works.

620
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Right, right.

621
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Currently, it's prioritizing max fees.

622
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:06,000
So if you're not putting in transactions
with high fees, then get the hell out.

623
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Right.

624
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Exactly, exactly.

625
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And miners can also plug in their own
transactions, not necessarily MEV itself,

626
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
but let's say you want to, I don't know,
maybe you want to fund some Ergo raffle

627
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
contract or something, right?

628
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
But you don't want to wait for the
mempool to go through.

629
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You can put in your own transaction while
you mine your block, and it will be put

630
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
inside the block without having to pay any
transaction fee because you're the one who

631
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
mined it, right?

632
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:47,000
So that's also possible as well.

633
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
With merge mining, you said?

634
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
So merge mining, it should be actually
the same because the way merge mining

635
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
usually works is you have your mining
software and it is connecting to various

636
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
stratum pools and Lithos protocol itself
has its own stratum connection that you

637
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
can connect to.

638
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
So if I want to merge mine like Zcash and
Ergo, for example, I can mine to both of

639
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
them have the different stratum addresses
inside my mining software config and it'll

640
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
work normally.

641
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Essentially, there shouldn't be any big
difference.

642
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:56,000
That is probably true, but you can adjust
your difficulty to a lower amount so that

643
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:03,000
you can find high value shares according
to whatever hash rate you're mining at.

644
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
So obviously, yeah, when you're merge
mining, you won't have as much

645
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
computational power, but you can adjust
that so you still get paid at a consistent

646
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
amount and for a fair value according to
the amount of power you're putting in

647
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
towards ERG.

648
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

649
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
It can accept Babel fees.

650
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
OK, I kind of get what you're saying.

651
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I guess for chain agnostic things, there
will have to be at least one transaction

652
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
on the opposite chain.

653
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Yeah, yeah.

654
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
So I guess that transaction will probably
be required to pay some sort of fee.

655
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
And that would be by the lender who's
collateralizing on the other blockchain.

656
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:03,000
But for example, the actual payments
which are being done on the Ergo

657
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:14,000
blockchain, that can use Babel fees for
the payouts going to each miner on the

658
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:25,000
pool.

659
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So the incentive is a pool fee, right?

660
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
However, I think the difference is that
at least the current idea for

661
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
collateralization is to have it be an open
market.

662
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So because miners in the end are the ones
producing the block at their local

663
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
machine, they're able to choose what
public key address the mining reward goes

664
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
to.

665
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So what that means is they're able to
choose what lender they want to receive

666
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
the reward and therefore the pool fee
itself, right?

667
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
So essentially you can think of it as an
open market and whoever's providing the

668
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
best fees is, that's who miners are
incentivized to choose for their

669
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
collateral.

670
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And that means like, let's say I'm a
lender who is providing 35 ERG as the

671
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
block reward, right?

672
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And I'm taking a 2% fee.

673
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
The miner could look at all the other
collateral UTXOs out there on the

674
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
blockchain, and they can find one that's
maybe for 1%.

675
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
They'll use that instead.

676
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So in that way, it ends up being most
likely standardized at a certain level.

677
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And lenders obviously have some incentive
to try and increase the fee.

678
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
But at the same time, they're also
requiring the Lithos token, which is

679
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
coming from miners.

680
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And in that sense, the idea is to have a
sort of balance and a sort of proof of

681
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:02,000
work economy that allows lenders to
provide their ERG and gain additional ERG

682
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:11,000
back, while allowing miners to sell their
Lithos token to these collateral

683
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:20,000
providers.

684
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So I think that is theoretically
possible.

685
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
However, one thing to keep in mind is
that as miners gain more ERG, they can

686
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
collateralize the ERG themselves.

687
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
So then they don't have to pay a fee for
themselves.

688
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And then at that point, you're almost
always incentivized to use your own

689
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
collateral if you have the ERG for it.

690
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
So third party collateralization is
mostly for miners who don't have the

691
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
actual ERG amount to collateralize
themselves.

692
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And this is for new miners who have never
mined inside the ERGO ecosystem before, et

693
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
cetera.

694
00:54:49,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So in that sense, that's what third party
collateralization is used for.

695
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Right, right.

696
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
So, for example, if you've ever
solo-mined a block on Ergo, you get the

697
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
block and then you have to wait 720 blocks
to have that block confirmed, and then it

698
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
goes to this certain address, your mining
reward address is what it's called, and

699
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
then you can spend it from your wallet.

700
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
When we're collateralizing what the
actual miner of the block is doing,

701
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
they're changing the reward address to the
address of the lender.

702
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
They're getting that block reward in 720
blocks now.

703
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
But the collateral that they provided is
being instantly paid to all the miners.

704
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And the difference is that the collateral
they provided is going to be a slightly

705
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
less amount.

706
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And that slightly less amount that's
being missing is the fee that the

707
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:09,000
collateral provider gets at the end after
720 blocks.

708
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Sorry, can you repeat that?

709
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Right, yeah, that's the current idea
right now.

710
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Right now, that's actually not
implemented in the testnet.

711
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Right now, anybody can provide
collateral.

712
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:30,000
But the idea is that miners who mine on
the pool will get Lithos tokens.

713
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And then in order to create a collateral
contract that will be used as collateral

714
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,000
for any blocks being found, you will have
to stake some sort of...

715
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:49,000
You'll have to lock a certain amount of
Lithos tokens inside of that UTXO.

716
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
And that sort of ensures that there's
sort of a market for collateralizers to

717
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
get Lithos tokens and for miners to sell
those Lithos tokens to those

718
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
collateralizers.

719
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:08,000
So collateralizers, they get the Lithos
tokens, they get gain on their ERG, and

720
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:17,000
then miners, they're selling those Lithos
tokens to those collateralizers.

721
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I'm not gonna lie, I haven't determined
the exact amounts yet.

722
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I'm still thinking about the tokenomics
of the Lithos token.

723
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
It hasn't really been my main focus.

724
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:39,000
My main focus has been having a usable
protocol and then I feel that tokenomics

725
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:50,000
after will be more important.

726
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:58,000
It doesn't have to be confirmed, does it?

727
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Yeah.

728
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Theoretically, yes, it does not have to
be ERG.

729
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
However, the lender will be paid in ERG
no matter what.

730
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Yeah.

731
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
But yes, theoretically, the collateral
could be anything that they want.

732
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
And if the miners choose, for example, to
get paid in SigmaUSD, they could if they

733
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
wanted to.

734
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Yeah.

735
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Yeah, no, I definitely, I think that's
fair, honestly.

736
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I initially did not even think about a
token, but I felt like I want to

737
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
incentivize collateralization and
incentivize people to join decentralized

738
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
mining pools, because honestly, most
miners...

739
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
They want whatever works, right?

740
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
And they see a stratum on Heropool.

741
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
They're going to go join that.

742
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
They're not going to join Lithos.

743
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
So I feel like there should be some sort
of incentivization for them as well to be

744
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
part of a decentralized mining pool.

745
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
And in that way, we're enforcing, we're
ensuring that more people will join this

746
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
decentralized mining pool.

747
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Because they're getting paid a little bit
extra, right?

748
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:17,000
And that's not to mention as well MEV and
storage rent, which will be additional

749
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:28,000
rewards for them to join a decentralized
mining pool as well.

750
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
No, I think it's tough because especially
these days, a lot of tokens are useless.

751
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
In my opinion, there's a lot of things
that don't need tokens that have them.

752
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
So definitely it's something I thought
about with Lithos as well.

753
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Do I need a token?

754
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Do I want a token?

755
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Is it really necessary?

756
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Currently, right now, I feel like a token
will be useful in that sense.

757
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
But right now, the main focus has been
the protocol, making sure that works.

758
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And then tokenomics will be most likely
the last thing I work on.

759
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I don't want to prioritize it because it
is important.

760
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
It's not the main focus of the protocol
itself.

761
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:22,000
The main focus of the protocol is
decentralizing mining.

762
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
It is kind of similar to that, I believe.

763
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Yeah.

764
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Yeah, I think it's an interesting idea.

765
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,000
And it allows people who aren't mining to
gain ERG.

766
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
And I feel like that's been a big pain
point for some people in the Ergo

767
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
ecosystem.

768
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I've heard that mentioned before in the
past.
