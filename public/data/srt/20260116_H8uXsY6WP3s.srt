1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Connecting, streaming, I think we're
live. Welcome, everybody. I hope we're

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
live. We'll see. I'll verify in one second
on the channel.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And welcome to another Ergo community
chat, this time themed on AI, vibe coding.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I hate the word vibe coding, but I guess
it's popular. By joining us to start, and

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
hopefully more of you join, we have the
join link in the Zoom in the bottom of

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
this video on YouTube, if you go there, as
well as the Telegram chat. But joining us

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
right from the start are the infamous and
famous kushti and HQ. How are you guys

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
doing today?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Doing well, doing well. So yeah, because
of the topics of vibe coding for the whole

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
day to get the better idea of what to talk
about. But yeah, well, these days

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
sometimes vibe coding a lot when it comes
to writing tests. Yeah, also playing with

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
basis. Server, basis tracker server, and
yeah, it's almost fully vibe-coded.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Wow, and I just heard in dev chat, right,
Louis Vatra made an entire node out of

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Rust purely vibe-coded. Was that recent?

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah, well, the only question is how
secure is running it. I mean, if miners

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
are going to run it, then yeah, well,
probably a lot of hard forkish divergences

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
with the reference clients. That's what
we've discussed. And yeah, so some

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
divergence already now. Very cool.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You trust Fitz? We can bring him in?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, all right.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let me make him co-host so that he can
actually turn on his camera and mic. All

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
right, you're good, Fitz. HQ, how you
doing? Good morning, sir.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah, good morning. So about vibe coding,
I just vibe coded Android mobile dApp. I

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
just tested testing working with the front
end and just build a WorldPay frontend for

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
it so you guys can swap.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So you got an APK we can download and run
kind of thing?

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No, it's just that you just need a URL
after dApp and you go to your mobile

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
wallet, you go to the dApp section, you
paste the URL and you get the UI there. So

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
you just need to sign the DEX and that's
it. So you don't need to go to

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
WorldPay.store. So you will just have the
swapping inside. Like Cake Wallet has this

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
- it's in wallet swapping. So you would be
able to buy ERG or you will be able to

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
sell ERG for any other blockchain assets.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's amazing, sir. That's fantastic.
How long did that take you?

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I told you it was vibe coded. So it took
me maybe one hour because there are so

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
many components which don't work in
mobile. So for example, I was trying to

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
build a card with a toggle and drop down.
It doesn't support that. So I had to make

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
it simple as it can be. So now I'm just
working on the backend stuff and then just

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
getting it done and we will see how it
goes.

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Well, let me kick start, right? I'm going
to kick start with some examples. And I

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
know HQ, kushti, Fitz, you can't see my
screen. But if you go to YouTube, you'll

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
see what I'm looking at. If you go to
YouTube and watch the stream, you should

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
see with a 30-second delay what I'm
actually going to be showing you.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So I jumped on the Vibe Coding Wagon a
bit as well. I was kind of inspired by how

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
much output Rob was doing with Degen's
world, with all that stuff he's been

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
outputting. So I was like, hey, you know,
there's been some stuff I've been meaning

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
to output. Let me try again. And the goal
of my outputs were to create something

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
that could interact with the Ergo
blockchain and be kind of unstoppable,

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
right? That nobody could take down, there
was no central server or anything like

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
that.

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I came up with the first thing that I
came up with with this app right here.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's called Site. It's an HTML file hosted
on IPFS. It's got transaction building

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
built into the HTML. It's about 10,000
lines of code for this one HTML file that

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
can be pushed. And what it does, it allows
you to do some sort of reporting online.

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And I'm not going to say or mention all
the things that can be, because I'm sure

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
some bad reporting things or things that
are against laws could be reported on this

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
kind of thing, which we'd want to
discourage, but it's out of my control at

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
this point.

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You can come, you can put in a tag, you
can see there's a node. I held a

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
competition last week offering I think
about $187 worth of Mu token, HQ's Mu

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
token, for if we can get about 67 nodes to
self-report on this site app right here.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's as simple as just typing in a filter.
The filters are scanned at the refresh of

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
the page. Let's see if I can get it to go.
I'm going to refresh here. And you can see

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
right here that we're scanning. We scanned
everybody's wallet, essentially, for where

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
we scanned the blockchain for a certain
kind of token, which is made at creation

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
for this. It parses them in. You can see
there are 17 BERT, seven valid. So it's

65
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
showing these seven nodes. We can actually
filter by date as well. And we can filter

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
by actual time tag as well.

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We can hover over these two. And you can
see that, well, if I zoom in here, you can

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
see I should have two data points right
here. Yeah, you can see I put in the

69
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
middle of the city my personal nodes and
my Cornell nodes right there. And you can

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
see there are some other nodes that have
started self-reporting as well here.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That's one that didn't put a note. That's
one that did. That's netims node. And then

72
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I have a backup node in Singapore as well
that I put there. So this could be

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
anything. This could be, I think, HQ, you
were talking at one point of making an app

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
like this for flooding, so people could
report flooding on chain for that kind of

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
thing. Fires, dangerous presence of
whatever. So that's the idea. As long as

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
you have a NIPoPoWs node to be able to
submit to the blockchain that you can

77
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
point to and this IPFS link, you can do
reporting and you can't be stopped by

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
filtering or anything like that. It's
unstoppable as far as that goes.

79
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And in the spirit of unstoppableness,
I've put in a section two where you can

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
put in your own Explorer and API for Node,
so that even if something's blocked, you

81
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
can point to somebody else's and use it,
or use your own node on your local phone.

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We know Rustin can run that. So that's
that. It's really easy to report features

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
here. You can use mobile or Nautilus I
added recently, all built into the HTML.

84
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There's a small proof of work anti-spam
verification that actually creates a hash

85
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and nonce. So it's anywhere from 0 to 20
seconds when you click it. That's

86
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
essentially to stop people from using this
UI or to spam the network with stuff. And

87
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
it will not, our tokens won't even be
viewed on this page for display unless

88
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
that nonce is there, right? So that's kind
of a verification that you're tokens won't

89
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
even consider it as part of this map
unless you've done that proof of work for

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
that kind of thing. Then you generate the
link, and you send it out in a post within

91
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
a minute or two. It'll show up on that
site. So that's called Site.

92
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Another thing that I threw on here as
well with Vibe Coding straight up

93
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
interacting with Ergo is Say. And that's
kind of a Twitter alternative where you

94
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
can link up your wallet, you can mint a
token, and that token is then read on

95
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
chain. You can see when I refresh that
it's loading all the say's, and then it

96
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
verifies that each say has actually been
minted by the wallet that it's held in.

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So, you know, if there's a lot, it could
take a little bit, but you can see that

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
there's quite a few here, and it hasn't
taken a bit to load it all. You can follow

99
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
people, so you can type in up to 10
addresses, and it will show you everything

100
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
in their says right there. You can even
put in somebody's address. So I could put

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
in HQ's address and see who he follows as
well, kind of linking to that by clicking

102
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
down and seeing that. And we can load our
feeds down there.

103
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Say is just easy. You're putting your
wallet address, what you want to say. Same

104
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
thing with anti-spam verification publish.
It opens it up in your Ergo mobile wallet

105
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
as well. You can also mint a token that
lets you browse a user's say, essentially.

106
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And you can create a profile token so that
if you look, it says my name right here,

107
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
QX, as opposed to somebody just posting
their wallet. And I think somebody else

108
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
minted a token. Yeah, YongQ as well minted
a token. So that'll stay in your profile

109
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and show up there as your name instead.
And of course, there's info here on what

110
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
it is. Just like on the site page, there's
info on what it is. And even on the site

111
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
page, there's info on how the transactions
are or how it's all built together as

112
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
well.

113
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Now, you may say that, you know, how do
you make sure that people are using the

114
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
latest version of that you've built of
site or say, and that's the one thing that

115
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I've linked back to myself, essentially.
If you look down at the bottom of these

116
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
pages, you'll see an updates. And all this
is doing is the HTML is hard-coded to

117
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
check in my wallet for an NFT that is
named a certain way, and it reads that

118
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
from there. So even if somebody is running
an older version of Say or Site, they can

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
see and hear that, hey, it should be
version 1.2 in the upper left-hand corner.

120
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
If it's not, click this link, bookmark
this link instead kind of thing. So that's

121
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
a way around these stale IPFS sites if
you're releasing an application on the

122
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
web, or at least that's a trick that I
found. I don't like that it's attached to

123
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
my wallet, but that doesn't stop somebody
from taking the HTML, making their own

124
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
editing, attaching it to their wallet or
some smart contract where a collective of

125
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
people will update a token for the
updates. So it's possibly endless there as

126
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
far as that goes.

127
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And the last thing that I popped on there
was - And this is something that I've

128
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
spoken about for a long time in Ergo back
in the day, was a way to send messages

129
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
back and forth to people individually. I
know HQ spent a lot of time making a

130
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
messaging board, which is really cool
where you have chats that fly back and

131
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
forth, but this is more of a direct send
to somebody. So you can come to this site,

132
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
you can connect your Nautilus wallet, you
can scan for messages. You can scan deep

133
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
for messages too if you want to. If you
want to see all your messages or your

134
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
historical, you can scan a custom range
for messages as well.

135
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And the way it works is you put in the
recipient address a message you can

136
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
encrypt with a passcode. So essentially we
can do a 22 or a 10 character passcode.

137
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And this just uses an encryption method
with that passcode and salt to encrypt it

138
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
on chain so that nobody can read your
message while it's there. And then I would

139
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
essentially find a way to, like, if I have
a communication with HQ, I'd say, hey, HQ,

140
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
our communication is, HQ is a big sexy
beast. It's my 22-character password. So I

141
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
know that every time HQ sends me a
message, I decrypt it with, HQ is a very

142
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
big sexy beast. There's ways that we can
do auto-decryption, but that involves a

143
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
little bit of revealing from the Nautilus
wallet onto there. And I think it's safer

144
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
this way, and it would require Captain
Nemo to do some tweaks on his end for

145
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
exposing decryption from the Nautilus
wallet.

146
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So that's that. You fill that in. You
fill out a message lifetime, essentially,

147
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
of how long you want this message to last
for, up to 365 days, which is one erg, and

148
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
then it scales backwards in time exactly.
So two hours is 0.01 erg for the fee. And

149
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
that's it. You enter the recipient. You
hit Enter. And it builds a transaction.

150
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You send it. And then after two hours, you
can come here to scan. And then anybody,

151
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and originally I was going to make this
just for miners to do, but anybody can

152
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
come to this site, fair game if they get
to it first, and can build a transaction

153
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
to burn. And then that message is now
burnt off the blockchain to be cleaned up

154
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
with some incentive to do it. So right
now, in 3.8 days, somebody has sent a

155
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
message. It's going to be burnt for 0.03
ergs they can burn it for and collect

156
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
whatever that 0.2 is after the transaction
fee.

157
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So that's up and that's out of my hands.
The HTML can be downloaded and looked at

158
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and rebuilt and taken somewhere else and
reformed. It doesn't matter. They're all

159
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
out there. And that's how easy, I think,
vibe coding connecting to Ergo is, right?

160
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It was able to read the Nautilus SDK
libraries, the Ergo mobile libraries. It

161
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
was able to embed Wasm into the, at least
the site app that I used, which makes it a

162
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
little large, and all be self-contained so
that you could just upload one HTML file.

163
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The site and the say are like four
megabytes for an HTML file. The Enfermo

164
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
messaging is like 400k, or maybe it's like
200k. It's extremely small, because I only

165
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
have Nautilus integrated into it. But
yeah, yeah. So that's me, guys. That's

166
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
what I've been banging out, just trying to
make some kind of unstoppable apps that

167
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
could be done quickly, vibe-coded, and
thrown on IPFS. What about you guys?

168
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Well, I have a new feature for you to
add.

169
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Let's hear it, sir.

170
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So for a formal message, instead of using
the passcode, you could use the sender

171
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
private PK. So right. So if there is
message for someone, they can see that

172
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
there is message, but they have to sign a
TX and provide their private key. And when

173
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
they provide their private key, it matches
with the message. the token you have

174
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
minted. So that's how they can see the
message.

175
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah, so the issue there, I think, from
when I was coding is that, first of all,

176
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
the person has to have done a transaction
on chain, right? But in that case, they're

177
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
only putting their public key up on chain
for that transaction or something like

178
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
that. There was some issue from what I
tried to understand that Nautilus can't

179
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
expose enough during the signing
transaction. And the person sending the

180
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
message doesn't know enough about the
receiver to be able to encode something

181
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
that the person could then prove against
and sign kind of thing when you're doing

182
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
the initial encryption by the sender. So
that was what I ran into and how I

183
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
understood it. Maybe, kushti, do you
understand this better, HQ?

184
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yeah, I think there are pleat options for
it. I think it's go to address and I go

185
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
address to PK, which can be used to
convert because you are already providing

186
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
the sender address. So it can convert that
into the, into the PK, which will instead

187
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
of using the address, and then you can
just extract and mismatch matching between

188
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
the boxes or in your case, you are just
doing with tokens. So instead of ending

189
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
the description of the token, there will
be instead of address, there will be the

190
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
public PK of that address and that user
has to validate somehow. So that would be

191
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
one way to doing it, but yeah, I like the
way you do it. It's the more simpler way.

192
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah, it's simpler. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And
then I'll look into that again. I'll take

193
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
another stab at it, that's for sure. We'll
see what we can do. What about you, HQ?

194
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What's the recent thing besides the
Android app that you built? So we're

195
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
talking with AI, right? Yeah, yeah, AI,
yeah.

196
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So the last thing, I think the cart. 50%
of the cart, the front end was done with

197
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
AI. The back end logic for chain
transaction and everything was done

198
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
written manually, but most of the front
end stuff was done with AI.

199
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
For what, which app?

200
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
At MuMart, we have included a new feature
where you can bulk list and you can bulk

201
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
buy. Right, right. So there is a shopping
cart you can go and, and actually I forgot

202
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
to mention you that there is another
option on Mart. So instead of check mark,

203
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
you can just drag and drop those NFTs.

204
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Let's show people. Where is it? MuMart,
NFTMart? MuFinance, yeah. So if we go here

205
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:44,000
and we look at these, we can click on,
where's the button that we can multiple

206
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:53,000
select there? Where'd you go, HQ?

207
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
In the bottom corner, you will see a blue
button. Just click on that. And then you

208
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
can just drag any of those NFTs into the
cart.

209
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Not coming up for me. I see a yellow plus
button at the bottom, mart.mufinance.com.

210
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You have to go to your slash explore, not
on the main screen.

211
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
OK, slash explore. OK, perfect. Yep, yep,
yep. So we click that. We check a bunch of

212
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
boxes. All right, now we're showing people
here. So if we want to buy those three,

213
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
then we go to our cart. Look at that.
That's so cute. And then it pops over on

214
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
the right, insufficient balance. Oh, no, I
don't have enough. I don't have enough

215
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
CYPX for these. And then, oh, you even do
buy more on your DEX. Then buy five

216
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
orders. So it's going to do five
transactions, right, if that's what you

217
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
had said before? But that's just how UTXO
and the smart contract works right for

218
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
that. So yeah. So instead of having to
click, refresh, go back, do the thing, you

219
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
can load them all up in the cart, hit buy,
sign a couple transactions, and be done.

220
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That seems very convenient, sir.

221
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah, and instead of clicking on check
marking them, if you just like press the

222
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
NFT and drag the NFT to the shopping cart,
it will also add it to your cart.

223
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Let's see. Oh, look at that, sir. Look at
that. Isn't that cute? Super cute. Nice

224
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
job, HQ.

225
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's 60 lines of code just for people
so they don't have to select.

226
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
When I code, I code very simple scripts.
I code in Perl, I code in HTML and

227
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
JavaScript, but we're talking like that
10,000 lines of code was absolutely

228
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
stupid, ridiculous. Most of them are like
500, 600 lines per script. If I get up to

229
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
1,000 or 2,000, that's a little too much
to take control in my liking. I want

230
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
something that's like 10 kilobytes. I want
it to load immediately because we're

231
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
dealing with IPFS as well. So I wanted to
come across the meeting. So I don't

232
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
usually run into an issue where I'm AI
coding, and I can't get something fixed,

233
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
or I run out of tokens fast. I know I'm on
the pro plan for Claude and ChatGPT Pro,

234
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
but I don't run into that issue ever. But
I hear people who have these big Node.js

235
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
sites with 30, 40 files in it can run out
pretty fast when they're trying to debug.

236
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
How do you guys do that when you're
running these bigger applications and more

237
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
complex things?

238
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Doing what? Sorry.

239
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So when I program, I'm writing small
scripts. My code is under 1,000 lines.

240
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's very easy. I don't run out of tokens.
It's very easy for Claude to ingest and

241
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
work on it. But when I hear about other
people running big Node.js apps or these

242
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
large applications, running out of tokens
or getting in a spot where there's just

243
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
too much for the AI to tokenize and bring
in, how do you guys get around that when

244
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
you're doing it? Or are you just focusing
on small things as well?

245
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So usually you need to do specs all the
time and work through specs with an agent

246
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:23,000
like QuantCode, for example. So, actually,
bro etiquette has a lot of experience here

247
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and he is working in particular on Git
circles. Using that approach, so first you

248
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:41,000
do a spec, right? Well, also, mostly with
an agent. And then using the spec, you are

249
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:50,000
working piece by piece on some specific
part of software. And so, yeah, by doing

250
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:59,000
that, you are managing the context window,
right, because, well, if too much things

251
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:08,000
there in context windows, so you are
getting worse results in code generation.

252
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And Fitz, what is your experience? Are you
playing with basis tracker or with testing

253
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:26,000
scripts for basis?

254
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yeah, I have been. It's been pretty fun,
actually. I kind of remember a quote that

255
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
you said about taking over Ergo as much as
possible, and it kind of gives me this

256
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
feeling. So I've just been using Cloud
Code. I don't have extensive coding

257
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
experience. But yeah, I think the spec is
right. I mean, you've got to get it. For

258
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
me, personally, I just got to get it. It
has to know what it's aiming for. And

259
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
definitely, the prompt has to be, you have
to have a well-defined prompt. But it was

260
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
pretty easy, honestly, to get the basis
and do a test, like a Alice, Carol, Bob

261
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
type test. And it ran it for me. I'd just
been doing that for the last day or so.

262
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Honestly, it's been a lot of fun. And I
think it gets me thinking about a lot of

263
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
other things I could do with Ergo.

264
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
So some other things I did that we can do
as well. Sorry, I don't mean to jump on

265
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
the horn again, but I forgot to say it. So
this is something that was Vibe-coded for

266
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
the SigmaNuts mining pool, right?
Essentially, I took an old app I had for

267
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
the mining pool, a very simple one, and
gave it all the APIs of mining core,

268
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
everything else, and told it to have at
it, make it look nice, make it look

269
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
functional. And it actually did a pretty
amazing job doing what it needs to do

270
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
there, showing all miners. We can go to
this miner. We can select a certain C. We

271
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
can see their payouts, all that kind of
stuff.

272
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But one thing, too, that I wanted to
mention, the main reason I brought this up

273
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
is because then I did this. I said, guys,
we had a server go down, right? And I

274
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
said, guys, why don't we do this? So I
took right here, I took my file in my

275
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
repo. I'd like to fully host this on IPFS.
Is it possible to convert fully to HTML

276
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
JavaScript instead of HTML JavaScript
Perl? There we go. It explores it, does

277
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
it, creates it, does some changes. There
was an issue with one of the

278
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
click-throughs. And then there was another
issue with something else for a minor.

279
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
They did some changes. Boom. That's it.
And then it gave me an HTML file in my

280
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
GitHub that I could then throw up on IPFS
and hand to the miners, and they could

281
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
have it run serverless without that. So
that's some other cool stuff that I think

282
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
AI can do for you. Save you a ton of time
if you want to go from one platform to

283
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
another platform. I know I just went from
HTML JavaScript Perl to HTML JavaScript.

284
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
But still, that opened up the window to be
able to host it somewhere else fully. And

285
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
as you can see from Claude, it literally
took 10 minutes to convert an entire

286
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
working app to that kind of thing. So
that's a cool use case, too, that I've

287
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
found.

288
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Yeah. And I know this might sound
non-trivial, but I honestly had a hard

289
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
time setting up a node and doing
interactions with the node. Now I just

290
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
feel like I can vibe code whatever I'd
like for the most part. I mean, of course,

291
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
there's constraints I have to go through,
but it definitely feels like an entry

292
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
barrier has been decreased. So you can
actually have fun.

293
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, once Claude
understands the node endpoints, I mean,

294
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
it's like game over, right? You show it
what the endpoints are, what it produces,

295
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
and it does more than you could remember
to do at that point.

296
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Exactly, yeah.

297
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I had an issue with the Explorer running
on peer-to-peer machines, which are 32

298
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
gigs of RAM and one terabyte hard drive.
There's some massive queries that HQ and

299
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
ACO keep throwing at me that some of them
can't do. So with Claude and ChatGPT,

300
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
putting them in there, letting them watch
the terminal, and seeing the outputs or

301
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
pasting in the outputs of certain things,
it allowed me to do something that I've

302
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
never done before, which is to identify
where the SQL commands are coming in, the

303
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Postgres commands are coming in, what
they're getting stuck on, what it's

304
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
hanging on, and then giving me the codes
to actually build a freaking index to

305
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
account for those large queries. And so
far, we've got three new indexes that

306
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
we've built on peer-to-peer, the
peer-to-peer infra that is still, I think,

307
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I haven't checked the status, but I know
that a couple of people have installed

308
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
them on their machines already. But that
would have been impossible without AI. I

309
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
mean, absolutely impossible. We'd have to
find somebody like, what's his name,

310
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Boris, who hardly answers his DMs to help
us out with that since he's kind of an

311
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
expert in that field. But yeah, with AI,
it's done in half an hour and tested and

312
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
deployed.

313
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yeah, and we are discussing a lot these
days in the developers' chat how to use

314
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
LLMs to improve things here and there. So
in particular, it seems... So I've used

315
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,000
LLMs to verify user contracts before
deployment and yeah, it's working well.

316
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Actually, if you manage contracts
properly, so we had some discussions with

317
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Rob. As a result, and yeah, I think we can
actually release some files with a

318
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,000
description of, well, popular problems
developers, well, mistakes developers are

319
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,000
doing in scripts and then, yeah, well,
they can be efficiently verified. So it's

320
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,000
much simpler than with EVM contracts and
so on. Because yeah, here is the approach

321
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
is simple and verification is also quite
simple and manageable for LLMs. So, yeah,

322
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,000
well, audit also can be done.

323
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Right, so you've spoken for quite a while
now, kushti, of saying that you're running

324
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
iterated tests via AI. You're figuring out
ways to test your code or at least

325
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
security test your code some ways with
LLMs?

326
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Yeah, so for our contracts, it's possible
to find some issues, at least because

327
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:38,000
usually it's about two or three vectors.
Usually all the issues known to the moment

328
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:46,000
can be categorized. Well, in a very simple
way. So usually it's about the developer

329
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:54,000
forgetting to check some register.
Correspondence from inputs or outputs,

330
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:02,000
right? just basically a human mistake,
quite trivial for LLM to detect and

331
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:10,000
report. And then another issue is, well,
possibility to spend two inputs with one

332
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,000
output, right, when it's not planned. That
was found in production in some Cardano

333
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:26,000
applications in Ergo. That wasn't
exploited or publicly reported, but yeah,

334
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:34,000
that's quite a popular issue and stated
even in the ErgoScript white paper. And

335
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,000
yeah, it's also quite easy for LLM to
figure out this kind of mistake made by

336
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,000
developer.

337
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And then for testing, for doing off-chain
tests like Amitabh did a lot for Dexy and

338
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:11,000
so on. Yeah, that's also much easier,
quite trivial to do with. So this day, so

339
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I did some tests for chain cash contracts
basically for free. Yeah, for four basis

340
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:27,000
also. There are some contributors like
Arcadia doing now some tests with LLMs

341
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:35,000
probably without scala knowledge even,
right? So, well, LLMs is just mutating

342
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:43,000
test factors. And yeah, that's also quite
helpful. So before a few years ago, we

343
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:51,000
spent many days for doing such mutations
manually. Then, yeah, well, with tests for

344
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,000
contracts, you can find also some issues,
right, when you're developing contracts.

345
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And then, yeah, for the node itself, so
got better testing coverage. And, yeah,

346
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:15,000
for Sigma interpreter also with LLMs. So
they're working quite well when you

347
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:23,000
already have vast testing code base. So
when you have like 300 tests, it's quite

348
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:31,000
trivial to derive another one, right? So
yeah, that's where LLMs are working

349
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:39,000
perfectly.

350
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And while you're talking, kushti, I'm
just going through all the stuff on

351
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Degen's world that he's built so far,
that's accompanying your voice. Pretty

352
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
neat stuff.

353
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Yeah, then developing some trivial
contracts, right? Like, well, from a

354
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
coding point of view, probably ErgoScript
is not quite complex, right? But then you

355
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
need to develop off-chain part and with
LLMs it's now trivial because well, it's

356
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
also quite simpletizable, quite
straightforward to generate after studying

357
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
existing examples.

358
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Well, I would like to shout out our two
new devs we have, thanks to the vibe

359
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
coding. So we have Michael, who is vibe
coding, and also we have CannonQ, who's

360
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
working on some stuff.

361
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh, right. Yeah, so Bro Etiquette,
Arcadia, and more, yeah.

362
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Well, you guys are chatting. Let me go to
development and try to find CannonQ's

363
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
site. What's it called, HQ?

364
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I think he did. It's cyberverse.app.
Yeah, but I think if you go to new dev, I

365
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
think there is this link for it.

366
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yeah, but I thought CannonQ had a name
for it. It's like Wallet History or

367
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
something like that. No.

368
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I think he built two different things. He
built that one thing for cyberverse,

369
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
another thing was for the Wallet History.

370
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
OK, here's Cyberverse Viewer. Let me put
that up. Let's see how that looks,

371
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
everybody. So he built this. Oh, that's a
fast load. He's slow. Nice. Very cool.

372
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yeah, so he's got Cyberverse Viewer here.
Very cool. Do you know if he's using the

373
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
CDN from Auction House that this stuff
loads nicely?

374
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
No, I think he has the map. Oh,
fantastic.

375
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah, because it is fast loading. That's
really awesome. Dang. Amazing. Who else?

376
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Who does the Cyberverse Wiki, right?
Doesn't somebody else?

377
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Leximon, but he, I think, is not with us
anymore, at least in the chats.

378
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
OK. All right, so this is a kind of at
least take up from that. But this is

379
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
awesome, yeah. And then CannonQ also built
the kind of tax collector stuff, where you

380
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
can put in a range of time. And
essentially, it tells you what your tokens

381
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
and Ergo have done in that amount of time
kind of thing. So that's a pretty neat

382
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
feature as well. Nothing like trying to
murder all the nodes and stuff.

383
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Oh, and I forgot about this, guys.

384
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Yes. So it's becoming...

385
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I have a question. So talking about AI
agents, is there any way we can have AI

386
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:52,000
agent on chain which can execute stuff
based on logic? You just provide them?

387
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Yeah, but what does it mean on-chain?

388
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I mean that the AI agent is on-chain. For
example, it's a smart contract on-chain

389
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
where you send something like maybe a
signal of something and the bot, instead

390
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
of the smart contract logic, it also runs
the AI logic to it. I know it's a super

391
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
solution.

392
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Yeah, but that's AI logic is off chain,
right? So usually it's when people are

393
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:31,000
talking about AI on chain. So usually it's
about some trusted gateway to trusted. I

394
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:39,000
don't write.

395
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
So I'm clicking through on the screen.
You guys can't see it on Zoom. But the

396
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Simple Explorer that I built with ChatGPT,
maybe like eight months ago. And then I

397
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
just recently revamped it with Claude a
little bit to make it a little better. And

398
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
it uses, what's it called? It uses the CDN
from Auction House to find NFTs that

399
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
they're holding and caching. So at least
for now, NFT should load fairly fast. And

400
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I was going to look at, let's see, I was
going to try to show you an example of

401
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
that. Let's look for that.

402
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So you can just type in a wallet, or an
address, or a token ID, or a transaction

403
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
ID, just like ErgExplorer, and it knows
which one it is and lists it. So let's

404
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
take an old NFT that we probably know
shouldn't be anywhere like Cyberverse

405
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
1129. Boom, there, it loads perfectly
well. And it loads from Ergo Auction House

406
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
content delivery network, as opposed to
the IPFS. Yeah, this one doesn't look like

407
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
it, so it's going to try IPFS, and it's
probably been too long to where it's been

408
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
un-pinned from an IPFS site. So some of
them will not load, ever, unless they're

409
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
re-pinned somehow. Oh, it's a kushti
Cyberverse skin. Look at that, kushti.

410
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
That's one of my favorites. Did you know
you're on Cyberverse? You have an Ergo

411
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
piece of armor on, kushti?

412
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Uh, no, I don't know.

413
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
For all the stuff I have done for
Cybervese when I'm not even in the museum.

414
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
No, I know the museum's a little old,
right? When the game was open, I went to

415
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
the museum and I was standing with a
chilling friend. And I was like, okay,

416
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
he's here and I'm not here.

417
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Do we know if Heroes used any AI? I wish
Heroes was here. It'd be nice if Heroes

418
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
watching. Please hop in. But what's it
called? I remember my password. It'd be

419
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
amazing if... Sorry, I can't hear myself
because I just opened up Cyberverse and

420
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,000
it's blasting. It's blasting in my ear.
Let me mute it. OK. It'd be amazing if

421
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Hiro would let us know how much AI is
involved in his game creation now, right?

422
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Because they just actually, and for those
of you on Zoom that can't see this, I'm in

423
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Cyberverse right now streaming on the
right-hand side. They integrated the betas

424
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,000
up for the early people that can hop in
and test. And Pixel gave me access to it.

425
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And this is a new section right here for
combat. Let me see. I'll go in real

426
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,000
quickly, and I will enter this part and
get the crap kicked out of me by some

427
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
squirrely guy. Yep. Yeah. Oh, boy. Yeah,
I'm going to run away. So I'd love to see.

428
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Hiro, if you're watching this at some
point, or Mr. Pixel, if you could comment

429
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
or tell us exactly how much AI is involved
in any of your coding. I know probably not

430
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
with the artwork, right? You guys are
painstakingly hand-drawing all the

431
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
artwork. But with integration or anything
like that, how are you guys embracing AI?

432
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
That would be neat to know. Do you guys
know? You guys hear anything, HQ?

433
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,000
No, I have never talked about development
side of Cyberverse.

434
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah, that's that. Very
cool. We'll leave that up. That's a good

435
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
picture to have. It's such a beautiful
game. What else, guys? We got some class.

436
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Yeah, go for it, kushti.

437
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Yeah, so now it's easier and easier to
develop applications, right, on-chain

438
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:50,000
applications. So then it's changing, well,
economics of the process, right? So, well,

439
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:58,000
no need in most cases now to issue those
stupid tokens, like DEV tokens, right?

440
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Because, well, it's becoming easier and
easier to do all that stuff. But yeah, I

441
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:14,000
mean, people are creating millions of meme
coins anyway, so those dev tokens are also

442
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:22,000
probably going to this category quite
soon. But if we are talking about some

443
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:30,000
serious applications useful for the real
world, then probably we need to think

444
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:38,000
about economic implications and how to
build economies around those imagined

445
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:46,000
possibilities.

446
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Right, you said something on Twitter the
other day, kushti, that says, if there's

447
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
100 times more developers being able to
code on blockchains, then the only thing

448
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
that stands out among blockchains now is
the fundamentals of the blockchain, or

449
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
something like that. What was your quote?
Do you remember what that was?

450
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Right, yeah, so ideas and yeah, they
soundness, right? So you need for solid

451
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:20,000
ideas and you need to be focused right on
principles. So solid foundations and

452
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:28,000
principles and well, the ideas should be
sound economically and monetary wise,

453
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:36,000
right? Because after all, the whole space
is mostly about money, right? Doing money

454
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:44,000
while optimistically producing better
forms of money than we have today. So

455
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:52,000
yeah, that's what does matter and well,
doing token for Web3 somewhat application

456
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:00,000
just because you want to dump this token
on others.

457
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Yeah, it's... Wasn't there a dump of the
New York City token the other day or

458
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
whatever that was of Mayor Eric Adams? I
didn't get to the bottom of it to see how

459
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
legitimate it was, but

460
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:22,000
But that's about meme, right? There are a
lot of dev tokens and I think for them

461
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:31,000
there is need to consider well, soundness
also, right?

462
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Yeah, but I think we're going to see at
some point with the people's ability to

463
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
make these. I mean, you can spin up a pump
fun site or something like that in a

464
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
matter of minutes now, right? So you might
see more deployment of those kind of

465
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
things at some point. Once the people
hungry for rugs and meme coins start doing

466
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
that more, you're going to see more shit
like that, I imagine. Maybe more hacks as

467
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
well. I mean, I can, I'd be afraid to, I'd
be afraid to vibe code on Ethereum

468
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
network. I don't know. Sorry. Go HQ.

469
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I have a, let's say, I'm not sure if a EF
will be able to handle any Ergo hack this

470
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
year because of knowing the funds they
have remaining. So now that we are talking

471
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
about AI and what do you guys think if on
the main Ergo platform and GitHub, we just

472
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
create another branch with multiple
languages, let's say with SVELTE, Node.js

473
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and different frameworks with projects,
simple projects with MD files with how to

474
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
sign transactions, how this works, how to
do that and create a simple hackathon

475
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
based on AI. So people have to build a
simple app using the frameworks which are

476
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
already there. So there is a base which
has wallet connection and everything, but

477
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
they have to build on top of it. So maybe
it would be nice to have a small kind of

478
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
hackathon for AI based stuff so people can
build stuff and it doesn't need to be a

479
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
bigger price for it. So maybe a small
price for all the people who participate

480
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
and see how people actually use AI and how
what apps can be built. So if outcome of

481
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
that, there is one app which is liked by
many community. So we could just grab that

482
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
app and make it more decentralized and
make it much cleaner. So having some

483
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
templates up with some readme.md with all
how transaction works and all that would

484
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
be easier for all the vibe coders which
are looking for blockchains one way to

485
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
develop on.

486
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
No, I agree, HQ. I think it would have
been because I have to essentially harvest

487
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
code every time I want to teach Claude how
to do a wallet connection or how to do

488
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
that. So it would be amazing if I could
just point him to a repo that's been tried

489
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and tested and fixed that says, hey,
here's how we connect in JS. Here's how we

490
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
connect in Perl. Here's how we connect in
Swift. Here's how all this works kind of

491
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
thing.

492
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Just have four different frameworks.
Let's say, then we have a simple HTML.

493
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
There are people who would like to build
on HTML. You have built on HTML and using

494
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Fleet. So yeah, so just have a simpler
templates there for them so people can

495
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
just fork them and work on it. And then
you see all the activity it can bring on

496
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
chain also in all the development for the
new people who are interested in these

497
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
kind of things.

498
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Yeah, but definitely save tokens and
time, that's for sure.

499
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Yeah. Yeah, and so for AI-focused
hackathon, actually, we had one in

500
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,000
December. So that was unstoppable
hackathon in Jaipur. And so, yeah, there

501
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,000
were some Ergo-related applications, such
as updated visual coding tool. And more,

502
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:06,000
so me and Bruno are still, well, messing
with doing previous bit because, well,

503
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,000
most of applications were, well, vibe
coded again by students, right? And yeah,

504
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:20,000
well, a lot of them. And also, well, many
repositories are now full of vibe coded

505
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:27,000
pull requests, but yeah, usually it's low
quality slop there, but there are about

506
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:34,000
100 pull requests created in all the
repositories according to CannonQ. And

507
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:41,000
yeah, well, I've reviewed only like three
of them and two reviewed by Dusik to the

508
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:48,000
moment. So yeah, well, it's another side,
right? So it's cheap to produce code, but

509
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:55,000
well, if you're talking about core
repositories, then yeah, usually we need

510
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:02,000
higher quality than LLMs are capable.

511
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Then for core repositories we now have
the interpreter and also the node

512
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:25,000
repositories. The code there now contains
agents.md file which is prohibiting to use

513
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:34,000
AI agents in main codes, non-testing. So,
well, agents may produce tests only

514
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:43,000
according to those rules for agents. But
yes, such rules are respected by some

515
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:52,000
tooling like Claude code, Quen code, Krush
and so on. But not all the tools even

516
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:01,000
respect those rules. So yeah, it's quite a
dynamic landscape, right? And yeah, so for

517
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:10,000
hackathons, I think, well, it's maybe
better to do, well, hackathons with

518
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:19,000
external partners, like unstoppable,
right? So that was quite an exciting

519
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:28,000
experience. Yeah, we've got hundreds of
students now, well, having some idea about

520
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Ergo Blockchain. That's quite nice.

521
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Oh, I got a question for all of you guys,
the vibe code. So imagine you run, you

522
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
know, you're in control of several repos,
right, with complex code. Now, I was

523
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
reading an article, not an article, a post
on Reddit maybe a couple of weeks ago

524
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
about somebody who's a maintainer of a
project that's on there that's somewhat

525
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
popular. And he said that the most
annoying thing that he sees is when, now

526
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
that there's a vibe coding around, that
there are so many pull requests with just

527
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,000
script kiddies or whatever, people don't
understand code, just putting it into AI

528
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
and recommending changes on the code or
feature additions and that kind of thing.

529
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And he said he finds that his time is so
much more taken up with either ignoring

530
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
these things or actually seeing if they'll
work and that kind of thing, as opposed to

531
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
somebody who knows what they're doing and
knows how to really suggest changes in

532
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
PRs. What are your thoughts on that and
how busy that could become for a

533
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
maintainer of a project?

534
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Yeah, that's true. So that's quite
challenging, right? So yeah, we also have

535
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:03,000
people coming with vibe coded pull
requests for the nodes or Sigma state

536
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:11,000
interpreter. And yeah, usually, well, it's
just slop, right? So quality is terrible

537
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:19,000
and the pull requests are not achieving
goals specified simply.

538
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, even before that,
though, I mean, you'd have people submit

539
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
pull requests that weren't great and
hardly had to be checked kind of thing.

540
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Even just with the language translations
we had to deal with, there were some

541
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
things there with that massive amount of
files, yeah, file that you had to go

542
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
through. But yeah. Yeah, I get it. Well,
HQ had to leave us. Let me check and see

543
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
if there's any questions that are besides
price talk in the chat.

544
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Byron wants to know when Gluon is,
kushti. Let's see, anything else? Somebody

545
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
mentioned Deco? Yeah, we love Deco. Ergo
the Argonian commented on Deco, how it

546
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
hasn't been around for a bit. But that was
fantastic, listening to the Cheese and

547
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
LGD. Some of the videos are still out
there, guys, and LGD's been around a long

548
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
time. He's been on a couple videos lately
even. There's a video from the Meetup

549
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
where he explains Gluon. I think he also
has another presentation that he did for

550
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Gluon recently, even after the Ergo
Meetup. So they're still around with that

551
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
kind of stuff, which is great.

552
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:39,000
You know what I'd love to do? You know
what I built for? Let me see if I can get

553
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:47,000
this up for you guys. I would love to be
able to get Cheese and LGD's voice, and

554
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:55,000
also Marty, those three, those
combinations. And I would love to do this.

555
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So I built this based on ChatterTTS. It's
a Python PyTorch library that runs on a

556
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
machine with two 3090s right here next to
me, actually, in Iraq. So you take a

557
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
reference voice right here and you put in
a bunch of text, and it generates a pretty

558
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
darn accurate output of that person's
voice. So it would be amazing if maybe we

559
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
could fundraise and get LGD or Cheese to
be able to take text-based tutorials, and

560
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000
we could make AI content out of them with
their voice kind of thing in that theme of

561
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Deco. I know some people might think
that's a little creepy, but we're actually

562
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
using this here on the campus for a
specific medical reason that we're testing

563
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000
out and on. And it seems to work really
well for people with speech difficulties.

564
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
But there are other opportunities as well.
Somebody wrote me after I released it and

565
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
says, hey, I do these tutorials online.
And I can't get through two seconds of

566
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
this thing or or, so I'd love to be able
to just use this kind of tool. So I'd love

567
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
to use this for DECO, you know, take tech
space, put the familiar voices of cheese

568
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
and LGD on there and go from there. Even
kushti, we could take your voice.

569
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And the really cool thing about this as
well is we can convert them to different

570
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
languages too. So we can do multilingual
here, and we can choose different

571
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
languages. We can switch to Russian. If we
paste Russian text in here, it'll take my

572
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,000
voice and speak Russian. It'll take
kushti's voice and speak English or that

573
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
kind of thing. So I think that would be a
really cool tool for blending with Deco or

574
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
whatever that is. Just my two cents there
boys.

575
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Well, in the developer's chat, there is a
guy, x10zyn, who is doing a Sigma book.

576
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:08,000
He's going through a few repositories and
documentation and creating a book on how

577
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:18,000
ErgoScript is working under the hood, the
Sigma layer. And yeah, it's actually in

578
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:28,000
some parts quite beautiful. And he is,
well, analyzing with agents the code in

579
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:38,000
scala, mostly rust also, and generating
snippets for his book in Zic language. So

580
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:48,000
you can translate, well, not in human
languages, but also in computer languages

581
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:58,000
also. So yeah, that's great. And well,
going back to, well, 100x more developers

582
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:08,000
and ideas, I think we need to revive work
on Ergo book, right? So well, to outline

583
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:18,000
the path, how to get better money for the
real-world needs. From those ideas, people

584
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:28,000
can work with AI agents also, with or
without AI agents that they can develop

585
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:38,000
from the, well, ideas from the Ergo book.
So I need to ping, guys working on that,

586
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:48,000
so Joe, Greyman, and yeah, I'm also
inviting Martin, so yeah.

587
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Very cool. And Grayman's already written
a couple chapters.

588
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:13,000
He has written some pieces on silver and
history of US monetary system, including

589
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:25,000
pre-fed era. So yeah, quite interesting.

590
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Very cool. All right, guys, well, five
minutes over. I think kushti, you're

591
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
interested in the spaces next time? Was
that your proposal?

592
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I don't know. So let's do maybe chain
cache basis-related spaces. How about that

593
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,000
next Thursday then?

594
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I'm down. That sounds fun.

595
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
All right. That sounds good, guys. So
stay tuned for Spaces on Chain Cache

596
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
featuring Fitz and kushti.

597
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Yeah, we will invite more guys, so Joe
maybe, and so on.

598
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Perfect. Awesome. All right, guys, thanks
for joining. Don't be afraid to speak up

599
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
in the developer chat. Even if you're vibe
coding, nobody shames there. Don't feel

600
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
embarrassed to do that. Everybody's
learning, and everybody's welcome, that's

601
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
for sure. Thanks so much, Fitz, kushti,
and HQ for joining today.

602
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Thank you very much. And thank you guys
for the patience, too. Like you said, the

603
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
vibe coding, actually, it's been - It's
been like I haven't got any judgment. So

604
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,000
it's been awesome just to build. So yeah,
it's been a pleasure, too.

605
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Amazing. All right. Thanks, guys. Ciao.
Take it easy, everybody.

606
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Yeah. Thank you, everyone. Bye.

607
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Keep in touch.
