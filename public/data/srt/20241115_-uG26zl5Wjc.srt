00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hello and welcome to the weekly Ergo AMA.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Today with me, we have, wait, what's your
name? I forgot.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hey guys, I'm MGPai. Super excited to be
on again.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
MGPai, aren't you that guy that was
working on Ergo names?

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How's that going?

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's such an intricate project. I bet.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We're just busting it right off the bat.
What's new? What's new?

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I've been trying to get some work in for
Ergo names. I definitely want to finish it

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
off. I just been really busy with school.
We just had midterm midterms and all. So

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
we have Thanksgiving coming up in the US
in about a week and a half. So hoping to

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
use that time to get more involved again
in Ergo names, but we have Thanksgiving

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and Christmas. So I'm pretty confident I
can finish it then because all our smart

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
contracts are done. It's just off chain
stuff, getting the contracts to run

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
itself. And that's all already has
progress on it. So hopefully we can have

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that going.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So it'll be a nice little Christmas
present you're saying.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's my hope.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Fantastic. Fantastic. What else is new?
How's Palmyra? How's ZenGate? How's all

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
that cross-chain business going with
commodities and trading of them?

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, it's going pretty well. A lot of
progress. We keep onboarding new

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
developers and scaling, because there's
just so much work to be done and so many

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
opportunities to seize with RWAs. It's
quite popular, especially in this new

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
cycle right. A lot of people are realizing
that RWAs are really the path for real

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
world utility and involvement rather than
just NFTs itself right. Something a little

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
more beneficial so yeah, a lot of progress
is being done. I think the community will

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
be really happy. Again, I don't know how
much I can say, it's not my control so

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll just leave it at that.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You're not gonna pull a Tom Holland and
give away everything after me. That's

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
right, that can be pretty scary can it?
Dan's probably no, he sees a wake. I'm

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
sure right now. It's pretty early over
there. Nice nice. Well, what do you think

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
of the... are we in a bull?

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh yeah, it's pretty cool to see Bitcoin
go across 90k, right? Again, it's always

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
kind of weird though, right? From like
2022 or 2021, where alts were also

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
pumping. It's really just Bitcoin. Little
liquidity, I guess, started to flow into

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
altcoins, but it's still not significant,
which is very surprising. Hopefully, we'll

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
see at least something, right? When
Bitcoin crossed its original all-time high

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
from 2020, it was still pretty, it was
very stagnant the altcoins, but now at

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
least we are seeing something like 10%
20%. So yeah, so maybe it's the small

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
spark to something.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
10% 20% on what?

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Like across most altcoins.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, well, I would say Ergo's performing
quite a bit better than that. Yes. Yeah,

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
but on average I would say probably that
yeah. Yeah, so it'll be interesting to see

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
when that if it's gonna keep on kind of a
trickle in flow or it's gonna be a season

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
again where it just spanks out and you're
like, whoa, there it goes kind of thing.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Exactly. Who knows, but very happy with
the Ergo movement right now coming back to

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
what the price was about a year ago and...

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So hopefully the community can take
advantage of this momentum. I'm very happy

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Rosen is doing that. I've been talking to
Joe a lot about the progress for Rosen. We

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
have Dogecoin coming up and I don't know
if you guys follow the US news, but it

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
seems that Trump has opened a new
department called Department of Government

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
efficiency DOGE. So that's quite
something. So I'm sure Dogecoin will pump

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
in the future.

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah, I think it's up from 11 cents to 30
some cents last time I checked or

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
something. So it's already three times.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Absolutely. But we're gonna take
advantage of that right. We're gonna go to

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
DOGE right and... Again, it's just like
Bitcoin, so people don't have much to do

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
there. So maybe we can convince them to
leverage the Rosen Bridge and do something

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
on other ecosystems with their Dogecoins.
And then we're also getting Binance Smart

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Chain. And now I think you will start to
see more fun. We've been seeing some

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
transfers to Ethereum, but the problem is
it's very expensive. So having on Binance

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Smart Chain allows you for a very similar
environment with high liquidity, but much,

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
much, much cheaper fees.

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And another cool thing I realized is
Alephium has their Binance Smart Chain

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
bridge also coming out. So it might even
be possible to interact with Alephium

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
through each other's chains because I
think they can also bridge native assets.

68
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And since Rosen already bridges native
assets, maybe it's possible to go to

69
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Alephium without using Rosen, using
whatever bridge infrastructure they have,

70
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
since they both connect to Binance Smart
Chain. So that's interesting. I've been

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
talking to some people, but that would be
pretty cool to have working. I think

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
definitely these UTXO blockchains needs to
work closer together, since there's just

73
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
so few of them with less liquidity these
days. So I think that'll be fun to see.

74
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah, and I think once, I don't want to
say more mainstream, but once people get

75
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
used to the fact of crypto isn't just
going to something like Robinhood on your

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
phone and clicking and not having your own
custody of your assets, and they get used

77
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
to that, it's not going to be instant. I
think it's going to be a long time before

78
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
that happens. You'll see, I think you'll
see a big spread out of liquidity across

79
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
these decentralized bridges. That's where
Rosen's goal is. So that's the hope I

80
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
mean.

81
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I think it's good that there are things
like central exchanges around for people

82
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
who want that comfort, but I think in
order for the survival and the

83
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
sustainability and the kind of
unstoppable-ness of crypto, there has to

84
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
be a healthy liquidity and a healthy
amount of things like Uniswap, like those

85
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
kind of decentralized exchanges. Yeah, for
sure. Yeah. Otherwise it's like, no, we

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
don't feel like interacting with you,
MGPai. Sorry. Or we don't like a country

87
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
of origin that this person's from. Nope.
That's it. Bye bye kind of thing. So yeah.

88
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I mean, exchanges certainly already do
that with US citizens. Right.

89
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Right. Yeah. I was trying to, speaking of
that, I was trying to give a little plug

90
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
out for Cyberverse right now. Cyberverse,
as some of you know, are working a lot

91
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
cross-chain. So they've moved to Cardano.
They are now working on the gaming chain,

92
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
trying to get in there. It's called Ronin.
And there's a vote up on the Ronin Discord

93
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
right now. In order to be part of that,
you have to have some Ronin in your Ronin

94
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
wallet and connect it to the Discord, and
then you can vote in Discord kind of

95
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
thing. Discord DAO, I guess. Joe Arminio
likes to call them. So I downloaded the

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Ronin app to support Cyberverse and I
clicked the buy fiat, buy from fiat button

97
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
directly, you know. It's gonna put in my
card and I was like, nah, sorry here in

98
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
the U.S. Womp womp.

99
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yeah, so common.

100
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So I just pinged Dan this morning. I was
like, Dan, can you send me a couple ADA so

101
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
that I can simple swap them over to Ronin
and then vote for those guys? So I suggest

102
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
if any of you guys have heard of
Cyberverse, if you're up for supporting an

103
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
amazing Ergo project that's actually a
really fun game too, it's really simple.

104
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Just download a Ronin wallet, join the
Discord and use Simple Swap to go from ADA

105
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
to Ronin. You can do a very small amount.
You can do like 20 ADA and you'll get a

106
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
handful of Ronin on the other side and
then you can vote for them in the Discord.

107
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I think they're aiming to be in the top
13. And I think they're teetering on that.

108
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So any support here...

109
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah, let's help them out. Yeah.

110
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Would be very, very helpful. Yeah. Oh,
thanks. You have ADA? Of course. He told

111
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
me you didn't. I'm just kidding.

112
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And what was I going to say earlier
about... what were we talking about?

113
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Liquidity. I can't remember. What's new in
the Sigmanauts? We have, if some of you

114
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
have noticed, we found a guy from the
drama a couple of weeks ago. We found a

115
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
guy that came forward and was like, hey,
I'll help you run the account. And that's

116
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
SuperGeometry. He is doing an amazing job
at the Sigmanauts Twitter. So if you guys

117
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
are seeing that and appreciating that,
please interact with that account and talk

118
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
to it. I think he's done a post almost
every day now, good posts, gives

119
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
giveaways, those kind of things. He's also
put up a vote for, I think, 100 ERGs

120
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
giveaway per month, so he can kind of
design these giveaways to get engagement

121
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
on that platform and get people
interacting. So that's really awesome,

122
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
very active. I'm trying to repost as much
as I can from the main account that is

123
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
suitable, but yeah, so that's fun.

124
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We are also in the midst of getting a new
multisig in the Sigmanauts. The issue with

125
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
the current multisig is it's made up of
early members and those early members are

126
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
not always in the ecosystem hanging out.
So when we want to do a transaction it

127
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
takes quite a while. I think this last one
took two weeks and it failed because we

128
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
weren't on the same version of Minotaur.
MGPai that reminds me. Where's Minar? What

129
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
is it? Minar Finance? What's the name of
it?

130
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's Moria.

131
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Moria Finance, where's Moria? Is it ready
for us? Come on. Moria Finance, for those

132
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
that don't know, is a very awesome web
interface for multisig. It's kind of like

133
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
a Cardano roundtable, if you guys have
seen that, but it's very simple. You go

134
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
there, you connect your own wallet, which
is your own part of the multisig, and then

135
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
you put in other wallets and they can go
there, they can connect and sign, and it

136
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
does like a round robin. It lets you know
who's next and that kind of thing. So it's

137
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
a really cool project for, you did for
ErgoHack, two ErgoHacks ago?

138
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, two ErgoHacks ago,
yeah, yeah. I would definitely maybe

139
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
that'll be Easter or something. I think
possible work or Christmas because I need

140
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Nautilus like an updated version of
Nautilus and Nemo has been working on it

141
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and... So I think it should be out pretty
soon. I don't know if you guys have been

142
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
following, but Captain Nemo has been doing
a lot of updates for Nautilus as well.

143
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's really, really good now. Especially
the UI, the transaction history, and now

144
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
even better transaction submissions called
chained transactions. So we're definitely

145
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
getting upgrades and it's preparing for
sub-blocks. They've been doing really good

146
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
work. So I think they've been a bit busy
trying to do my interaction because it's

147
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
very cryptography heavy, which is boring
for anyone. But I think they'll have it.

148
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So Nemo told me that they'll get on it.

149
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The new version will show incoming
transactions that you can then send before

150
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
they're even out of the mempool, right?
You can chain transactions. So something

151
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
can come in and you can be like, oh crap,
I sent it to the wrong one.

152
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's perfect. Yeah. I mean, developers
could always do that, but we need a

153
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
better, we need a good interface so anyone
can do that, right? Exactly. That's the

154
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
challenge.

155
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yep. Yeah, that is neat. So the multisig
we put in a vote to Paideia to have some

156
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
new multisig members that are very active
Sigmanauts. I believe it's Luivatra, CW,

157
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Mark the Shark, Jake the Snake, and
CannonQ. We had CW like just Jake's and

158
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
CannonQ myself. And I think that's at
least seven of us. So once that vote

159
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
passes, it should pass later today, I
believe, unless a big no brigade comes up,

160
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
we'll create the multisig in a little
ceremony with wine and cheese, maybe some

161
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
sausage. And then we'll send one big
transaction from the old multisig to the

162
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
new one.

163
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And then we'll talk about, eventually,
the eventual goal, guys, is that we fully

164
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
rely on Paideia. But as Paideia is just
moving out of beta into non-beta, you

165
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
know, production, it's still, we only hold
maybe a couple thousand ERGs in there just

166
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
to be safe in case something really bad
happens. Like I think in the beta guys we

167
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
had a vote going on and I made the vote
and luckily, I didn't attach any money to

168
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
it as a reason. Well, I guess that
wouldn't have mattered but I made the vote

169
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and it... And Louie didn't use, he used a
greater than sign instead of a greater

170
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
than less than equation. So the vote could
never reach consensus because I set it to,

171
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
oh, that's what I did. I made a vote that
would change the configs to have more of a

172
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
consensus. And Louie wrote us immediately,
he was like, guys, that's going to break

173
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
your DAO. Because you're never gonna be
able to get any money out of it because

174
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
you're never gonna be able to get greater
than a hundred essentially. And so the new

175
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
version that he wrote actually has a
greater than less than there so you can do

176
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
those kind of things and they shouldn't
fail.

177
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But yeah, so we're just being cautious
there. Once we fully trust that, you'll

178
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
see most of our funds flow into Paideia
there for that kind of group management as

179
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
opposed to something happening on Paideia
and if it's more than a couple thousand

180
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
ERGs we need to pay out or a special token
that we have in the treasury then it's up

181
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
to the manual multisig there to say yes
we're seeing the vote and we're going to

182
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
obey the vote and go from there. So yeah
soon, super super exciting. Love Paideia.

183
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I guess we should talk. What's that? It's
awesome. It's awesome that Paideia is out.

184
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I think it's been in development for
almost three years, right? Two and a half,

185
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
three years. So that's a really big
milestone, especially for Luivatra and the

186
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
team behind it.

187
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah. Well, let's talk about real quick
the announcement yesterday about ErgoPad,

188
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
right? Marty is kind of winding down at
least his oversight of ErgoPad and

189
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Coinecta. I believe both IDO platforms on
Cardano and Ergo. And I was talking to you

190
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
last night about it. I think Ergo is...
So, I don't know what the term for is it,

191
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
but we have so many options on how to
non-KYC these kind of token launches that

192
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Paideia, not Paideia, ErgoPad and Coinecta
I imagine have a tough time competing with

193
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
that kind of thing. You can come in, you
can lock your tokens, do some other stuff.

194
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
We're working on SigmaLock with you guys
as well, which you can do it through. It's

195
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
just it's a tough tough call there. So I
feel for Marty, I feel for that. But he

196
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
did offer that right. It's code that he
can let anybody use and keep spinning up.

197
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So if the Sigmanauts want to take it over
and have it there just so people can

198
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
unstake that still don't come around for
six months then that's fine. You know, I

199
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
don't imagine it's too hard to keep that
up. But the tough part is managing all the

200
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
KYC in the back end and doing that. I
imagine that is a thankless hard kind of

201
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
thing to do. That's a very big headache.

202
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So I don't blame him when you got this
state of the community, right?

203
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yeah, right. Right. Exactly. All right.
Let's see, anything else in the Sigmanauts

204
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
we've had... I think that's it. Why don't
we jump to questions and we can go off

205
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
that. Let's see what we have.

206
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Alright, let's see we have HQx says good
morning. That's very clever HQx from

207
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
MewFinance. We have Ahmet says do you like
the QX Turkey group? Is there a specific

208
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
QX Turkey? Were you asking if I like the
Turkey group? There's a Turkey group, it's

209
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
like at least the one that I was sucked
into a couple months ago, maybe six months

210
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
ago, felt like a mix between Gulag and the
old bad Baseless kind of thing right in

211
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
between there. It felt like the outcasts
from Baseless before they got put into

212
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Gulag. At least a group I was in. I don't
know if I was in an official Turkey group,

213
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
but there were some pretty angry people in
there. But then there were also some good

214
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
people that reached out to me on DM and
said, hey, don't listen to this guy. He's

215
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
just being crazy. So you get a mix of
everything. But I haven't been in there in

216
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
a while. Maybe I'll check it out again.
We'll see. We'll see what it's like.

217
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Let's see. Oh, here we go. It's a good
question from Wombo 22. Hi, MG. How's it

218
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
like being in the EF? Anything you can
share from an insider perspective for

219
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
others wanting to look in?

220
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Oh, yeah. I mean, EF, it's very, very
good to get oversight and understanding of

221
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
their operations and all. And I would say
a lot of cool things that I get to do as

222
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
part of EF is on some development
proposals. So EF is open to anyone

223
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
submitting a proposal for, like making the
ecosystem better or more specifically like

224
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
development-wise, right? Like make a
better infrastructure. For example, we

225
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
support like Sigma Explorer or something
along those lines. It's an explorer by PGR

226
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
and it is a really good explorer, a very
good UI and it has a completely different

227
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
back end built from the ground up. The
Ergo Explorer just uses the same API as

228
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
the normal main Explorer. But this new
Explorer, Sigma Explorer, it's completely

229
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
done from the ground up. So it's very
impressive and it has the best

230
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
performance. It's definitely the fastest
and most scalable Explorer we have today.

231
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's one of the projects that we help
sponsor for hosting and all, because it

232
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
gets expensive when you need it to scale.
And we help out with Stability Nexus,

233
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
right, with their protocols, such as
Gluon. Yeah, a lot of projects, what is

234
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
it, Cyberverse as well, we helped out. So
that's really cool. We get to vote,

235
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
there's also a bunch of projects that we
can't, right? But we try to help them if

236
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
they have an impact on the overall
ecosystem. I think a recent one is the

237
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Sigmanauts mining proposal so I think
that's very interesting and I'm supportive

238
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
of it so we're still waiting to achieve a
consensus on that because it's a good

239
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
chunk of funds that they requested but I
believe mining is an integral part of Ergo

240
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
and we really ought to push for mining
when we have this momentum because there's

241
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
really no good GPU mineable coins at the
moment. Maybe like one or two but they're

242
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
all new blockchains so you don't have much
trust or... They're just not very hard. Or

243
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
they're just tokens that you mine on other
blockchains, which is also just as much

244
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
more useless. It's just a mineable meme
coin at that point. So Ergo has a huge gap

245
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
to fill. So hopefully, the Sigmanauts are
doing a great job at trying to claim it.

246
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And to speak of that, Mark, for I think a
day or so, on Monday the 11th, released

247
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
his technique for mining Rosen tokens or
ecosystem tokens. So the way it works is,

248
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
you point to the pool you go to the
dashboard where the stats dashboard and

249
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
the payout dashboard? So you go to that
and there's a mint button and on that mint

250
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
page you can choose I want all Rosen
tokens or I want all Rosen Bitcoin or I

251
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
want all Rosen ADA or I want all CYPX or I
want all ERGs and then you can say I want

252
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
you to pay me out when it reaches the
equivalent of 20 or 50 or so for the big

253
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
miners. They're not getting their wallet
dusted every time we get a block. So you

254
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
can set that there. But then the cool
thing is, too, is you can set percentages.

255
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So I can say, look, I want 10% of my token
in CYPX, because I love Cyberverse. I want

256
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
50% in ERG. And I want 20% in Gluon Gold.
So you can actually mine gold. It's

257
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
countless thing. And so then you just
leave that NFT that mints in your wallet,

258
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and Mark's software will scan your wallet
and do your payouts based on that.

259
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So it's super, super cool. He had it on
for, I think, two days and then pulled it

260
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
back and turned on mine core payments
again. He's just got a couple more tweaks

261
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
to do. Sometimes when you're doing stuff
in testnet, and you have, even if you have

262
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
a couple people using it, there's so many
things that you don't get like you would

263
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
from the main group and 45 people banging
against it kind of thing. So, of course,

264
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
that's the beauty of the Sigmanauts DAO,
Mining DAO, is that everybody that's there

265
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
for the most part, is in agreement that
this is a community-run mining pool and

266
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
we're all there to test it, we're all
there to push kind of the boundaries and

267
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
do that. So that's super cool that we have
that platform to do that on and that we

268
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
have somebody like Mark the Shark to do
those kind of new things and testing.

269
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So that's also kind of what the proposal
is for the EF that Mark put out there. As

270
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
well as kind of utilizing Ergo mining as
an education tool for other miners and

271
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
other non miners. So big project. Super
cool. I hope the funding comes through for

272
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
them. Because I think that's wildly
important. I mean we're a proof-of-work

273
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
chain. It's how we secure the damn
network. We need to make sure that people

274
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
know why it happens and how it happens and
make it cool.

275
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I mean mining, mining core has been the
same or mining pools have been the same

276
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
like forever, right? Now that we're doing
storage rent and this kind of swap in the

277
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
middle, that's like super cool. There's
what, there's that mining site that you

278
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
can CPU mine like bitcoin even kind of
thing? It's like a swap site. Oh nice

279
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
hash. No, no nice hash...

280
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
unMineable

281
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
No, no, no, no, there's a specific site
you go to and you can mine whatever coin

282
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
you want with whatever card you want,
swaps in the background for you, but

283
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
people have gone there on mine. Oh, yeah.
There you go. Thank you. And the fees are

284
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
just absolutely outrageous. Complete, when
you're dealing with a small margin when

285
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
you're mining, you got to be careful with
those fees because it's gonna eat into

286
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
your damn thing. So Mark is very
positioned it very competitively.

287
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah, HQx says unMineable here. Yeah, so
competitively, so that's super cool. The

288
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
other cool thing about the mining is that
we've been getting a lot of notice on

289
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
socials on Twitter saying, holy cow, Ergo
is like number two or number one in the

290
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
profitable coin to mine when it was up
around 130, which I think it's around 124

291
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
right now. So we're in that threshold
there where I see people saying, oh, I'm

292
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
firing up my GPUs again. I'm pointing to
Ergo again. Kind of thing. So that's

293
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
really really exciting to see. Yeah, yeah.

294
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
All right. Let's see. Who do we have
here? Ahmet wants to know if kushti got

295
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
mad at him. That's why he's not here. I
don't think kushti stays too mad for too

296
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
long, but no, he didn't get mad at you.
Andy explained in the next bit there. Oh,

297
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
here we go. We got Jonas, Jonas, Jonas,
Jonas, if he's European, Jonas, Keystone

298
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
wallet soon. That's a PGR 456, right? I
think he said the end of the year

299
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
recently. He said for sure.

300
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Yeah. Currently we're blocked by a
library, a rust library. What is it?

301
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
There's some issue with one of the Sigma
rusts, how the code works. So we have

302
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
another developer, Dusek, who works on the
rust. So he's trying to fix that up. So as

303
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
soon as he fixes that up, PGR can continue
the Keystone work he's been doing. Again,

304
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
it's some cryptography thing, which is
quite time consuming and tedious.

305
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And for those PGR is the guy who also did
Sigma Explorer, the new explore. So just

306
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
so you guys are aware of what his
capabilities are. Super, super cool. Yeah,

307
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm looking forward to buying a Keystone
wallet. They look pretty damn cool. At

308
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
least the paper, like the paper like one,
right? With the paper, the E ink screen

309
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
looks really, really cool. Right now I
use, let's see... Is this a Nano or

310
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
something? I don't know. But this is
pretty good. But the issue is when we do a

311
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
refill of the GARD wallet, are you doing
this or is this LGD?

312
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
For Cardano, it's LGD.

313
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,000
LGD? LGD? I don't know. I forget. I mix
it up.

314
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Okay, so the funny, that's LGD. The funny
thing is when you do that, they're like

315
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
you have to verify like 15 transactions,
15 outputs. So you're literally like with

316
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
your little two fingers going button
button button button button button button

317
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
button button button. Like so many times
you have to view it, verify it then say

318
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
yes and slide over and you have to do that
like ten sometimes. So while this is cool

319
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
and functional and... It definitely hurts
for those bigger things. So it'll be nice

320
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
to use Keystone for that kind of thing. I
guess you can already for Cardano, right?

321
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Yes, yes. So I could get that up there in
the pipes and test it. Yeah, cool.

322
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You should, yeah.

323
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I should. You want to send me one, MG?
We've got Ahmet is on fire today like

324
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
third question. Asked is Kraken listing
imminent. Well, I mean at this point after

325
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:58,000
that leak on the Sigmanauts Twitter,
whoever that was, we fired them. They're

326
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
no longer working for the Sigmanauts
Twitter anymore. That's why you have

327
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
SuperGeometry there. You know as much as
we do at this point. That means that we're

328
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,000
on the shortlist. They have a backlog of
things on the shortlist, so we're at their

329
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,000
whim essentially when they decide to look
further into us and put that work in.

330
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
That being said, I still DM Mark Twitter
little sweet nothings. I think my last DM

331
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
was that I couldn't stop thinking about
him and gave him a Willie Nelson YouTube

332
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
link "Always On My Mind." He left me
unread this time. Usually he answers me.

333
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So that's I'm hopeful. I'm hopeful he left
me unread for a reason. Usually he writes.

334
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Yeah. Yeah, it's on the backlog, nothing
no news yet kind of thing. So we'll see.

335
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm hoping, I'm hoping, I'm hoping these
central exchanges at some point will

336
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
think, in order for us to survive... Cause
these meme tokens, right? These meme

337
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
chains, like you saw the post from Mark
the other day, he's like, Oh, I can

338
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
finally retire. I got dog with hat listed
in the U S or something. And like, like...

339
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I can imagine Mark coming home from work
and he sits down and his wife and kids are

340
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
like, Mark, did you change the world
today? And Mark's like, I did. I brought

341
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
dog with hat to the U.S. for purchasing.
And they were like, that's amazing.

342
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
In all seriousness though, I think
eventually these central exchanges, when

343
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
this kind of money runs out, if it will,
or when it burns down a little bit, we'll

344
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
eventually see that there's value in
listing something that's unstoppable,

345
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
that's sustainable, that has an amazing
community, like Proof of Work Ergo, like

346
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
other projects as well that are similar,
and they'll see a value in that. And then

347
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
at some point, of course, when while
trading on exchanges becomes a little more

348
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I don't know legal or whatever that's
gonna be perhaps we'll be forced to

349
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
actually invest in things and onboard
things that are legal and are organic. So

350
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
that's that's my hope there of our overall
kind of thing.

351
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
But then my crypto cyberpunk hope is that
they all burn up in a fire and they go

352
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
away. And we rely on decentralized
exchanges and fiat on-ramps direct into

353
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
the ecosystems for that kind of stuff. So
my word to the central exchanges are, you

354
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
know, be nice to be on there, but
hopefully you guys can get with the times

355
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
and start backing projects that are
sustainable, legal, and are organic. So

356
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
that's my message to them.

357
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Alright, let's see. Here we go. This is
from Odi Boja. I hear Cardano will build a

358
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
layer 2 partner chain where BTC will be
the token. Wouldn't it make sense if Ergo

359
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
joins the effort? The new chain would be a
partner chain on Cardano and a layer 2 on

360
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Ergo? Are you talking about Bitcoin OS? Is
that a whole other layer kind of thing?

361
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Yeah. I mean, we already have that
function, right? You can bring your

362
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Bitcoin over to Ergo and do whatever the
hell you want. And you can bring your

363
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Bitcoin over to Cardano, do whatever the
hell you want. You can bring your Bitcoin

364
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
to Ethereum and do whatever you want. I
mean, I get the idea, but I don't see if

365
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
we already have that functionality. Of
course it's an open system, whatever

366
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
anybody wants to do. But we already have
that functionality as far as that goes,

367
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
right. In some parts. What's your thoughts
there? Are you paying attention?

368
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Yeah, I think their technology is
interesting. They use ZK proofs instead of

369
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
a multisig bridge, which is very, I think,
new. Not many people have done it. It's

370
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
very convincing, right? The idea is you
don't even need any multisig trust, right?

371
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You just have to trust one person or
something like that, and you can make that

372
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
yourself. That's the whole idea behind the
bridge. So I think that's very

373
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
interesting. Also, you've got to remember
Cardano has so much money, so much

374
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
developers, right? So they can do so much
compared to us. We're just basically hobby

375
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
developers, except for kushti. So there's
not too much we can do, but I will say

376
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
that whatever layer 2 they achieve, Rosen
will be able to bridge to that.

377
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Right, right, right, right. Didn't kushti
at some point during one of the ErgoHacks,

378
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
two ErgoHacks ago, develop some sort of
messaging or consensus mechanism? He read

379
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Bitcoin proofs and verified them on the
Ergo chain? So is that a similar thing

380
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
that they're doing with their tech? Is it
the same kind of thing or no?

381
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I mean, I guess it's more advanced,
right? But I guess the ideas were quite

382
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
similar.

383
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Right, right, right. Right, it's like,
kushti's like rule 34. Do you know what

384
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
rule 34 on the internet is?

385
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Oh yeah, the artwork thing, yeah.

386
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It's uh, this is not a PG show MGPai.
It's all right. Rule 34 states that if it

387
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
exists there's porn of it on the internet,
right? So kushti is like a rule 34 of

388
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
crypto space. If it exists out there,
kushti's probably done it six months ago.

389
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
There's got to be a kushti rule 34 or
something like that. That's usually the

390
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
case. Oh, yeah, I did something like that
a couple years ago when Ergo first came

391
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
out. Yeah, it didn't work out and this is
why so we did this kind of thing. The

392
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
common thing you hear from kushti.

393
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
All right, let's see what we have here.
We have, oh, Bayoke saying good night from

394
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Indonesia. Let's see. Oh, here we go.
Here's a question for you, MGPai. Let's

395
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
see how much time you're spending deep in
the ecosystem. HQx wants to know your

396
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
thoughts on MewFinance, which I imagine
includes like the utility tools that they

397
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
have, the shop that they have, the mart
that they have, that's the physical site

398
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
as well. They're kind of staking tiers
where you can get discounts on listing

399
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
things based on how much you're staking
and also like I think they have revenue

400
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
sharing as well in those tiers as well
kind of thing. So all built in there. What

401
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
are your thoughts? Oh also escrow service,
right? You can I can go there I can put

402
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
something in a package and put your
address on it and then you can come pick

403
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
it up if you pay the fee that I say. What
are your thoughts MGPai?

404
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Yeah, of course, I think it's very cool.
And I'm glad that people are spinning up

405
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
new projects in the ecosystem. I think
they're trying to fill up a gap that

406
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Spectrum DEX kind of left us. They're not
really maintaining much on Ergo. I mean,

407
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
they built really a lot of cool tooling
already. But it's good that it's the power

408
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
of open source. If it dies, the community
can always take over. And I think that's

409
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
what we are seeing that's happening. I
know I heard that, I think a couple of

410
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Sigmanauts are selling on that, the
marketplace, right? So I think, that's

411
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
very interesting.

412
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Yeah, he's selling like organic honey on
there as well. Sigmanauts have some, yeah.

413
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Yeah.

414
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And then we have, I posted these guys.
Ooh. So if anybody, I posted them for 75

415
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
ERGs. They're Radeon 7s. One of them
doesn't post on Windows, the other one

416
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
runs fine. I ran it for a day at 75% and
just needs a little fan work, that's all.

417
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
So 75 ERGs and you can get two Radeon 7s
which... I guess if nobody buys it, I'll

418
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
lower it down. I just want to get out and
get them out of here. And I want to get

419
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
people pointed towards MewMart. So it's
more of an experience kind of thing, but

420
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,000
they're sitting on the side of my desk,
ready to be boxed up for anybody that

421
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
wants them. So super cool that you can go
there and get approved and sell actually

422
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
physical merch. Super, super neat.

423
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Alright, let's see. Oh, Wombo, what are
your thoughts on Ergo needing memes? So I

424
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:04,000
talked to kushti about this last week,
right? And unofficially got kushti's idea

425
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,000
of what memes are, right? MGPai, I'll let
you start. What are your thoughts?

426
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Yeah, I think, of course, that's how you
gain viral posts. I think Joe's been doing

427
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
a good job. He's been posting a lot of...
Oh, he's been killing it with those two

428
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
videos, right?

429
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Like the wedding video from... Was that
Old School? What was that? That was Old

430
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
School, the wedding video with the Will
Ferrell and then the show where the Sal

431
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
guy from... Oh, yeah beats crap out of
everybody on the bus. Absolutely. Yeah, I

432
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
think the first one, the first video with
Will Ferrell got... I think 10,000 views,

433
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
something like that. So really, really
good exposure. I wrote Joe, I was like,

434
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
that's great. And he's like, is that good?
I was like, for not having breasts, Joe,

435
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
that's a pretty good post. I mean, it's
true, right?

436
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Yeah, of course. I told Joe to make it
shorter right because if it's too long

437
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
then you lose attention. I think five ten
seconds is much better right because if

438
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
people like it they'll spend that much
time where you have to grab attention in

439
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
the first few seconds. But yeah it's very
good. I'm glad he's doing it. It's a good

440
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
way to convey his point.

441
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And you'll start seeing slowly, kind of,
not like crazy memes, but you'll start

442
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
seeing slowly some more, kind of, not
official, but more appropriate memes from

443
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
the main Ergo account, perhaps, until
people get really pissed. But we'll see.

444
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Right now, SuperGeometry is doing a great
job from Sigmanauts. He's got a lot more

445
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
leeway to post kind of crazy content. So
he's doing that and filling that role

446
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
greatly. I sound like Donald Trump. And
we'll try to start, interacting that from

447
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
the main account to with memes. So we'll
see how it goes. If you have a good one

448
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
send them to us and we'll see what we can
do.

449
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
All right. Let's see. Wendy moon. Hi,
Wendy. Wendy is a frequenter. Is there any

450
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
way to swap between Ergo and BTC and keep
it off exchanges? Just do it in your

451
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
wallet wrapped or BTC wallet. Yeah, yes,
of course. Right. We have, you can do it

452
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
on any chain, right? There's a lot of
liquidity, where's the most BTC liquidity

453
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
is in Cardano or is it in...

454
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I think Cardano, but I'm not sure. I
haven't messed with it. I have no reason

455
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
to go to BTC.

456
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Let me see. But yeah, yeah, of course,
Wendy, you can go to, let me go to ErgoDEX

457
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
right now while I'm talking. You can go
right from BTC through Rosen to wrapped

458
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
BTC and set it right in your Ergo wallet.
That way you didn't even hit ErgoDEX, or

459
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
right now you could. Let's see. Let's see
what the slippage is. If I want to swap a

460
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
thousand ERG. Yeah, if I want to swap a
thousand ERG on ErgoDEX right now without

461
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
even touching Bitcoin and just get Rosen
BTC, you'll take a 7.8% hit on liquidity.

462
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
So liquidity is not that high on ErgoDEX,
at least, or MewFinance, same smart

463
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
contracts. So your best bet would be
definitely to send it over the bridge,

464
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
most likely if you have more than that,
and just hold on to that Rosen BTC in your

465
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Ergo wallet, knowing that you have the
security of Rosen Bridge and the security

466
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
of another proof of work chain.

467
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I thought it was interesting that, and I
talked to, mentioned this with Joe quite a

468
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
bit in our talks, maybe late at night when
you're drinking whiskey on the live

469
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
versions of the dev updates. I thought it
was interesting that people would want to

470
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
send their Bitcoin to something like
Ethereum. I get that there's a lot of

471
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
liquidity there and a lot of financial
tooling, but it's literally, I feel it's

472
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
literally like taking your money out of a
bank and just leaving your wallet and

473
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
walking through the market essentially,
whereas Ergo has developed a massive

474
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
amount of tooling that lets you interact
with it right from the bank and the

475
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
security of that kind of thing, or
essentially walk around with a safe in

476
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
your pocket. So I always thought it was
interesting that, that's not a thought

477
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
like I'm actually going to a less secure
chain essentially from something like

478
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Bitcoin. So I was, the thought that the
allure of at least Ergo and the financial

479
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
tooling that we have would be like, we are
not compromising any security by going

480
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
over to Ergo and using the financial
tooling there. So I think that's something

481
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
we need to try to sell a little bit more
as well for that.

482
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Let's see. Answer that already. Oh,
here's a hype one. You like hype

483
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
questions. A big 3D question to both of
you. Do you guys think Ergo can hit top 20

484
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
this bull market like Dan believes? Like
Dan believes, we got to check in with Dan.

485
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm gonna send him that one. Yeah, you
know if Dan believes it I certainly

486
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
believe it. I think I think anything can
happen. I'm not trying to predict

487
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
anything, but I think Ergo at least has
the ability to shine in the manner of

488
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
security and the tooling that's there
already. The lending protocols, the I mean

489
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,000
your let alone your NFT release platform
is awesome and... All the projects we have

490
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,000
that are ready and fully baked and ready
for customers, essentially, there's no

491
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,000
reason and sub-blocks.

492
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
You guys aren't ready for that. It's
going to be really good. I mean, that's a

493
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
big missing piece.

494
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Hang on. MGPai. Do you have your hat?

495
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Oh, that's a bit far away.

496
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
There we go. Make mining great again.
Yeah, I think we're primed for it. I think

497
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
we definitely have the ability to be there
and sustain, have sustainability there.

498
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
The question just is, is the rest of the
space ready for that are going to realize

499
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
that? So we can't predict it, but...

500
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
My assumption is that Ergo closely
follows Cardano, right? So if Cardano does

501
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
well, I'm certain Ergo will do well. They
always move so super close to each other.

502
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So I know Cardano is going to do well for
sure. They've been doing really good stuff

503
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,000
lately. So I'm certain Ergo is going to go
up much more.

504
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
You heard it right there, folks. That's
not with your EF hat on though. That's

505
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
with your community developer hat on. You
said that. Right. Perfect. All right. All

506
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
right. Good timing. Kilver, Kilver, our
buddy Kilver. If you miss Kilver hasn't

507
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
streamed in a while. Kilver, have you
streamed in a while? Where are your

508
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
streams been, buddy? Maybe I've just
missed it. But Kilver has been an avid

509
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Cyberverse player, community member, and
streamer of Cyberverse. Do you guys think

510
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
now with Trump being so crypto friendly,
we will see a new alt mining resurgent?

511
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
You know, regardless of political
standings there, I will say, I think I

512
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,000
said it in the last AMA, prepare to be not
surprised, but prepare to be like, from

513
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
what I know about my experiences with
being an American or a United States

514
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
citizen and having Trump as president for
four years and what he promised before

515
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
campaigns and what he delivers on some of
these things. Some of it's hype, right?

516
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Some of it's just to get voters kind of
thing. But you got to look at actions. So

517
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
the facts are that he's brought on your
buddies, Elon Musk, right? Who is fairly,

518
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I don't know if, is Elon...

519
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Considered crypto friendly with Elon.

520
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,000
He's not against it. But I don't know if
it's like friendly. I don't know. He's

521
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,000
really weird. He just does Dogecoin like I
think it's more of like personal amusement

522
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
for him, right? Like you guys are bored,
right?

523
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I really feel that way. I do. I do. I
feel like if you ever finish a video game,

524
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
think of it this way, and then you put in
the cheat codes, you just get bored after

525
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
a while. You start throwing people off
cliffs or shooting people up in crazy

526
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
stuff. You just do crazy stuff. So I
wonder if Elon... And I think he's such a

527
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
bored.

528
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I think some people try to say he's like
manipulating the market. Like he's a

529
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
billionaire. I don't think he cares. No, I
think he has more money than the market

530
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
cap of Dogecoin or something. Yeah, market
cap Dogecoin is like what 30 40 billion

531
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
and he bought Twitter for more. So like I
don't think he's trying to manipulate

532
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
anything. He's just...

533
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
No, no. No. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, he's
definitely poking stuff. So I hope I still

534
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
have a worry that those kind of things
with how he talks about Dogecoin and those

535
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
things like what's the utility of Dogecoin
right now, right? Is there any utility in

536
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Dogecoin? No, no, I mean he's obviously
promoting something for the social aspects

537
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
and the idea of I guess a currency that's
so you can spend on chain I guess. I don't

538
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000
know. So I think overall it's obvious that
people believe that Trump is gonna be good

539
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
for crypto based on the price of Bitcoin
right now and some altcoins and...

540
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
But I think it's my jury's still out for
me, verdict's still out on the holistic

541
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
approach of how crypto is going to be seen
by the administration? Is it going to be

542
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
seen as this? Let's I mean couldn't say
Trump came out with his own token, right?

543
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And it's 70% down like come the hell on.
Like they're obviously riding the same

544
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
kind of speculative market that most of
crypto is. So is it good for crypto? If

545
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
you ask me that question as in, oh, I
guess it's alt mining resurgence. We

546
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
totally missed the point of the question.

547
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
But in general, I think Trump is going to
be good perhaps for the speculative side

548
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
of crypto. Do I think he's going to be
good at real organic adoption of chains

549
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
that are actually making a difference in
doing something? Maybe that's a side

550
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
effect there. My opinion only, but we'll
get to see. He's not even in office yet

551
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,000
guys. Let's talk in January about proof of
work mining resurgence. I think all it

552
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
takes for a proof of work mining
resurgence is the price of Ergo to go up

553
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
and then people are going to mine the shit
out of it. Right. That's it.

554
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:45,000
All right, let's see. What else do we
have? Wombo says there's another fish in

555
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:52,000
the CQX, don't worry. Oh, Mark, because I
was trying to seduce Mark from Kraken.

556
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Right, right, right. Oh yeah, FC, FC
CannonQ. MG, Palmyra going to launch a

557
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:06,000
coin or project, do you know any timing?

558
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Oh, you're asking me, I can't say.

559
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
That's, is it on, it's not on, it has
what's it called? The IDO they did. People

560
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
don't have the coins in possession right
or the tokens in possession. They have

561
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
them just investing tokens.

562
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
It's just like a pre-sale or something,
right? They have rounds of that. So

563
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
definitely, I can say we're having more
pre-sale rounds. I don't know how many

564
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
more, but that's certainly available. And
again, I don't think it's open to US

565
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
citizens. You have to have different
passport if you want to participate, I

566
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
think, but I'm not completely sure. I know
the past ones were not open to US

567
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
citizens.

568
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
All right. All right. Let's see. What
else do we have? We won't comment on that

569
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
one. I think Kilver says quality content
right there when we were talking about

570
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
rule 34. Thank you, Kilver. Appreciate it.
Any news from Sky Harbor team about the

571
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
work on the marketplace? You know, Kilver,
I don't know if I said this the other day,

572
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
but I think mid last month I pinged Quokka
during the AMA and he didn't get back to

573
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
me till after, but he says the front-end
UI version 2 has finished and in testing

574
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
will be releasing the open source code
when deployed. The backend is being worked

575
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
on and there's not much work left, so the
dev is still slowly chipping away at it.

576
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
That was a report from Quokka. So that'll
be nice when that's up. As I said, when

577
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
it's up, we're hoping that we can organize
the Sigmanauts to kind of take it over and

578
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
manage a front end version of it from that
open source code and use it as a treasury

579
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
revenue stream as well as maintain it so
that we can have a dev that can

580
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
continuously work on it and make it
better.

581
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Wombo wants me to do the dance QX. But
Dan, Dan does a great job at it. He's very

582
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,000
good at it. Kilver says that he's not,
he's moving into a new house, so he hasn't

583
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,000
streamed in a bit. He's going to start
again one to two.

584
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Congrats.

585
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention, guys, I've
been putting some liquidity into

586
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
TradeHouse on the Rosen side. I think I
put about only about maybe a couple

587
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
hundred ERGs worth on the Rosen side for
Rosen-ERG pair as well as maybe about 200

588
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
ERGs worth of CYPX in there as well. I
encourage all of you guys to go to

589
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
TradeHouse and just put your project
tokens in there or SigmaUSD or something.

590
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Just get a little bit in there. That's a
great opportunity, that's a great place

591
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
for people to come and swap where they
want to be able to visually see and kind

592
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
of control their slippage. They can say
I'm going to set an order here and only

593
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
take it at this price. And then if it
matches then it's great. If not, then

594
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
maybe they'll come out to your price, but
it's a good tool. We're going to try to

595
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
push it more on the TradeHouse Twitter, as
well as try to retweet from the main

596
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
account and Sigmanauts account. But we
need to get liquidity. That's a big thing.

597
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
That's what attracts people to these
dApps. And that's what keeps things

598
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,000
pumping. So please, if you can...

599
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Don't let that stuff burn a hole in your
wallet, your Nautilus or your Terminus or

600
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
your Minotaur. Go ahead and use it. Put it
out there. Even if you, so let's say

601
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
you're just like, I don't want to sell any
of my CYPX. I don't want to sell any of my

602
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
MewFinance token or Mew's not on
TradeHouse, but you get the idea. That was

603
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
a big thing for me too. So don't, then put
it at like 10% above Ergo. So remember the

604
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
way the order book works is when you put
in an order to sell, you're not selling

605
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,000
your CYPX or your Rosen or whatever for a
dollar amount. You're selling it for an

606
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,000
ERG amount, right? So you don't have to
touch that. Let's say the price of Ergo

607
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,000
goes up. Right? Your order in the price of
your token that you've matched it with

608
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
doesn't go up with ERG. Right? So now,
nobody's going to buy that thing because

609
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,000
it's way too expensive compared to the
price of ERG. Because you're still asking

610
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
for one ERG for a thousand tokens. And if
ERG goes up and the token doesn't go up

611
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
with it, you're asking for a higher valued
ERG for the same amount of tokens. So you

612
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
don't have to worry about switching it.
You don't have to worry about losing or

613
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
anything like that. You can take it off
and put it back there.

614
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
So the idea is if they both raise similar
which if anybody follows CoinGecko in

615
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
their portfolio or anything like that any
other portfolio. What's the Ergo one that

616
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Louie made? Oh, Crooks Finance? Crooks
Finance, yeah. And it is a portfolio, too,

617
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
like that. You'll notice that most of the
time, on average, over a series of days,

618
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
these guys all raise, right? Ergo raises
up, rising tide raises all ships, kind of

619
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
thing. So your token rises up. The cool
thing is once in a while you'll get tokens

620
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
that go a little above, go a little below
and catch up. So that's where you'll get

621
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
those deals that people will come in and
buy. So if you're worried about selling

622
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
your project token then set it at 10%
higher because if it spikes or ERG dips

623
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and the project token stays up then that's
a good opportunity that'll come in and do

624
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
that and you're not losing money
essentially kind of thing and then you can

625
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,000
always buy it back if you want to. But in
short use TradeHouse, use the order book

626
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
system, provide liquidity, yeah, provide
liquidity. That's the big thing. That's

627
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
why we look at these other chains and
we're like why is everybody using these

628
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
exchanges barely anything on there to do
kind of thing.

629
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Well, they're using them because it's a
massive amount of liquidity in the

630
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,000
ecosystem, right? So you can do a swap and
you're not losing 5% on anything. So in

631
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Ergo, we don't have that. We don't have
the big VCs that are going to be pumping

632
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
liquidity into these kind of things yet.
So it's up to us, right? In all it takes,

633
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
there's 10,000 people in chat, guys. If
everybody in chat, how many in the Ergo

634
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
chat? Do we know? Hang on, let's see.
11,435 people in the Ergo chat, just on

635
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Telegram's side. If everybody puts in one
ERG and a thousand CYPX or a thousand

636
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Rosen and a couple ERGs, that's just a
tiny amount in that order book. You're

637
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,000
going to have $10,000 or $20,000 worth of
depth in those order books. It just takes

638
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,000
a little bit from everybody. That's it.
That's it. And that's our weapon against

639
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
this kind of thing. That's our answer to
one dude or woman in Ethereum who puts in

640
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
a million dollars of liquidity somewhere.
We have to do this individually. It

641
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
doesn't mean that you have to put in
$10,000, just small amounts combined with

642
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
everybody's effort. And we have the same
effect, guys. That's all it's going to

643
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
take.

644
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,000
All right, what do we have? Well, we're
at 59:05. Since you joined five minutes

645
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:57,000
late, MGPai, that's the hour. Anything
closing? Are you missing class for this?

646
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:03,000
No, no, we're an hour behind our daylight
savings, right? So no classes start yet.

647
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Nice, very nice, very nice. All right,
anything to close with, sir?

648
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I don't know, we're going to the moon.

649
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Good closing. All right. Thanks
everybody. And if you didn't hear what I

650
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
said, the last five minutes invest in the
ecosystem projects, play Cyberverse, list

651
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
things on MewFinance, liquidity into
TradeHouse, list stuff on Ergo auction

652
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
house, all that kind of stuff. Use the
ecosystem. There are plenty of ways to use

653
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
it without the fear of losing your project
tokens. If that's your worry. Cause I know

654
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,000
a lot of Ergo people are just, let's hold
it in our bags. It's so precious. We don't

655
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
want to lose it. So. Do it. I have, as I
say, I have about 50 liquid ERGs right

656
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
now. Everything else is tied up in
ecosystem projects, so do it. Don't be

657
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
afraid. All right, everybody. Thanks for
joining. We'll see you tomorrow for the

658
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
community chat. It's on Zoom. Everybody's
welcome. I'll post it on Twitter again.

659
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Just come in chat. kushti will be there.
Joe might be there since, no, Joe might

660
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
not, Joe's not going to be there. But
we're getting devs. He announced it in the

661
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,000
dev chat. MGPai, you're going to try to be
there too. It's 3am for Dan, but maybe we

662
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
can get him there with the enticement that
somebody's going to yell at him. Dan likes

663
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,000
punishment. So we'll see. Come tomorrow, I
think, what is it, 4pm UTC? What was it?

664
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,000
And check our Twitter. You'll see the link
there. Thanks everybody. Enjoy your week.

665
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Bye guys.
