00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Nothing?

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Peer to peer.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah, there we go.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, it's a peer to peer network.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
There we go.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Welcome, welcome. We've got a couple
people with us today to start off. We hope

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that this is a community Zoom. If you look
in the YouTube description, you will see

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that there is a passcode and ID. Please
feel free to join in. There's a waiting

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
room. We've got somebody joining in.
Perfect. Don't be afraid to join and chat

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
with us.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Meanwhile, we'll just start off with a
normal AMA, I guess. We've got Nir coming

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
in, too. Let's bring them in. Hopefully,
we don't have any bad things happen in

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
these kind of circumstances, but my finger
is on the ban trigger, that's for sure.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We'll see how that goes.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
All right, what's new guys? How's
sub-blocks going? How's that Joe? You're

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
talking a lot about side chains. How's
that going? Sigma chains, all that good

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
stuff?

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, it's been kind of a goal for like
two years to look at this idea of taking

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
kind of the energy we have in proof of
work and start scaling horizontally,

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
right? That's something that's kind of
been a dream around Bitcoin actually for a

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
long time, where it's like you have all of
these people that are mining the chain and

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
essentially they're investing in SHA-256
machines, right? And it creates this

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
security wall that secures Bitcoin. Long
term, there's kind of a question in terms

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
of the economic sustainability of that
model, right? You know, after we see a

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
couple of halvings, the miner reward from
the blocks is on its own cascade downward.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And you kind of see this pattern that I
think Ethereum actually started, which is

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
where you get a lot of value leakage into
other layers of the network, right? So

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
when you have all of these layer two
solutions, what happens is people end up

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
essentially locking assets on the main
chain and the transactions move to another

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
layer. And the downside is that kind of
acts as this parasitic form of value

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
leakage from miners to, whatever set is
securing the layer two. So it kind of

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
represents this net loss and rewards,
right? And to some degree that actually

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
makes the sustainability more questionable
because not only are the security

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
subsidies of the blocks dropping, but the
transaction demand on the layer one itself

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
is dropping simultaneously, right? And
that's problematic. I don't know if people

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
have fully figured that out yet long term,
but that is the trend. And you can kind of

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
clearly see that with Ethereum where a lot
of the transaction volume is no longer on

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
the layer one. That's bad for miners,
right? And I know that many people kind of

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
dismissed mining, right? But ultimately,
that is the security mechanism for Bitcoin

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
itself. So there's like an incentive
misalignment that's occurring. And I don't

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
think it's fully shown up to where it's
popular enough to broadly talk about, but

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
it's starting. There's starting to be
questions like, okay, well, what happens

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
as an example, what happens if we need to
update some of the old address structure?

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Well, you're going to end up changing a
lot of the assumptions on the base layer.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If you say, okay, well, we're just going
to try to force this upgrade and how many

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
people lost their keys, how many people
have zoned out to where if there was some

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
sort of threat they're at risk, right?
We're already starting to see mainstream

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
talks about that. We're starting to see
discussions about drive chains on Bitcoin.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You know, with Rosen, we kind of both with
the bridge and allowing Bitcoin to access

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
other L1s as this smart layer and also
playing around with runes and OP_RETURNs

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and stuff. You know, we're hacking around
on Bitcoin for things that it wasn't

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
necessarily intended for, right? So
there's a question long-term in terms of

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
the path. If it's a miner-driven path,
what we'll see is that security umbrella

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
moves sideways, right? That way you get
this mechanism of pegging to a side chain

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and you get greater programmability, but
you also get miners absorbing more

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
transaction value. You get, many of them
are already mining Namecoin and other

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
SHA-256 driven rewards. So it's not as
though that's outside of the scope of

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
where miners are already focused, which is
extend your profitability. But there's a

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
programmability issue, right? In a
dev-centric future, they will move to

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
other layers because ultimately what
happens is usually developers control and

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
create a lot of value on layer twos. If we
see a mining-centric future, we're going

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
to see more of a horizontal scale towards
the drive chain idea. And then the

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
question is just how to securely do that.
How do you update to where there's like

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
this ability to trustlessly peg and move
sideways into different environments. It's

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
going to be a really interesting thing to
watch. I don't think it will fully, my

70
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
personal estimate is going to be like
2032. That halving is probably going to be

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
rough and it's going to put miners in a
position where they need to monetize their

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
value, right? And so with Ergo, we have a
greater programmability. So we have kind

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
of this ability to be in front of that
problem and create kind of a framework

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
design in UTXO that I would hope kind of
gets miners aware of this potential issue

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
because the layer two thing, well, yes, it
does potentially open up a lot of scale.

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's also relatively parasitic and it's
hard to align value there. If that makes

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
sense. So it's something that kushti and I
have been talking about for like two years

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
on and off. I know that initially I wanted
to try to create a merged mining framework

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
for super clusters, right? Which, I think
that's an interesting path. kushti came up

80
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
with a much more interesting path and as
usual, I lose the argument and my idea,

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
however valid it is, is less interesting
to me now than what he's come up with. But

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
that's the benefit of smart friends right
there.

83
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, but I think, well, different
directions to explore, right? So, well,

84
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:24,000
different consensus algorithms are still,
well, interesting topic, right? So, we

85
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:33,000
have still some demand for proof of work.
And then, yeah, well, we have a lot of AI

86
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:42,000
GPUs becoming obsolete in coming years.
Then, yeah, well, a lot of I6

87
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,000
underutilized because, yeah, well,
changed. They were created for not doing

88
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
quite well. So, yeah, a lot of possible
directions for sigma chains for consensus.

89
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But for programmability also, well, there
are a lot of interesting ideas to explore.

90
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So I've published global transfer policies
recently, right? Which is kind of a solar

91
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:27,000
punk mode to extreme, right? So well, you
can create basically your own money and

92
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:36,000
well, precisely define these rules. That's
it. But yeah, I think we also can do more

93
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:45,000
interesting experiments. So well in recent
few days I probably got an idea how to do

94
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:54,000
well pretty efficiently also kind of dark
tokens right on well maybe Ergo even in

95
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:03,000
the future but probably better to start
with sidechains right before doing some

96
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:12,000
hard fork to do some evolutionary
development on the main chain. So the idea

97
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:21,000
for dark tokens is to use not just numbers
as amounts but possibly arbitrary bytes

98
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:30,000
including encrypted amounts and then you
can use global transfer policies which are

99
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:39,000
checking that encrypted amounts are
correct, like done in Monero, for example,

100
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:48,000
with bulletproofs, right? Hiding amounts
as well as requiring for anonymized

101
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:57,000
transfers, for example, to stealth
addresses.

102
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Could you hide amounts in liquidity pools
as well in that manner? Like if you had,

103
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
any time you exchange, right, you're going
to expose the amounts that you're

104
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
changing. But if you could hide the
amounts in the liquidity pool as well, you

105
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
could potentially completely obfuscate the
transfer process right there with a swap.

106
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's hard to do well. Yeah, so if a pool
is public, right, then you need to show

107
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,000
its amounts properly, right? Well, to make
interaction possible. So you can do

108
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:43,000
somewhat pooling, but more limited than
public liquidity pools, right? So you can

109
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:52,000
use kind of a dark pool, but yeah, well,
hidden amounts, but maybe with possible

110
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:01,000
opening of chain, something like that. But
yeah, well, in general, if you have just

111
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Liquidity Pool, which is public, so
accessible to everyone, then everyone is

112
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,000
needed for some efficient on-chain method
to get amounts there. Otherwise, how can

113
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
you trade with it? Yeah, it's problematic.

114
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Imagine like trying to set a limit order,
but you can't read other limit orders,

115
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
right? Or you're trying to move into it.
You're trying to move into a pool, but you

116
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
have no idea what the liquidity and the
slippage is. So there are some areas where

117
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
it's like you need some mechanism to
understand data to make a decision. And so

118
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
if everything is totally private and you
have no ability to read it, the DeFi kind

119
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
of breaks down and that's been an
interesting problem to watch in this

120
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
space. I've seen some people kind of like,
I call it ZK spoofing where it's like,

121
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
maybe there's a central server that can
read everything, but users can't, and then

122
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
your trust assumptions in terms of who can
read and manipulate order flows, just

123
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
moves to a single party.

124
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Right. So yeah, if it's controlled by a
single few party, then yeah, it's can be

125
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:39,000
done in zero knowledge, right? Proofs
generated by those trusted parties, but

126
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:48,000
that doesn't make sense. Basically. Yeah.
It's zero knowledge proof. But that's how

127
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:57,000
people are usually trying to solve it.
Trying to sell solutions, let's say.

128
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We got quite a few in here. Why don't we
open up guys.

129
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Don't be shy. Don't be shy at all.
Grayman's texting.

130
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Hi, hi, Grayman. So yeah, well, I think,
well, it's Grayman and Joe here. So I

131
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:27,000
think there is need to revive efforts for
completing the Ergo book. So let's add

132
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Martin, maybe some of the guys willing to
contribute. And yeah, well, now some

133
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:47,000
writings are done. So I made like a few
writings in recent months are not public

134
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:57,000
yet. So well, now I can jump again on the
Ergo book and well, do some stuff there.

135
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
We've got MGPai. MGPai, why don't you
give us... Oh, no, Grayman, go for it.

136
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You're going to talk. Perfect camera on.
Let's hear it.

137
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I was just going to say I'm sorry, I've
kind of fallen off on that. I've been

138
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
pulled in a lot of different directions
recently, but where I was sort of stuck

139
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and going to try and I got halfway there
and the other half you had requested that

140
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I review the free banking era in America.
And I've been reading up on that in a

141
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
number of sort of weird contexts on a
state by state basis instead of the

142
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
federal basis. It's interesting. And I
really have to delve in and understand

143
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
ChainCash and practically how it's going
to work before I write that part because I

144
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
think that's the analogy that makes the
most sense. So I've been looking at that a

145
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
bit, but then I've got two new clients and
crazy stuff going on with my family. So it

146
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
is what it is. Life moves on, but I'll get
back to it soon.

147
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh, yeah, that would be amazing. So yeah,
for ChainCash, we now have even some new

148
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:18,000
contributors, right? And well, yeah, well,
still the blocker is the same. So yeah, we

149
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:27,000
need to define who will use it, right, and
how to do UI then. So then, yeah, like

150
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
foundational aspects do matter a lot here
in this definition.

151
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
MGPai, you there? You with us, sir? He's
there. Perfect. Hey. Nice. Where are you?

152
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Are you in Japan?

153
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah, I'm just leaving the office right
now.

154
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Safest city in the world, right?

155
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah.

156
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Awesome. Tell us about your release of
your... So for those who don't know, MGPai

157
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
is, when he's not being slaved by Dan and
forced to work for zero pay for Palmyra

158
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and Zengate, he runs a consulting and dev
firm called Four Eyes. So the Sigmanauts

159
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
have hired Four Eyes a bit back to create
SigmaLock. And why don't you give us an

160
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
update on that, MG, if you've got a sec.

161
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yeah, yeah, for sure. So, we're quite
excited for this release. You know, we've

162
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
been working on it for quite some time.
Actually, well, unfortunately, it's been

163
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
like a year since start, but I couldn't
work on it until like last month.

164
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh, we don't want to hear excuses, MGPai.
Just dive right into it.

165
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm very excited. You
know, a lot of work's been put into it. I

166
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
rewritten, I mean, I written from scratch
like an entire indexing framework in Go

167
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
lang, which is like a language which very
few Ergo apps, if any at all, are written

168
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
in. So it's completely done from scratch.
And this will allow like really, really

169
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
good performance for the users on the user
end. So people will see any transaction

170
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
they do for a specific contract,
instantly, right? Because we're not

171
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
querying the blockchain or anything,
right. We're parsing a transaction, you're

172
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
querying a backend directly, which stores
the exact data that you need. So it's

173
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
really fast. So it's a good user
experience. I've included indexing with

174
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
mempool, which is like big, it was like so
much extra work because you know, there's

175
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
so many edge cases you've got to handle,
like transactions dropping or being

176
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
replaced and so on. But with this indexer,
it considers all that. And as soon as a

177
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
user makes a transaction, it's going to
show up in your UI, like you'll see it.

178
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And then you can see it confirmed in real
time. And so on. So, you know, we're

179
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
really focusing on the user experience and
making it as good as possible because the

180
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
idea is that this project is going to be
completely open source. So anyone in the

181
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
community can take a look and fork it, use
it however they want. But for me, the main

182
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
goal is to have like a foundation to just
continuously build on, right? You get it

183
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
right the first time. Then you just copy
paste, like the boilerplate framework for

184
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
all your other projects. And furthermore,
you know, I spent a good amount of time on

185
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
it to be ready for sub-blocks and all. So
if I ever want to integrate that, you

186
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
know, it's ready to go.

187
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's awesome. Yeah.

188
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You want to go ahead and explain what
SigmaLock is, what the project is about?

189
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah, so the idea was, you know, we have
locking things on, we have things like

190
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
HODLERG, and HQ just came up with a
locking mechanism like an hour ago, just

191
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
announced it, congrats HQ. But we wanted
something that was more of a, something I

192
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
could sell to my grandpa or somebody like
that. And the idea was, could we create a

193
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
product that competes or is similar to
kind of like a life insurance passover or

194
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
some sort of inheritance kind of thing to
where we could lock something up and we

195
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
have choices of whether it's still in our
control or not in our control and somebody

196
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
else's. So the idea was that let's have a
system that somebody can go to. They can

197
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
choose how long they want to lock it up
for. They can even actually set, this is

198
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
an addition, they can even set a price
strike as well that lets it unlock at a

199
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
price strike if it gets crazy. So you can
go there, you can choose some options

200
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
right at the beginning that say, look, I
want to create, let's say two unlock keys,

201
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and that's it. And these unlock keys can
only unlock it if the price of ERG goes to

202
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
$1,000 or 20 years have passed kind of
thing. So then you can give those unlock

203
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
keys to your children or your
grandchildren or your lawyer or some sort

204
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
of digital lockbox or something that keeps
things for legal reasons. And that's

205
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
option A, essentially, where everything's
you can't do anything once it's set.

206
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Right. But we all know that things change
in the future. Maybe your kid joins

207
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Zengate and he betrays you and pisses you
off and you never see him again kind of

208
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
thing. And you want to cut them out of the
will. So instead, you can check a little

209
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
box that says the creator of this contract
still has permissions to completely modify

210
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
the contract. So at that point, you check
that box. And then in five years, when

211
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
MGPai leaves us for somebody else, I can
sever him, I can rewrite the contract and

212
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
sever that from, pull my funds out, redo
the contract and make new keys and send

213
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
them to my other favorite children or
something like that. So giving some

214
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
flexibility in that kind of thing, like
they exist outside in the real world, as

215
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
well as the ability to really lock it in
and be immutable with a smart contract.

216
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's the idea. We're trying to create
things that make sense on chain, not just

217
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
bash blockchain over the head of things
out there that might not make sense. This

218
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
kind of stuff makes sense. You have a lot
of wealth in the blockchain system right

219
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
now, and we're not at that stage where
people are dying too fast and holding on

220
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
to their ERGs because it's such a young
system that this is going to be something

221
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I think that people might be interested in
in the future, near future. Yeah, and Four

222
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Eyes has been great.

223
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What's that, Grayman?

224
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What happened to Dan?

225
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I think he fell asleep on the keyboard,
passed out.

226
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yeah, it's quite late in Japan right now.

227
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's like 11 o'clock, 11:30? 10:30. Oh my
gosh. What are you, like, a high schooler?

228
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yes, yes. Getting to my bedtime soon.

229
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
They've got good whiskey in Japan. He
should be awake.

230
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh, yeah. That's true. No, Dan's been
working hard. I think he had some early

231
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
morning meetings at like 6 a.m. or
something and 2 a.m. stuff. Unfortunately,

232
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
the Japan time zone isn't favorable for
business meetings.

233
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Well, let's hear from HQ. HQ, you want to
unmute and tell us about your new release

234
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:52,000
an hour ago about your lock program. Maybe
HQ is asleep too.

235
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Hey, good evening, everyone. Hey,
basically more simple way of doing this,

236
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
right? It is not backed by any backend. It
is already done on Explorer uses the

237
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Explorer APIs to fetch the boxes. It is
simple and just go and do I want to lock

238
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
this much till this height and the person
who creates the box has the only right to

239
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
unlock it. You can lock tokens, you can
lock ERG, you can lock NFTs and you can

240
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
lock everything which is on chain. So
that's simple and I think that was the

241
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
requirement from some of the community
members. So we just kept it simple that

242
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
way.

243
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Nice. So you're protecting yourself
against yourself. It's a good way to force

244
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
yourself to hold, I guess, right?

245
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Yep. Maybe you can put that new Mew you
got in that lockbox, HQ.

246
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I think I will add option to add names to
the boxes. So I will maybe add name of my

247
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
son. and we can name the boxes with the
name, or we can add description to the

248
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
boxes.

249
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yeah, that would be nice. That would be
cool. That is cool. Very cool. Nice. How

250
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
long you been working on that HQ? You do
it in secret and just popping it out? Or

251
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
did you bang it out with some coffee in a
late night?

252
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Yeah. I think some people take one year
to build it. I just take one day.

253
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Oh, shots fired, MGPai. You're going to
let that happen?

254
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Oh, he's not going to answer that.

255
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
That's only cause Dan hasn't got a hold
of you yet.

256
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Poor MGPai. He's got
point two percent of his time that he can

257
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
devote to anything other than Dan. So
that's what happens. Oh boy. Well, what

258
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
else is new guys? Chris? What's it any
anything in the pipeline any theories or

259
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
philosophies you've been working on that
you want to implement?

260
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Yeah, I guess so. It's going to take a
while. It's heavy on the front end, so you

261
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,000
know how we are with UIs and Ergo. Always
a long stretch of development there. Seems

262
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
like we're getting there. I like what HQ's
got going on though. You know and

263
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,000
everything over at MewFinance. That's
pretty cool. I use that a lot probably

264
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
going to be looking at some of that
front-end code for the swapping and

265
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
exchanges for what I'm working on. But it
is, it's just really an idea stage right

266
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
now, so we're thinking about how to
develop an application for coupons

267
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
basically fundraisers, and this is a US
project so it's quite complicated where

268
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
you know everybody with rewards might be
able to trade their rewards for rewards

269
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
that somebody else might have and use
those in different areas of their

270
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
communities. It'll be community focused in
a sense. So these coupons that you know

271
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
you have for shopping at your supermarket,
you can trade off for rewards that

272
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
somebody has earned at the car wash, let's
say. In a free market kind of place. And

273
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
you know that the intention there is to
provide our communities with a free

274
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,000
trading platform and kind of goes along
with our ideology of providing peer to

275
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
peer access on different levels where you
have Joe and kushti working on these high

276
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
level projects. And I think a little bit
down on the ground where how can we build

277
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
something that can be replicated for
normal user in peer-to-peer fashion. If

278
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,000
that doesn't make any sense there on the
coupon side of things, I think that it's a

279
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,000
good benefit for communities. In my
vision, I see where high school

280
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
fundraisers and church fundraisers might
pull up our application, put their donors

281
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
or contributors, business contributors
that are in their community, put their

282
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
coupons on this application and allow
their community to trade back and forth.

283
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And I think it's kind of a LETS idea
without having all the equipment and

284
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,000
technology, try to make it user friendly.
So that's why I say it's heavy on the

285
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
front end. And tax ramifications.

286
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
LETS without tax ramifications. Yes,
nobody is going to tax me when I buy my

287
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
coupon book.

288
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Just list coupons on MewFinance and
that's it right? You can just list coupons

289
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
on MewFinance and it is P2P so someone
wanted they can buy it and you can use

290
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
another source to just provide them with
the codes and that's it. So you have front

291
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
end for it and you have back end for it
too. And it is all on chain.

292
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
But isn't this, isn't what Chris is
explaining more of a, Hey, I've got, you

293
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
know, this many points at BJ's. I want
this many points at Walmart. Can we do a

294
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
swap from BJ's to Walmart for these kinds
of things? Is that where you're explaining

295
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Chris, as opposed to I want to buy with
ERG your points?

296
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,000
No, so the ideal application for this
would be you and I attend the same school,

297
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
QX, and we're a part of our fundraiser for
our football team. And we go out and in my

298
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,000
part of the country, we were always
creating fundraisers for our kids. And

299
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
it's sourced from community businesses,
mostly where a business says, yeah,

300
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,000
they'll contribute and they'll give these
offers and they create a coupon booklet,

301
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
usually a physical item. And then these
kids can go out and sell these coupon

302
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
booklets for $20, $50, different prices.
And then the community can have a coupon

303
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,000
booklet to go out buy different things
from the community. Well what I find is

304
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
that I don't use half that booklet when I
buy one, okay, so these coupons still have

305
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,000
value and I might end up giving them away
giving them to one of my sisters one of my

306
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
brothers or grandma. And the idea would be
that QX, you like a particular item in

307
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:14,000
that coupon book, and I like a particular
item in that coupon book, and we create a

308
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,000
market that allows us to trade back and
forth. This is on a very, like I say, on a

309
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:28,000
very small scale in a community. And so
your points of value where you have 20%

310
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,000
off on a frozen custard. Hey, I want in on
that. You know, let me give you 20% off on

311
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,000
what, what do you like a hamburger? What
is it? You know? And so creating a very

312
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,000
small trading platform for each individual
community. And HQ putting these kind of

313
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
things on MewFinance is it's a great idea.
You know, but with what I'm looking at

314
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
doing, it's also going to take a marketing
campaign. So very much going to be like,

315
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,000
not a MewFinance, not really centered on
Ergo exactly on how to market this to

316
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
fundraisers people that want to raise
funds for their football team people that

317
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,000
want to raise funds for their church or
for their local golf course, you know.

318
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's the marketing is another big push on
the front side of things. But it's very

319
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,000
specific to how to distribute this free
marketplace for communities. And it's

320
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,000
going to be very little on the marketing
side about blockchain and how to use

321
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
peer-to-peer finance. But the underlying
message of peer-to-peer for communities is

322
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,000
the fundamental foundation that I'm going
to be standing on to do it. So that's kind

323
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:06,000
of what's in the pipeline. It'll probably
be a year or two before something like

324
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,000
that really rolls out just with all the
work that goes into it, but definitely

325
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,000
going to be running on Ergo.

326
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So if you want to market it to the
fundraising people, then you got to make

327
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
it easy for them to reach out to the
sponsor people. That's going to be the

328
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
trick is making a nice interface for that.
But don't tell us how you're going to do

329
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
it because pretty soon it'll end up on
MewFinance too.

330
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
You guys keep using this M word. I'm not
familiar with it. Can you explain what

331
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
this marketing? What word is that? I don't
know.

332
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Oh boy. That's awesome, Chris. Anybody
got an update on Keystone Wallet? We got a

333
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:18,000
question. Didn't PGR456 give a good
update? He just did something last week

334
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:27,000
recently, kushti?

335
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Just looking for an update on Keystone.

336
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Oh, so the latest is from July 21st and
it was tweeted by the Keystone. So yeah,

337
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:48,000
the latest is about connecting Keystone to
Nautilus, generating transactions, signing

338
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:56,000
requests for Keystones, can sign
transactions from Keystone, done. What's

339
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,000
remaining? Bug fixing in transaction
serialization. Finish Nautilus-Keystone

340
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:12,000
interaction UI design, full integration
tests. So yeah, it's signing with

341
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Nautilus, so quite close. It seems. And
yeah, well, there was some video published

342
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
on July 21 as well. I guess it's on the
Twitter also. So you can find it in the

343
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Keystone wallet Twitter. But yeah, I think
it was posted around. Yeah, we retweeted

344
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:44,000
it too. I talked with the team yesterday.
Yeah, they said that it would be like four

345
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,000
weeks to six weeks to have Ergo ready. So
that's what the estimate time they gave

346
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:00,000
me.

347
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Yeah. They want me to build a custom page
for them on VoltPay so they can accept

348
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
multi-chain payments and sell keystones.
So that's what the estimate time they gave

349
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
me.

350
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Are those Rosen weeks or are those
Keystone?

351
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I'm sure they're not Ergo developers, so
they don't understand the four weeks

352
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
thing.

353
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
HQ, when are you going to put more stuff
up for sale on MewFinance for Mew? I was

354
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
hunting through there to spend some Mew.

355
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You have merch already on sale on
MewFinance for Mew? On proof of merch.

356
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
No, I mean for Mew. I want to buy stuff
with Mew.

357
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Okay, I will talk to the guy who makes
mugs.

358
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I want to buy a mug. I want to buy one of
those beautiful mugs for Mew instead of

359
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
SigUSD. Put a bunch of stuff up with Mew.
I'd love to spend some Mew.

360
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I will see if I can convince Echo to add
maybe Mew to proof of merch so it will

361
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
have its own Mew delete there too.

362
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Oh, that'd be awesome. I also mean the
handmade mugs too, the guy in Europe that

363
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
makes them. That's beautiful.

364
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
That depends on him. If he wants to get
paid in Mew or not.

365
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:19,000
What's that kushti, by the way, do you
hear me guys? Yeah. Yeah. So parcel sent

366
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:28,000
by proof of merch, reached Dubai recently.
And yeah, a pal of mine is quite excited.

367
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yeah, about it. Let me what did you order?
kushti messages. So it was some merch and

368
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:46,000
a few t-shirts. Maybe a couple of mugs. I
forgot. That's awesome. But but yeah, the

369
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:55,000
guy is very excited about it. And yeah,
we'll promote around now with some merch.

370
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So, yeah guys, please order proof of merch
and spread around.

371
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Yeah, as soon as you add Mew to that HQ,
I'll order a bunch of stuff. I couldn't

372
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
imagine spending my Mew any other way.

373
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
All right, Grayman, you threw a question
in chat. You want to use your pretty voice

374
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
to ask a question?

375
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Sure. Actually, I got two now. And they
might be related to each other. So the

376
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
first one is about Rosen and the guards.
And it makes sense to me that it started

377
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
out as a federated system because on some
level you have to start with trust to

378
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
build a trustless system, right? You have
to start with people that you know are, I

379
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
mean, it should have some slashing and
other tools to make it so that you can

380
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
punish people that act poorly. But if you
go right out of the gate, and that's all

381
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
there is, is a whole bunch of people
attacking the thing that would not be

382
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
good. But eventually, to get to the stage
where it's sort of living in the wild, and

383
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
if Joe gets hit by a bus, and so do all
the other devs, it still lives. Carried

384
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
off by an eagle, whatever it is.

385
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
A bear. A bear's more appropriate for
Joe.

386
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Fells a tree on himself. Then we need it
to keep going. So you got to have a way

387
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
for these guards to be permissionless,
right? What is the how do you do that? How

388
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
do you transition from one approach to the
next?

389
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Joe, let me fix this real quick. Let me
fix one thing real quick before you jump

390
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
in. So my understanding of federation is
federation is the ability to remove access

391
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
currently at any time. Right? So while the
guards, I guess you could throw around the

392
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
word federation where the guards were hand
selected, right? I would call that more of

393
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
a startup ceremony perhaps. Selected. Once
they're selected, essentially slashing can

394
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
begin. And there's no federation in that
Rosen can say, oh, Sigmanaut, you're out,

395
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
bye. We're just selecting you and removing
you. It would still take the other guards

396
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
to perform a new ceremony to include, you
know, some new signing keys and all that

397
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
kind of stuff. There's no federation
currently, I believe, with the Rosen guard

398
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
set. There's a selection process, yes. I
would be hesitant to say that the guards

399
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
set become like the watchers set where
it's permissionless, and Joe can correct

400
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
me if the vision of Rosen is different
than this, but as far as I understand it,

401
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
the guards are always going to have a
choice whether they perform a ceremony to

402
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
include people or not at some point. So
that's always going to be somewhat of a

403
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
selection process in that manner,
different from the watchers as far as I

404
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
understand. So I don't believe it's
federated at this point because there's no

405
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
way for people to be removed without the
full guard set being able to be involved

406
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
with that. Joe, go for it.

407
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Sure. So in starting Rosen, the ideal
would be that you have some sort of

408
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
collateral in order to set up that set,
some economic treasury that backs the

409
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
value being transferred. And I think that
if you're trying to bootstrap a peer to

410
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
peer community locally, one thing that I
think is very valuable collateral is

411
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
actually a history of proof of work,
right? So it's like, okay, this person has

412
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,000
a skill set and they've demonstrated the
ability to create value, right? More than

413
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
just credit as collateral. So that was a
big part of how the initial set was

414
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
established. Now, longer term, in my mind,
the thing that makes the most sense is to

415
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
always try to build yourself out of
importance, right? And I think that there

416
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
is a powerful way to potentially do that
where you actually create an avenue to

417
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
where you allow multiple various guard
sets to use the same second layer, right?

418
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So let's say that Grayman and Byron and
Chris get together and say, hey, we're

419
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
going to form our own guard set with our
own collateral treasury, and we're going

420
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
to actually start settling transactions
for people. I think that having the

421
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
ability to scale the guard set sideways
beyond just a singular party is probably

422
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
the best way to foster competition right
and then it's like as a user you know you

423
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
may actually get to the point longer term
where it's like okay you want to transfer

424
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
asset from here to here well you have
multiple intermediaries you can go through

425
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
that have various levels of let's say
treasury backing so then you kind of get

426
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
this idea where a user may be able to go
through different intermediaries depending

427
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
on their level of collateral they hold
their history in terms of how quickly they

428
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
settle transactions and actually create a
competitive framework around it. It's kind

429
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,000
of hard to make it fully, I would say
non-federated. So the best way to foster

430
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
competition is then to create open
competition between federations, if that

431
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
makes sense. But yeah, I think that should
always be the goal is it's not necessarily

432
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
to build solely to capture value, but to
build innovation is then to create open

433
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
competition between federations, if that
makes sense. on that, then it's like they

434
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,000
have this avenue to come in and
potentially out-compete the original guard

435
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
set. Potentially they could adjust how
quickly things settle, but that comes with

436
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
trade-offs. You may want, if something
moves faster, you have less confirmations

437
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
and especially in proof of work. There's
always this idea that energy added to the

438
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
chain enhances the assumption of
settlement, right? So sometimes if you

439
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,000
have cross-chain mechanisms that are
optimistic and they're faster than the

440
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
chains assumptions I'm not sure how long
we can go with that until something breaks

441
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
but that's more of an you also adjust fees
and

442
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,000
We made Rosen super modular and we
haven't really flexed that to where it is

443
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,000
possible to not just adjust the fee in
terms of the bridge basis, it's actually

444
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
token by token by token on the map. So we
could potentially say, hey, perhaps we

445
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
create a marketing campaign around this
one token, or perhaps we make that a fee

446
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
service where if somebody locks Rosen or
pays some sort of fee for that service, we

447
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,000
could actually individually raise and drop
the fees. Long term that's powerful. Short

448
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
term governance can be like herding cats
and unfortunately sometimes I'm like the

449
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
hardest cat to herd. So it's like the
blind leading the blind. But I do think

450
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
that like as a long term path of creating
a competitive federation of guards

451
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
actually makes the most sense from a free
market approach and an open source

452
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
approach. Otherwise, we just keep building
to where my relevance increases and that's

453
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,000
not really the position I want to be in
long term is more and more responsible.

454
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Ideally, if you build something that's
open and has decent security assumptions,

455
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,000
you become less and less responsible as it
proliferates and this organic growth takes

456
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,000
over. And that would be the optimal
outcome.

457
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So then the other question was about
Nautilus. and is it possible to just sort

458
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,000
of gank some other wallets, open source
code, I don't know, like Electrum or

459
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,000
whatever, and add BTC as a native and then
build some sort of a structure so that I

460
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
never have to leave my wallet. I don't go
to a rosen.tech app, but I just put my

461
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,000
wallet, you know, switch between BTC and
RSBTC or other Rosen, you know.

462
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Yeah, so when we designed Nautilus, we
did actually make, we re-engineered the

463
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,000
backend to where long-term we have the
ability to support multiple environments.

464
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And that's important if you wanted BTC in
Nautilus, you'd actually need information

465
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
from the Bitcoin blockchain. And the other
let's say component there that would be

466
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,000
needed is going to be SDK to integrate
Rosen directly into the wallet. And that's

467
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,000
kind of been our. I don't want to say
bastard child, but let's just say it's

468
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
something that we've been working on as we
have the bandwidth, which long term. We've

469
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
kind of been in this position with Rosen
where the ability to connect environments

470
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
is, let's say, a powerful base, but you
actually need something on top to where

471
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
liquidity providers can manage assets.
It's one thing to be able to move assets

472
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,000
into different environments, but you need
some sort of middleware on top to be able

473
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,000
to manage them in a uniform environment,
right, instead of a fractioned

474
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,000
environment. And so we've been in this
process of working with Hummingbot for

475
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:45,000
quite a while We actually were next in the
queue to get support and then they said

476
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
hey we're going to refactor a lot of our
code and you know move towards kind of

477
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,000
like a I think a lot of it had to do with
actually following liquidity, which is

478
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,000
kind of natural where they wanted to say
okay Well, we need to optimize this to

479
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,000
support Solana because a lot of liquidity
is moving to Solana so we're going to

480
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,000
refactor our code base to work more with
that environment versus being more

481
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Ethereum centric and then that kind of put
us on a holding pattern for a while as

482
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,000
they updated their code base. And they
should be open to new connectors in

483
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
version 2.8, which I think right now they
just released 2.7. So hopefully we

484
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
actually can get that kind of unified
experience. And that makes Rosen a lot

485
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
more powerful, in my opinion, because then
you not only get quick arbitrages in

486
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,000
different environments, but you also have
a lot of central exchange connectors. A

487
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:57,000
lot of market making outfits will use
Hummingbot and then they'll just write

488
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,000
their own parameters for trading. They do
kind of come with the default settings and

489
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
usually people will throw up some Python
scripts with whatever the let's say

490
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,000
parameters of the project they're trading
with are. So it's a really powerful tool

491
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:21,000
that is coming online, not just market
access, but market making those two need

492
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,000
to go together. And so far they haven't.
So I haven't worried too much about the

493
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,000
liquidity and activity and Rosen because
it's an incomplete product in my opinion.

494
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:39,000
until that second layer is there, it's
like, yes, we have this ability to move

495
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
from Ergo to Cardano or from Bitcoin to
Ergo, but when you see the price slipping

496
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,000
to where RSBTC is worth $31,000 and then
Bitcoin's worth $67,000 and there's no

497
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
ability to quickly balance that liquidity
differential. And the price differential

498
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,000
is something isn't fully complete yet. So
we're getting there. I wish it was faster,

499
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,000
but when you're working with third
parties, I don't know. Sometimes you just

500
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,000
have to wait for your woman to get ready,
right? Pushing it just makes more

501
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,000
problems.

502
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So you have a pretty comprehensive and,
let's say, old school understanding of the

503
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
whole crypto space. Can you tell me, are
there any other multi-chain wallets that

504
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
are open source? I mean, of course, a lot
of hardware wallets are multi-chain. We

505
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
already talked about Keystone.

506
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Oh, I would say Cake is probably one of
the better open source wallets around. It

507
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
creates a, I don't know, a weird
assumption where sometimes it's like

508
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,000
they're fully open source. Sometimes
there's partial ability to view. But the

509
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
most important thing is how are the keys
stored and managed, right? And what are

510
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
the terms of agreement? And you know, the
devil is usually in those details, in my

511
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
opinion, because there are a lot of
products that I'm just going to call them

512
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
spyware. You know, there's no other way to
really put it. They're spyware. They're

513
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
scraping your IP address. If you're
submitting some sort of swap, they have

514
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
the ability to kind of see your order
coming in and act, you know, in front of

515
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
you, which is somewhat manipulative. But
Robinhood is a good example where, you

516
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
know, like as an application to some
degree, it's spyware and it's selling your

517
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
information to Citadel, which is then
front running you, right? That's not an

518
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
ideal assumption. For markets, right? But
you know having the ability I've said this

519
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
many times he who controls order flow is
king and I don't think people fully

520
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
understand how When you have the ability
to get in between the market participant

521
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
in the market you have an asymmetrical
advantage that you can make profitable

522
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
pretty much every time and that's moving
into the crypto space, which is why, you

523
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
know, I would say for best assumptions in
a peer network, stay low, build your own

524
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
transaction, right? Don't allow that order
flow information to be passed around

525
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
before it hits the network.

526
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
It just feels like we're here to promote
Ergo, but if Nautilus was available for

527
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
BTC users and became in some ways uniquely
good because it enables them to engage in

528
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
DeFi. Yeah. then that draws in new
customers that don't necessarily initially

529
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
even need to care about Ergo. All they
care about is, hey, look, this Nautilus

530
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
wallet has a sort of trading tool built
right into it. That's cool. And it's open

531
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
source. And we can sort of figure out that
these guys aren't spyware, right? And then

532
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
they can be promoted like that. And then
suddenly you have access to a huge

533
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
customer base that doesn't immediately
have to think, oh, this is Ergo, let's

534
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
learn about Ergo, but then once they're on
board, then they realize, oh, this is all

535
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
powered by Ergo. Let's learn more about
Ergo and buy some ERG.

536
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I think long term, in order to put more
resources into wallet development, we need

537
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:46,000
to put some form of transaction fee into
that type of wallet. Right. And I think

538
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:52,000
there should be a pretty clear disclaimer
like, hey, you're choosing to be a user

539
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,000
rather than a peer. If you want to not pay
this, you know, here's how you spin up a

540
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,000
node and here's how you become a lower
level in the network. But I think having

541
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,000
that mechanism to incentivize development
would be big. We haven't done that yet

542
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,000
just because there wasn't many options.
And I think that, again, it kind of

543
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,000
doesn't really make sense if you're the
only game in town and it's open source and

544
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,000
you're trying to just bootstrap community
to fee gate it right out of the gate. But

545
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I do think that long term that probably
has value there. in terms of scaling into

546
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,000
new environments and having kind of the
incentive structure for constant support.

547
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:53,000
All right. And by the way, about wallets,
so if you have some feature requests, some

548
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:00,000
ideas in regards with Ergo wallets, yeah,
please create a GitHub issue, so send

549
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:07,000
ideas to me. Yeah, well, it's possible to
add something in the coming months, but we

550
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:14,000
need to consider roadmap.

551
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,000
HQ, maybe you should make a telegram bot
that posts directly to different

552
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,000
repositories for issues. So very normal
people aren't afraid to post comments on

553
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,000
GitHub. If you don't do it, I'll do it.
But you have more time than me.

554
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Now we can have a bot which can maybe
register people issues. But the thing is

555
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
you will have more nonsense in that than
the real issues. Then you have to sort out

556
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
the real issues.

557
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Well, that's where you come in. You can
just sort that out in your free time.

558
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Who says that I have free time?

559
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I mean, you're building all this stuff.
Obviously you have a lot of free time.

560
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
It's not that I have free time. I have
free will. That's a different thing.

561
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Oh boy. Oh, we're at 57:05. We got
another question. Oh, Byron says, who

562
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
chose a meetup outside of snowboard
season? Mission reduction over gliding?

563
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,000
He's right, Joe. Why are we going to
Colorado? Not when there's a lot of snow.

564
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Probably because people will be cold.
It's funny, whenever East Denver happens,

565
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
which is a pretty big conference in
Colorado, every year you have people that

566
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
fly in and then bitch moan and complain
that, oh my God, it's so cold. But it was

567
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
funny, I was there, I think it was two
years ago, where it's like the second day.

568
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
In the mountains, usually you'll feel this
instability in the air, where it's like

569
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
you get these bursts of winds, which means
the pressure is changing. Right. And, you

570
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
know, being from the mountains, you feel
that and you're like, oh, it's going to

571
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
snow. And you look at all of these, you
know, script kiddies from that are wearing

572
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
shorts and flops and you're like, oh, they
have no idea what's coming. And then two

573
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
hours later, it's snowing and everybody's,
you know, freezing. And then, you know,

574
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
afterwards, you're like, oh, it's the
worst experience ever because I went to

575
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
the mountains and I forgot to bring a
coat. So hopefully hopefully we hit the

576
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
season where the leaves start to change,
which in Colorado is its own magic. And

577
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
it's still crisp, but warm enough that you
can go enjoy that.

578
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
You have trees with leaves in Colorado,
not just conifers, evergreens.

579
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Oh yeah. The Aspens. If they're hitting
the point where they're turning gold,

580
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
that's its own magic.

581
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Very nice. Oh, Byron, you're still in
chat. You want to ask your next question

582
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
live? You're still up here if you want to
pop up. That's great.

583
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Oh, put the pressure on me. Okay. Let me
go back to the question. You're talking

584
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
about are intents the same as weakly
confirmed transactions. Because I've been

585
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
seeing intents a lot lately and I also
reviewed the Ergo hack with CBK. So I want

586
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
to know if that's similar to how you're
doing it. Armeanio with the OP_RETURN and

587
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,000
RGB, I don't know what the plus plus is.

588
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Are you talking about RGB plus plus and
intents?

589
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, RGB plus plus. Why
don't you answer that kushti? I wasn't

590
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
following.

591
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:36,000
hackathon CBK yeah so i need ideas
towards intents but so actually i think

592
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Ergo by design so well it's it's not just
intents friendly it's intents oriented

593
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:52,000
right so well you are specifying well, for
following good design patterns, right, so

594
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:00,000
you are specifying only conditions which
do matter, right, and leave the rest to

595
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:08,000
others so that's how swap contracts are
done right and others so that's why

596
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:16,000
they're composable by the way and so on so
i think intents is kind of products of

597
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:24,000
accounts based blockchains like NEAR and
so on. So when they tried to relax what

598
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:32,000
kind of strict contractual descriptions
they have. They come base approach right

599
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:40,000
so that that's kind of relaxation they're
doing and actually it's quite funny so

600
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:48,000
recently I've checked some dark tokens
proposals for Ethereum and here it seems

601
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:56,000
they all are implementing UTXO model
actually and Yeah, I think, well, intents

602
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:04,000
and also that thing from Ethereum, account
abstraction. So they're simply not needed

603
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:12,000
here because they're here since day one.

604
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:29,000
It's kind of, yeah, there's considered
overlap between terminology, right? I

605
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:35,000
think a good way to look at UTXO is it's
like you have spending conditions, right?

606
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:41,000
And spending conditions are in a way an
intent, if that makes sense. versus when

607
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:47,000
you get into the account model, there's
just a larger program path you have to

608
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,000
follow that they're somewhat trying to
simplify and get away from in order for

609
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,000
things to move faster and not execute. So
I think perhaps in UTXO, we should just

610
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:05,000
call them spending conditions, which is
kind of an intent of the transaction.

611
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Yeah, spending conditions, guarding
propositions. So yeah, intents is

612
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:23,000
basically a way to write them where you
can write, well, some minimum rites of

613
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:31,000
spending. But that's what you're usually
doing right here in UTXO programmability.

614
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:39,000
So that's how you are doing things in Ergo
and before in Bitcoin even with more

615
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:47,000
limits. So, yeah, but basically intents I
hear since day one, just under different

616
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:55,000
terminology. Naming, right. Yeah. Well,
we're just following Bitcoin basically.

617
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And yeah, well, account abstractions also.
Yeah, since day one because everything is

618
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:11,000
a contract. We don't have any special kind
of accounts, contracts, whatever. So,

619
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:19,000
well, it's just one type, right?

620
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
To some contract and you take it. Is that
still going to be the same when we convert

621
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
to proof of stake guys in the future?

622
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Someone ban this.

623
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:41,000
But to some degree you could call you
could call every register on Ergo

624
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:47,000
declaring an intent. If that makes sense.
And then, you know how the registers

625
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:53,000
interact is like a contractual basis of
intents. I guess.

626
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Right. So yeah, well, it's also the
question of terminology, right? So what

627
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:11,000
are we doing as a community? So are we
pushing our own or are we following

628
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Bitcoins, right? So are we adopting and
somehow modifying EVMs? So yeah, well,

629
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:27,000
it's... I have a feeling that we are quite
doing all the three things right in

630
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:35,000
discussions, which also does make some
sense. It's hard to get.

631
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Can we start using outputs per
transaction versus TPS?

632
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Yeah, it's hard to find concise consensus
about terminology, even, which is kind of

633
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
crazy. But sometimes, like, I don't know.
Sometimes when marketing leads the space,

634
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
words don't mean anything.

635
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I mean, that's everywhere. Even in
blockchain.

636
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,000
That's everywhere. It's not just in
blockchain, even. It's five companies out

637
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,000
of the same thing, and it's just named
differently. Yeah. So it's, it's, I don't

638
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,000
know, unique terms can dilute the value of
language to some degree. Cause there's a,

639
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
there's, it just lacks concise boundaries
of what it even means. And I don't know,

640
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,000
different language from different projects
sometimes just pretzels my brain. Cause I

641
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,000
don't know, what does this concisely mean
even? And then I have no idea what

642
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
anyone's talking about.

643
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
We got more questions, guys. Let's bang
them out while we can. We've got a few

644
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
more minutes. Thanks so much for turning
on your video, Byron, and asking the

645
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
question.

646
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Yeah. Do we have time? And by the way,
hello, Byron. Happy to see you. We're here

647
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:07,000
as well as other new guys. Guldis, Zed,
Nir, Odi, Karim.

648
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,000
For the viewers of 2021, maybe 2020.

649
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
He means new on zoom Byron he means new
on the zoom.

650
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah, wish he remembers
everybody on your system. Don't worry.

651
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
You're new on the blog, but yeah, well,
please join some calls for more We will

652
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
have more right in coming weeks. Maybe
especially

653
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Yeah, next week we're going to have the
same thing, so that'll be great. Andy's in

654
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
the woods camping for two weeks, so we are
doing this instead of the AMAs. Yep, just

655
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
for two, just for the AMAs.

656
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Yeah, so actually, yeah, but I think it's
a good initiative, right, to have more

657
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
voices for them. Yeah, yeah.

658
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:56,000
100%. You want to answer a few more
questions, guys, or you want to call it?

659
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Joe's like, I could go back to sleep. Now
we got three more questions. Let's bang

660
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
them out. This one's for Joe specifically.
Is Machina Finance an order book DEX or

661
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
will it utilize the existing AMM pools
also?

662
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Either. Neither. It's kind of a design
that it's again it's an old idea that it's

663
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,000
like finally we have some bandwidth for I
would say it's called an order based DEX

664
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:27,000
and so the cool thing about what we're
trying to build is that let's say that

665
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Chris wants to sell an asset right and he
has the ability to create his own local

666
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,000
contract that's offering the limit of the
asset, right? And so then you have this

667
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:45,000
backend that's able to match all of these
local smart contracts and kind of create

668
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:51,000
unification of just these UTXOs around the
chain that are offering different, you

669
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:57,000
know, buy and sell limits, right? So it's
not a book. It's like everybody creates

670
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:03,000
their own pages and then there's a
matching engine in the background. And

671
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:09,000
kind of the cool thing about that is
longer term, it allows this idea for

672
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:15,000
automation of trading, where it's like,
okay, if I want to buy within this range

673
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:21,000
and sell within this range, I can create
local smart contracts to facilitate that.

674
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:27,000
So it's not really a order book, because
usually order books are unified, right, in

675
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:33,000
terms of there's usually one party that's
more or less writing all of the buy and

676
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:39,000
sell orders in a book. It's order based
and it's peer based. And one of the cool

677
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:45,000
things about having a peer based setup
like that is again, you're operating from

678
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:51,000
this low local level where if I create the
sell order and Chris buys from me, you get

679
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:57,000
a peer-to-peer contract interaction rather
than having the bookmaker in the middle.

680
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:03,000
So it's not AMM, it's not order book, it's
kind of this specialized UTXO order base

681
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:09,000
DEX that then you have this ability to
aggregate. And if we open source the

682
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:15,000
aggregator, then everybody can essentially
run the book. if they want to, right? So

683
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:21,000
again, you're kind of removing the central
contract or the central bookmaker, whether

684
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:27,000
it's AMM or the order book, and you're
creating just this ability to create local

685
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:33,000
orders and then match them.

686
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
It's more decentralized than a DEX.

687
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Do you mind if I ask a question? So how
are we validating those? So let's suppose

688
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
that I want to sell one ERG and I want to
sell it for 1.2 USD, right? So I want to

689
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
swap. For example, I am actually working
on something like this on MewFinance

690
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
already because I'm utilizing the same
smart contract, which lets me sell for it

691
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,000
and lets me sell token for anything. So
what I really do is I create order. I tell

692
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,000
that I want to sell this for this much.
And the other party, if they like it, they

693
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,000
can accept it. So what I'm trying to
understand is what is the difference here?

694
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Is this off-chain bot which is running and
matching those orders and publishing them,

695
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
executing them, or it has to be manually
done by the other party to accept the

696
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
offer?

697
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Right now we're working on the backend,
putting together a Rust-based backend to

698
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:43,000
aggregate orders and be essentially the
matching engine. If you want best

699
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,000
assumptions, you're going to want to run
that. And how many people are willing to

700
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,000
do that? Well, that's always kind of the
problem with local hosting and

701
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:01,000
decentralization anyway, but having the
path to be able to create orders and then

702
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:07,000
run your own matching engine is pretty
unique. I don't know if I've seen an

703
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:13,000
application that does that. And it's kind
of neat because at least in UTXO, you

704
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:19,000
know, long-term, it's like, if we could
get that right, it creates this ability to

705
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:25,000
where the entire chain itself is the book.

706
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Yeah, exactly. That's why, because if we
look at the MewMart main contract, it's

707
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
basically that. So yeah, I just wanted to
create a new interface on top of it to

708
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
show it like a DEX.

709
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah, I think long term, that's a really
nice design pattern for UTXO. It's just a

710
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:56,000
question of saying, okay, well, how many
people are actually going to run their

711
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:03,000
aggregator and be their own matching
engine to where they are the bookmaker in

712
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:10,000
a way? I don't know. That's always hard.
Sometimes it's hard to get people to even

713
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:17,000
get off exchanges. But having that path
towards pure, peer-to-peer finance that's

714
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:24,000
just smarter, more performant is always a
good path to try to conceptualize, play

715
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:31,000
with, and then make reality.

716
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I guess we will check it out how many
people will actually use that. So I think

717
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I can run an instance and see if people
are even interested in that.

718
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Yeah, I think long term. I don't know. I
keep coming back to this idea that I've

719
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,000
talked about over the years where it's
like, I think probably for users anyway,

720
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
you need just light wallet that's more
comprehensive. And maybe long-term, we

721
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,000
need some sort of node package. We kind of
saw that to consider, but that's also hard

722
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,000
to build because then you need standards
and contributions and it can be its own

723
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,000
centralizing I don't know.
