1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Okay, so here we are on the computer.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now, I've got my Ergo Mempool website
open, and this is really what it looks

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
like.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now, let me talk you through some of the
things.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here at the top, I just put a temporary
logo here at the top left.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I can probably do a better job at making
it pretty, not really my strong suit.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I've got some buttons. I'm quite keen to
show you guys how these buttons work.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There's a test transaction, so that's
basically if you want to send a test

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
transaction, see it pop up in the mempool.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You can also connect your wallet. So
again, I'll show you guys how that

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
functionality works.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Again, pretty cool. I'm super stoked that
I managed to get it working.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So here at the bottom or just below that
is the block section.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So these are the mining blocks. So on
Ergo, more or less every two minutes,

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
there is a block.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So on the left-hand side here is the
block that is yet to be mined.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The next to it is in purple here, all the
four blocks that have been mined.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So you can see the block numbers
associated to them.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Underneath it, it's showing you the
actual size of the block.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So what you would see here is a typical,
I think the max size of an Ergo block is

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
two megabytes.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So you can see that you just saw the
animation as a block got mined.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So anyway, so if I come back, the size, I
think an Ergo block can hold two

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
megabytes.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So you can sort of get a feel for how it
is utilized or how full the blocks are.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Some of the stuff that I would love to
add in the future is sort of a visual

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
indication around how percentage full a
block is based on some animation.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So that's some stuff that I would like to
do.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Underneath that is the total reward.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now, what I'm showing there at the moment
is a combination of let's call it the

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
subsidy or the block rewards which at
least at this specific point in time is

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
about 15 ERG and then at the bottom is all
of the transaction fees so it's not an

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
awful lot transaction fees for the miners
at the moment, but that's sort of what it

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
is underneath that I'm showing the amount
of transactions within the block and then

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
sort of the time since that block and then
the mining pool and associated or that

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
found that block.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So I've got sort of addresses around what
the mining pools are and then I've got the

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
little logo next to it.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Again on these blocks you can actually go
click on them and it should show you the

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
transactions that make up that specific
block.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The total fees as you probably saw from
my screen. I'm a big fan of the Sigma

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Spaces website so I've got most of my
links pointing to this at the moment until

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I further build out my own type of view of
this information.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So that's sort of what this top section
shows.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Again, some of the cool stuff here is a
little animation. As soon as a block is

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
mined, you can see it sort of shifting
across.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Now, underneath that is the mempool
visualizer.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So this is again, at the moment, it's
showing you the mempool on Ergo.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So for those that don't know, these are
transactions that people have submitted

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
that is yet to be put into the blockchain
or on the ledger.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So they're sort of in limbo here at the
moment until it gets picked up.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hopefully with sub-blocks in the near
future, I'm not exactly sure how this is

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
going to impact this application but I'm
sure I'll figure it out now so some of the

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
stuff that you see in the mempool
visualizer and again I've played around

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
with a lot of things here I actually want
to make it a lot prettier than what it is

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
at the moment I was thinking of tetris
game or some building happening here with

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
the blocks just to give you a little bit
more information, but you can get a view

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
of how many transactions are waiting at
the moment.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You can see that is sort of correlating
to what is in the block.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I've got two types of formats here based
on the size of the block.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So you can see this one is bigger, so 629
bytes versus 630.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You can also do it on value.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So it gives you an idea of how big these
transactions are or how small they are.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So this is the mempool visualizer.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Again, I'd love to make this a little bit
better in the future or make it more fun.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There's another block that literally just
got mined.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Now, what you see at the bottom here,
again, is just these transaction IDs at

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
the bottom.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
These are the transactions that relate to
this.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Again, I can click on any one of these,
then it should open up, again, the Sigma

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Spaces view of that transaction.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's what that does for me at the
moment.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is the main aim of the website or at
least the minimal viable product that I

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
developed in the last couple of days to
get it up, but it literally just shows

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
this button.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
At the bottom here is the link to the
GitHub.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is obviously open source. Anybody
can go ahead and see how bad this is.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Again, I'm not really a developer.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The real developers probably looking at
this thing and saying, oh, this is the

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
worst thing ever, but I'm super proud of
it, created it.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But again, it's not the end, it's really
the start.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But this is the GitHub, this is open
source, the last bit of code I committed

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
earlier today to sort out that block
transition that you see at the top, so

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
make it a little bit smoother.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I also have this page I'll probably take
away once the Ergo hack is done, which is

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
just the presentation section, which I got
AI to go and create this for me.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So it just literally just shows some of
the features and all sorts of fluff

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
associated to the website.

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Again, I probably don't need this much
longer.

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And then there's a donation button.

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So again, that talks to you some of the
functionality of the tool, which I will

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
show you guys next.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay, so let's test some of these
features.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So as I mentioned this is the mempool
visualizer.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So there is a couple of websites
available on Ergo where you can have a

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
look at the mempool.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And they basically just show the section
here that I've got at the bottom.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So at least now you get them in a block
format.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But some of the other cool stuff is what
I wanted to show you guys.

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So what I'm going to try and do is click
on the test transaction here.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's going to say, oh, I need to go and
select the wallet.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So I've built this at least with the
Nautilus integration.

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll talk about some of the tools that I
used.

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But I first need to connect the wallet,
so I'm just going to hit Connect here.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Unfortunately, I've already connected one
of my Nautilus wallets, so it remembers

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
that.

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So it's probably something that I need to
go and look at or file under bugs that I

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
need to clear the cache as soon as you
disconnect from it.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But yes, this is one of my testing
Nautilus wallets.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm going to click on the test
transaction now.

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's going to come up with a small amount
of ERG and then a wallet.

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So you can actually change this wallet
address in case you wanted to send it to

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
some different wallet.

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm just defaulting a wallet. I don't
even think this one is mine, but either

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
way, we're going to send a small amount.

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So I'm going to hit Send Transaction.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's going to build a transaction at the
top. It's going to ask me to sign.

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So it shows you the details. So you can
sort of see exactly how much you're

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
sending.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm going to go and put in a password.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And then I am going to sign it.

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So what that does, you can see there it's
now created a test transaction.

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So if we give it a couple of seconds,
hopefully soon we should see at the back

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
end I've got a couple of APIs.

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So most of the APIs is built in Python.

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So it's going to go and hit the main
explorer and go and try and find all these

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
unconfirmed transactions.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So basically everything that's within the
mempool.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
At the moment, I'm just pointing it to
the main explorer, I guess.

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If I did point it to my own node, it
probably would be a lot faster.

131
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What I do expect here is in the next
second or two, it should go ahead and

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
create a transaction, and I should
actually see it in here.

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Every couple of seconds, that API is
going to go and have a look and see if it

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
finds any new transactions.

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I can force the fact here. So I can go
ahead and refresh.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Again, I'm going to go ahead and do that.

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
At the moment, it's not picked up my
transaction just yet.

138
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So we'll give it a second. And I guess
I'll talk to the other function here.

139
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So what I'm going to do is also donate.
They work very similar.

140
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So I'm just going to go click on this
Donate button here just to show you that

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
while we wait for that transaction to pop
up in here.

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
See if I hit Donate. Again, same type of
thing.

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This is actually definitely one of my
addresses that I know for sure.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So I'm just going to go and put in. I'll
just hit Cancel for a second.

145
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So as you can see, at least that test
transaction is now popping up in the

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
mempool.

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So what you can see here is it is
highlighted here as a gold color within

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
the blocks here.

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
If I hover my mouse, you would see there
is my test transaction.

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You can see it's also labeled it as a
test transaction.

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So it's pretty cool. So it highlights. It
does two things in this visualizer.

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Number one, if it finds a transaction
that you have created, it's going to

153
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
highlight it.

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It will just be this gold color, what
you're seeing here at the moment, or

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
that's what it is.

156
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And it will highlight the transaction in
the list.

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
If it is the test transaction that you've
created, it puts that little, I don't even

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
know what the English word is, that little
probe thing inside of it.

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Now, the donation works basically the
same.

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm just going to go back and donate
myself.

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Also, a small amount, I'm going to hit
Donate.

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's going to build the transaction. It's
going to ask me again to sign that

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
transaction.

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm going to do exactly that.

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Then it's going to submit the transaction
starting with 2E3733 or whatever.

166
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Again, similar thing is we just need to
be a little patient, but that should also

167
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
pop up within the mempool.

168
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So it's pretty cool.

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
At least I am super excited, I know, for
real developers. And I'm not a real

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
developer.

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
By nature, I don't develop in my day job.

172
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I did study a little bit of development
in the past.

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So you can see our previous transaction
got confirmed. Our transaction is gone.

174
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It is now within this block.

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But what you can see is the donation
transaction has popped up in here.

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So it's pretty cool. So it's got a heart
here.

177
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So again, this is just sort of
visualizing that type of thing.

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So again, I think it's super cool that
you can create the app that connects with

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
the Ergo blockchain actually create and
submit transactions.

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So it is pretty cool.

181
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And that's really what the functionality
is looking like at the moment.

182
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So again, I'm not a real developer on a
daily basis.

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I did study a little bit of programming.

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I've got a Bachelor of Science degree in
IT, which had a major in programming in

185
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Java, but it's been 20 years.

186
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I haven't touched a code at least for
work related stuff so I don't code for

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
work but anyway so that's sort of what it
looks like there's a lot of things that

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm hoping that I can improve but at least
for this week's project this is sort of at

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
least what the functionality looks like
and again to recap basically just looks at

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
the mempool gives you some information
around what was the latest blocks who's

191
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
mined how much transactions was in there
what was the fees that's sort of the

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
visual cues again if it detects your
wallet if you've connected your wallet

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
that is it's going to highlight at least
some of the transactions here associated

194
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
to your wallet okay so next up let's talk
about tooling so how did I come up with

195
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
this so no surprise I have used I mean I
just use VS Code.

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So it's within here, I publish it from
GitHub or to GitHub from here.

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
In terms of AI, what AI have I used to
help me create this?

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I definitely use some AI, as I mentioned
before.

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm not really a developer in day to day,
so I'm definitely rusty, but I get the

200
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
general idea.

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Most of the AI, let's call it 90% of the
AI, I've used via continue.

202
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So I've got Ollama installed on my
computer and I host all my own models.

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So as you can see here, if I go to the
model section, the main models that I've

204
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
used is Qwen 2.5 Coder, the 14b model.

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
One of the other ones, I guess it's not
in here, and then let me just drop down so

206
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
you can actually see it, is the DeepSeek
one.

207
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I think the DeepSeek one, at least from
an open model perspective, is probably the

208
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
best one, or at least in my opinion, is
definitely better than Qwen 2.5, but it's

209
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
hard for me to run that.

210
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Now, how it works, it's really cool,
super interesting.

211
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So if I go back and go to last session or
just close this model and just go back to

212
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
chat and then ask it a question.

213
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So if I just start a new question and say
something like, I don't know, how do you

214
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
start a Flask app as an example.

215
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So it's going to use that now.

216
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And if I open up my task manager, you
will see it hit my computer pretty hard.

217
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
First up, you can see it hits my GPU
memory.

218
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So I've got a 7900 XTX.

219
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So it's going to load that up.

220
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
All 24 gigs of VRAM is going to load up
most of that and you can see also my

221
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
system RAM gets used.

222
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So running these models locally, it's
pretty cool like that.

223
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It gives you an answer. It's pretty quick
as well responding.

224
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So I'm a big fan of this.

225
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So 90% of what I've developed, I
basically used Qwen 2.5 for majority of

226
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
the stuff.

227
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
DeepSeek again, I can run, but it maxes
out my PC.

228
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So I can't ask it more than four
questions on the same topic without having

229
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
to restart.

230
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So this computer was obviously not built
for AI related stuff It's more of a gaming

231
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
PC and it's getting old a little bit at
least on the CPU side on the RAM side But

232
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
this is what I've used for the majority of
my AI stuff I also used at least the guys

233
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
in the Sigmanauts mining pool.

234
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
They were raving about how good Claude is
and I don't really want to pay for

235
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
something if I've got a computer and I can
actually use some of these AI features.

236
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But I did use the free version of Claude
a little bit, but probably 90 percent I

237
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
used these self-hosted models via Ollama.

238
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Some other tools that I used on the Ergo
side, I used this dApp connector.

239
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So this is awesome.

240
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
This Nautilus share that is also within
the Ergo documentation.

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So this is fantastic.

242
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Obviously, I use the Ergo documentation
for the APIs.

243
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So that's why I've got majority APIs.

244
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But in terms of getting the wallet
connected in the app, this is what I've

245
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
used.

246
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I spent a lot of time trying to figure
out how to make that work in Python.

247
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's probably where I wasted a lot of
time, but this works.

248
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I did try and use the FleetSDK a little
bit.

249
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
There's a lot of things in here, probably
a lot of things that I don't need to use.

250
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I mainly use the dApp connector.

251
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And the other thing that I did use, which
I think is fantastic, some of the again,

252
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
another miner, he's creating also a
different application around ciphers and

253
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
securing your passwords and seed phrases
and stuff like that.

254
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So he has a guide.

255
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So he helped me get the transaction to
actually build a transaction.

256
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So I got stuck.

257
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I should probably know the UTXO stuff a
little better, but in this example here,

258
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
it's got code of exactly how do you go
about building a transaction so that it

259
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
actually gets picked up.

260
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So this saved me a ton of work.

261
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I don't know how long I spent, probably a
couple of hours trying to get this

262
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
transaction to build or getting it to
build blindly.

263
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I don't know what I needed to do
necessarily.

264
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So this helped me a ton because it shows
you practically around which boxes you

265
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
should be using and which not.

266
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So this was super cool.

267
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So that's again in terms of the some of
the tools on the Ergo site that I use in

268
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
order to make this work.

269
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So again, big thanks to all the guys that
create some of these things.

270
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's easy then for a novice like me just
to go and pick up this dApp connector,

271
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
let's say, and just hook it up to the
site.

272
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So it's awesome like that.

273
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
In terms of, again, the application, I
mean, it's mainly Python, not for any real

274
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
reason.

275
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
As I mentioned, I'm not a programmer by
day, so I'm sure there's better for these

276
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
type of website apps, there's way better
stuff to use.

277
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Again, I'm not in the know of what is the
best thing out there and what I should be

278
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
using and what's the most efficient and
all of those type of stuff.

279
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
This is just easy for me to understand.

280
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I can follow it.

281
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I can do it a little bit by myself
without having to ask AI to create some

282
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
dumb stuff for me.

283
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I can do a lot of this myself.

284
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
That's really what it is.

285
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But again, probably longer term, I need
to go and try and use at least what the

286
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
cool kids are using.

287
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
In terms of hosting, I'm hosting this on
the Flux network.

288
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's pretty cool.

289
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
If I just jump to the dashboard here, I
host some of the other apps that I've

290
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
created also on here.

291
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I've got the ErgoMempool on here as well.

292
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
If I just show you guys what that looks
like, I've got it deployed at the moment.

293
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
With Flux, I mean, you can get a lot of
instances.

294
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I think you can get like 100, but at
least for now, the lowest option that you

295
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
can have is three instances.

296
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Again, it's pretty cool from a
decentralization point of view.

297
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You can also go ahead and manage it here,
so it's sort of what your details are, how

298
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
long are you going to be running it, what
your hardware requirements are.

299
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I didn't give it restrictions, you can
give it geolocking and all sorts of funky

300
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
stuff like that.

301
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Again, this is not really a flux video,
but that's where I've got it hosted at the

302
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
moment.

303
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
In terms of running instances, as I
mentioned, there's there's four at the

304
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
moment.

305
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
There's three in the US and one in Spain
at the moment.

306
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So again, I'm hosting it via Flux.

307
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I've got some Flux. It's pretty cheap.

308
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So that's what I'm using in terms of
hosting.

309
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So that's really what my application
looks like.

310
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So as I mentioned, I'm not really a
developer.

311
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So if any of the developers are watching
this, again, thanks for open-sourcing a

312
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
lot of your stuff so that people like me
can pick it up.

313
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Again, if you're a developer and you
think I'm doing a bad job, please give me

314
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
some pointers, make comments, or give me a
couple of tips.

315
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If you want to help me with some of this
stuff, please reach out and help.

316
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm definitely not going to say no for
any help.

317
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But at least for now, I'm going to try
and build it out a little bit more and

318
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
explore at least some other platforms that
is maybe not Flask / Python related.

319
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But that's really what my app looks like.

320
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It was super fun for the last couple of
days to work with some of the Ergo tooling

321
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
and create something that, at least for
me, I think is super cool.

322
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It visualizes the Ergo mempool and I can
also send an interact and send

323
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
transactions on the Ergo blockchain, which
again, I think is super cool.

324
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But that's really what the Ergo Mempool
project or entry within the Ergo hack

325
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
does.
