1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Music's going, right, kushti?

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I mean, Andy?

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Perfect.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Welcome, everybody, to the first official
community AMA by the Ergo Proof of Work

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
blockchain.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We have quite a showing already.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is fantastic.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We have Grayman, kushti, Blake
Starkenberg, and Nex, Armeanio.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Some people are still waking up, so it
might be a minute before they turn on

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
their cameras, but that's perfectly fine.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
As promised, in the last AMA, we are
going to move this format to what you're

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
seeing now, which is a community chat.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Community AMA, which means you show up,
you ask questions, or you observe, or you

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
get asked questions.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So be prepared for anything if you show
up.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And people asking questions, be prepared
for people not to answer if they don't

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
want to talk.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So, it's a free-for-all, it's an
open-economy system, and this is how we do

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
it, right?

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Just in the Ergo spirit.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So, as promised, hey, kushti, got your
video on.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So, as promised, how you doing, kushti?

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
How's your week been?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's busy, busy.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But everything is well.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So preparing a lot of things in parallel.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, from sub-blocks to some slides.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm going to visit Korean Blockchain Week
and already presenting something to Piers

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
there.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And it seems it will be a big event like
one of the biggest blockchain events

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
globally.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't like those big conferences like
80% commerce rights, 90% like just

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
ordinary crypto web 3 scam somewhat but
yeah well anyway.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
kushti was, I was asking kushti for a
meeting time with Mark trying to organize

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
something.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He's like, I'll be in Korea.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I was like, oh, you're going to North
Korea?

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And he's like, no idiot.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There's a blockchain in South Korea.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Just the biggest one in the world.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
One of the biggest, yeah, and immediately
after it will be Token 2049 in Singapore,

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
but yeah, I'm missing it because yeah,
probably already would be too much.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And basically the same people, I guess.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
All right.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So as promised, guys, as a conversation
starter and to pay respect to the

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
developers and the fact that I don't do
developer update anymore, we're going to

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
bang through a couple of the developer
updates right here.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And kushti, I'd love if you read your own
updates.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That would encourage maybe Anand Vihar to
come on next time and read his updates or

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
other people to come on and read their
updates.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So I'm going to share my screen.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And we will do this, let's see if it
looks okay.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It does look okay, perfect.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
All right, so kushti says, yesterday at 9
a.m., let's chat, please share your

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
updates.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
kushti, you want to take your update
there?

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, so yeah, it's a kind of small font.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah, can you read it?

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Sub-blocks.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Peer-to-peer layer heavily reworked.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Announcements are now done via INV
messages.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Transactions stored in mempool are not
redownloaded.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Only diff testing and polishing things
now.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What's INV messages, kushti?

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah, so we are currently testing it with
Potato.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So there is a network with three peers
and yeah, I'm checking logs all the time

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and improving things.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Often it is stuck, one node or another,
because of banning another node, because

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
messaging to be improved.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, there is a penalization for too
aggressive messaging, but yeah, well, at

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
the same time.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, so some parts are not aggressive
enough.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So yeah, I'm tuning and fixing.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
reworking between the maximum efficiency
but also while working on the enemy spam

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
attacks.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Well, usually it's the parts of the
protocol which developers are not touching

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
at all, they don't love to touch.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So it's

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's especially true for other
blockchains, especially true for Ethereum.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
In Bitcoin there are some updates, but I
think there are a couple of developers

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
that are just working on peer-to-peer
stuff, so it's quite complicated.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But yeah, so after that, after
peer-to-peer, so there will be a review.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And yeah, I'm going to propose already
one toy pull request proposed in the node

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
repository.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And this week, I'm going to propose a
second pull request for review, sub-blocks

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
related, I mean, now in the Sigma SDK
repository.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So, yeah, we are moving forward, yeah.

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
All right, very cool.

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And then you've got an update on
ChainCash basis.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You rework the basis design, off-chain
payments with no need to create anything

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
on chain first.

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah, but wait, also Git Circles.

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
All right, go, go, go, Git Circles.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, so Git Circles is a project to
create community currencies for digital

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
communities, developing communities,
right?

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So the idea is that you write codes and
getting tokens for lines of code or pull

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
requests.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And yeah, well, we already have, so there
are a couple of contributors there.

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And, yeah, well, there is already
functionality to grab pull request data

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
from GitHub.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And, yeah, after the dev chat, one of
contributors reported also on persistence.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They're more or less done.

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So we can start testing it in a few days,
hopefully.

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I mean, do some testing tokens.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
rewarding with it manually for starters.

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And then, yeah, we can start to invite
different open source communities to have

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
the economies on Ergo.

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So, well, we will start with some
repositories contributors are working on.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Those are some fully homomorphic
encryption related repositories, some

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
state of art.

113
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
cutting-edge cryptography stuff.

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But then, yeah, we will probably invite
some infra framework developers in Rust

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and then more.

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So kind of cool and we had some heated
discussions yesterday when tokens are

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
needed, when not.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So I think in this case for open source
communities it makes a lot of sense to

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
have like contribution tokens.

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Even before there is some sponsorship for
open source project, right?

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
There is some economy and actually it
would help with sponsorship as well.

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And so on with providing services to open
source projects by volunteers, well,

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
promotional efforts.

124
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
All right, but then also,

125
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah, well, let's talk further when
tokens are not needed.

126
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So yeah, I think that the current crypto
industry, let's say, so yeah, it's

127
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
creating tokens, means money, where it's
not needed usually, right, but not

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
creating where it's needed.

129
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So it's kind of reversed.

130
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:51,000
to the needs of digital and real-world
economies.

131
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Are you sure?

132
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You got a long one for ChainCash, kushti,
what did you do there?

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Right, so I need to provide some
high-level writing on what's

134
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
what's going on with recent reworks so
currently it's probably technical but

135
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
what's happening so well you know there is
on-chain like free banking with multiple

136
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
backers called ChainCash so it's a kind of
on-chain havala maybe right in certain

137
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
regards

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But also a kind of generic solution to
build different kinds of monetary systems,

139
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
backed and trust-based.

140
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But then, yeah, some time ago I proposed
a lightweight off-chain cache version

141
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:11,000
based on a little bit similar reserve
contract called Basis, where the idea is

142
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:20,000
to have the ability to create IOU nodes
off-chain.

143
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,000
maybe even not backed initially but then
yeah it's possible to create on-chain

144
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
reserve and have redemption right of those
nodes against the reserve and yeah there

145
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
could be multiple reserves and so on but
yeah well

146
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
After considering use cases such as
micropayments and so on, I've discovered

147
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
that the original design is probably not
quite suitable, so I reworked it and now

148
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
it's not about some

149
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Now, but IOU records which are tracked by
minimally trusted tracking agents.

150
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Trackers, right, so it's kind of, I don't
know, like off-channel BitTorrent-like

151
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
design, but for money.

152
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So you choose tracker.

153
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
a reserve holder choosing a tracker,
right, then it's possible to create an

154
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
off-chain cache there and maybe not fully
backed in.

155
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So, yeah, credit is over.

156
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And so on, and yeah, well, after all this
design, I think things like micro

157
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
payments, rewarding peer-to-peer networks,
agent payments are possible.

158
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And yeah, well, I hear some technical
details, but I'm going to write some...

159
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
high-level description, maybe later
today, because I came to this design only

160
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
yesterday.

161
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But yeah, well, it looks okay, and the
contract is done.

162
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And now...

163
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, a high-level description.

164
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, there are some initial contributors
already, so we can do off-chain

165
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
functionalities and then some wallets.

166
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And also integrate these off-chain cache
with some credits and credit LETS.

167
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We can inject those functionalities in
some peer-to-peer networks.

168
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So we can start with Celaut, which is

169
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:02,000
closely related to Ergo already, but then
we can go for other peer-to-peer networks

170
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and replace, well, DP tokens used there
for unclear reasons.

171
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
with just uniform kind of money, right,
created and not via some strict rules,

172
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
well, pretty fine schedule, which is even
worse.

173
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So, yeah.

174
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I have a question about that, about the
track.

175
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Perfect.

176
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah.

177
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Right, right, right.

178
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're proposing to create a system of,
like you said, free banking.

179
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So cash systems that are based on banks,
but in this case, unlike the old system,

180
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
where you just had to trust the banker
that they had a certain amount of gold,

181
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
you're talking about a system where you
could even have fractional reserve lending

182
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
or cash issuance.

183
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
but that those fractional reserves would
be transparent, not just to the person

184
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
who's taking the loan or the cash, but
also the vendor that's accepting it in

185
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
trade.

186
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And then going back to the bank, is this
basically like free banking except you

187
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
have to wear a pin on your lapel that says
how much your reserve is and whether

188
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
you're fully collateralized?

189
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Is that what you're aiming for?

190
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So the idea of tracker is to be like a
ledger keeper, right?

191
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But no more so off-chain ledger records
keeper.

192
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So all the records are signed, right?

193
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So for example, if you are sending me
money,

194
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:07,000
you are signing an IOU statement, then
you need to hold it.

195
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
If a tracker is disappearing, for
example, then still all the records are

196
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
redeemable on-chain, and the tracker
cannot still move, well, he cannot forge

197
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
your signature.

198
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Right, so then, yeah, well, if it's, if
tracker is disappearing, right, then yeah,

199
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:41,000
well, the latest snapshot of its state
committed on the blockchain can be used

200
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:49,000
for redemptions, right, so you can use,
you can lose money

201
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So since the last update, right, maybe a
few minutes, I don't know, one hour.

202
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But yeah, well, you can use records from
the latest snapshot still, right.

203
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And then it can be improved in many ways,
like you can have federated tracker.

204
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
you can replace it with some sidechain
even and so on.

205
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's more or less like BitTorrent in this
regard because for BitTorrent also a lot

206
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
of more secure options were proposed but
usually just centralized gatekeepers have

207
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
been used.

208
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Is there going to be a standard note?

209
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I heard you a while back or maybe it was
in one of the chats talking about having

210
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
pegged to silver, potentially, a small
amount of silver.

211
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah, well, the idea is, but so pegging
is the question of a unit of account,

212
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
right?

213
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So I think I can change cash to use gold
here.

214
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't know, maybe silver, but why
silver?

215
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So I think gold is kind of more
universal, right, in this regard as a unit

216
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
of account.

217
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I mean, maybe it's a bit exotic in
comparison with, well, USD or Euro, but

218
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
yeah, well, it's most stable.

219
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I can tell you why I think the answer
should be silver.

220
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Because gold is the unit of account for
central banks.

221
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And that's appropriate for really large
scale transactions.

222
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But the beauty of ChainCash is that it's
more about localized economies and

223
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
currencies.

224
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And historically, that's been tied to
silver.

225
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And it's true, silver is also part of a
global market.

226
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And that's part of the reason why it
fluctuates in value so much.

227
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But if you're talking about going back to
sort of a free banking approach, which it

228
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
sounds like you are, then silver is
usually the currency of the people,

229
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
especially if you're trading services.

230
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Goods is another matter because the
inputs are fairly fixed in cost and

231
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
there's the question of how many middlemen
between

232
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
you the buyer and how it got to you, but
services are directly provided by the

233
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
person.

234
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So when you're trading services, having
the fundamental unit be something like

235
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
silver is useful because it's, you could
easily redeem it in person without relying

236
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
on the chain.

237
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So let's say you have an under
collateralized bank and people are still

238
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
trading it because it's useful.

239
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
but then there's some sort of a run on
that bank, you could still redeem the

240
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
uncovered ones in physical silver if you
have that around.

241
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And Americans have a lot of physical
silver around.

242
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
That's interesting.

243
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So yeah, in the community setting, yeah,
you may have even tokenized silver, right,

244
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
of some trusted local provider.

245
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And yeah, well, pay with digital

246
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
IOU records which are backed by that
silver.

247
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So yeah in this regard it's the same yeah
for free banking kind of system like

248
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
ChainCash but yeah with no multiple
reserves for now but yeah well like in

249
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,000
ChainCash you can do mutual credit
clearing well even fully off-chain

250
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
right but yeah also between different
reserves yeah I think this would be

251
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
possible but yeah I need to write down
details but yeah it's interesting I mean

252
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
but how popular can it be to have like I
know so small communities trading

253
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
digitally

254
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:29,000
against, tokenized, silver, reserves,
some local reserves.

255
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And that's, that's, that's a question.

256
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Do you think it could be popular?

257
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It already happens with farmers markets
and all sorts of other local economies.

258
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Oh, that's interesting.

259
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah.

260
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So America had silver coinage up until
1964 was the last year.

261
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So, there's just an enormous amount of it
sitting around around, 2 billion ounces

262
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
worth, one to two.

263
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So, and already denominated, I mean,
they're a little bit worn, but they're

264
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
still tradable and recognizable.

265
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
So it's just sitting around.

266
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
There's an enormous amount of,

267
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
a latent capital that is in motion.

268
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It is liquid, not very liquid.

269
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Not everybody knows about this, but
certainly people that give a shit do.

270
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Usually it's used for tax evasion if
we're being real about it.

271
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So people are, instead of horse trading
goods and services, they're pricing them

272
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
in silver coinage.

273
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
There was even a guy out in Arizona that
tried to pay his employees in gold and

274
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
silver, but that was a bridge too far for
the IRS and they nailed him because he

275
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
started screwing around with employment
taxes.

276
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
All right.

277
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Is he even concerned though, gray man,
with silver or even gold with too many

278
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
paper claims?

279
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
on the underlying asset isn't that the
main issue in the validity of it now is

280
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
what ChainCash provides is like, Oh, we
can verify the underlying claims on asset.

281
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah.

282
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Transparent to everyone.

283
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah.

284
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yeah.

285
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yeah.

286
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So if you golf with your banker, right in
the old days, you could be sure that if

287
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
they were under collateralized, that you
would be one of the ones doing the bank

288
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
run happened that could get your silver or
gold out.

289
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and somebody else would be left holding
the sorry, we're bankrupt note.

290
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But in this case, everybody knows and
there's no, right?

291
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's sort of broadcast what the level of
collateralization and that's done, I

292
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
guess, through these trackers and people
can either bump that up or people can

293
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
discount the value of the notes that are
sold based on under collateralized banks.

294
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
That's what happened a lot in the free
banking era.

295
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
That was based mostly on the difficulty
of redemption.

296
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The further away you got from the bank
that was issuing the notes that were

297
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
theoretically backed by the gold, the less
valuable they were for the vendor that was

298
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
accepting them in the market, because
they'd ultimately either have to cart them

299
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
back to that bank themselves and get the
gold for it, or they'd have to pass them

300
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
off to somebody else, and that person's
also going to discount it.

301
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So in this case, you don't have that
problem, but you do have the issue that

302
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
suddenly everybody gets to know which
bank, no matter where it is, is

303
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
collateralized to what extent.

304
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And if you really want to be safe, I
guess you're going to stick with SigmaUSD

305
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
or Blue On or what have you, because
they're over-collateralized.

306
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But the advantage of this type of system
is that it allows you to have a lot more

307
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
money on the end, a lot more liquidity.

308
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
because it's based on the trust of the
local people that are involved in it.

309
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And so we notice, I really think it's the
only way out of the over collateralized

310
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
stable coin and still have it be
algorithmic.

311
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Otherwise you have to rely on these, on
people, right?

312
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
On Tether.

313
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Tether tells you that they have a certain
amount of bonds and Bitcoin and everything

314
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
else to back up the Tether node, but
effectively they're just a bank

315
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And this new act that came out recently
effectively tells them that they have to

316
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
be fully collateralized banks.

317
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But you still just have to trust that
that's the case.

318
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And theoretically, the regulators are now
going to go and investigate and make sure

319
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
that's the case.

320
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
But that's not very capital efficient.

321
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And all of the banks are creating their
own stablecoins because of this new

322
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
approach.

323
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But that's not going to stop them from
trying to issue dollars the normal way

324
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
because that's how they'd rather do it.

325
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And that's much more lucrative for them
because they get to print money out of

326
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
thin air and collect interest on it.

327
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So they're going to want to do that and
not use the stable coins.

328
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But if we want to do something that's on
chain and has that same level of power,

329
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
the power to print money out of thin air
confidence, that comes from credit.

330
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And that's essentially what

331
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
ChainCash is, it gives you the
possibility to have under collateralized

332
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
credit arrangements on chain and have
people be able to ascertain what level of

333
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
trust they should provide that.

334
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So I think it's the most exciting thing
going on, not just in Ergo, but in crypto

335
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
in general.

336
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I don't know if anybody else is even
contemplating this type of thing.

337
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
They're all worried about trying to get
USDC or USDT on their chain.

338
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And I'm just sort of like, why pollute
your chain with a censored centralized

339
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
crap?

340
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Are we trying to get away from that?

341
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
If that's the goal, why not just do it
all on a centralized exchange anyway?

342
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You can get USDT on Coinbase, no problem.

343
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So if you've already given up on the idea
of crypto, just go with Coinbase.

344
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Kind of pointless, but that's what a lot
of people do.

345
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yeah, so ChainCash is fully on-chain,
right?

346
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So you see the collateralization level
on-chain.

347
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So here with off-chain scheme basis,
right?

348
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So the concern is that with using
ChainCash, so in the first place, it's not

349
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
quite convenient for micro payments, but
yeah, you need to pay on-chain fees,

350
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
right?

351
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
that people need to get to blockchain
Ergo Zone.

352
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So here with off-chain, so people can be
onboarded immediately, right?

353
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
As well, especially for credit, for
example.

354
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
if you are joining some services, like
Celaut, for example, so it's kind of like

355
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Docker on a peer-to-peer, right?

356
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So it's a peer-to-peer computing network
where you can get some computing

357
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
resources, right?

358
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And you can get credit like in
BitTorrent, you are getting

359
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:21,000
some data to download like I don't know
one gigabyte right before the need to

360
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:32,000
share in return then yeah here you can get
like 10 minutes worth of CPU hour

361
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
writes for for your tasks without so they
need to know about their go blockchain and

362
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
so on.

363
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Right.

364
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So for for digital economies, that would
be better.

365
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And that would be how can we get a lot of

366
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
People actually are onboarded, right?

367
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So just via seamless experience with
using something, creating credit and then,

368
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
yeah, they need to pay after.

369
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Then, yeah, in the same way you can use
off-chain cash for agent-to-agent

370
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
economies, right?

371
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Now quite popular topic because of, yeah,
and so on.

372
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But yeah, you can use it also for like
retail payments, community consists and so

373
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
on.

374
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And, yeah, well, this silver case is
interesting, so I can maybe write a

375
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
document how such system can be
implemented.

376
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And then, yeah, so with off-chain cache,
you need to trust

377
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
tracker right to get collateralization
level.

378
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So you have reserves on chain, right?

379
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
So here the bank functionality split,
right?

380
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So you have reserves, one party and
ledger keeping, IOU records keeping by

381
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
another party, right?

382
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Doing it off chain.

383
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
But yeah, well, there are a lot of things
you can do here, like doing a federated

384
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
trick, right?

385
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So having multiple people tracking a
collateralization level, like Oracle pools

386
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
are done, for example.

387
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
You can, or wasn't even right, then you
can do merged mine sidechain even, maybe

388
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
some roll-up constructions, right?

389
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So you can get some on-chain guarantees
even, but such constructions would be a

390
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
little complicated.

391
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,000
for tests to start with just simple
designs so it's just a component in the

392
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:58,000
system the tracking channel and then for
silver we can write some doc for community

393
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:06,000
how to tokenize silver and you do
community trading against it.

394
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
What do you think about that, Grayman?

395
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I mean, we can talk about different
things like security, well, attack vectors

396
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and so on for a long time.

397
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
But I think if there is some more or less
good solution, it's better to try to do

398
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
some small scale experiments with that and
then see how to improve things that makes

399
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
a lot of sense.

400
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Instead of building enormously complex
from day one, it gets feedback maybe not

401
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:04,000
so positive after a few years.

402
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Maybe, yeah, well, also some complexities
are not really needed in many cases.

403
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Right, so yeah, it all depends on use
case, so yeah, but it's better to get on

404
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
them as soon as possible, I guess.

405
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So, what do you think, guys?

406
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I think it's a very interesting work in
progress, but there's probably other stuff

407
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
on the on the dev

408
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
update list.

409
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Right, right, right.

410
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So yeah, QX, can we get back to the dev
updates?

411
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Yeah, they've got one or two more, I
think.

412
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
This one's really cool.

413
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Right here, Neetram is working back on
their open source hardware wallet, right?

414
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Is that what I'm seeing, the poor man's
wallet?

415
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Yes, so it's DIY hardware wallets which
you can assemble at home and yeah, well,

416
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:15,000
it's super cheap and also if you order
components and assemble at home you

417
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
are not a possible subject to data leak,
right?

418
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Ledger is coming periodically.

419
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And also, if you have such device
somewhere at your home, then a thief, for

420
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:39,000
example, cannot easily recognize that this
is hardware wallet, right, unlike Ledger.

421
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So the problem with Ledger

422
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
From some big holders, the problem that
I've heard is that it is easily

423
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
recognizable, right, that you have a
Bitcoin wallet and then thieves can target

424
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
it specifically.

425
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
But you can 3D print any case for this,
because you make it look like a calculator

426
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
or something.

427
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah, or maybe, I don't know, Sega Mega
Drive cartridge, something like that.

428
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
That might be valuable, kushti.

429
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Yeah, these days probably, yeah.

430
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Well, that's awesome.

431
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
This is great.

432
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Let's see.

433
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Yeah, because he entered the hackathon
with his original idea, I believe, right?

434
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yeah.

435
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yeah, some Ergo hack three or four,
something like that.

436
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Then, yeah, we discussed MCP.

437
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You were talking about MCP servers,
right, and AI.

438
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Yeah, so currently I'm trying all those
things for different tasks.

439
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So for core development, yeah, well,
results are not satisfiable at all.

440
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
So, yeah, even tests are hard to
generate.

441
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:08,000
For non-testing codes I'm not allowing
for anything but comments to be generated

442
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:18,000
by LLMs because it's always tricky to
check the hallucinations when it's a kind

443
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:28,000
of complex thing.

444
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:39,000
in regards with this base implementation
and so what we can get tests for contracts

445
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:50,000
right maybe off-chain bots quite quickly
and so on so yeah the idea is to get some

446
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:01,000
specialized MCP for building applications
on Ergo right with LMs quicker

447
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah, speaking of that, the thing we set
up for CodeUTXO for ErgoHack with MCP

448
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:21,000
servers, I'm starting to at least develop
half of that for our work here.

449
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
We got some pretty cool things, a couple
of models out already that are seemingly

450
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
helping students.

451
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
So no use for an MCP server yet in that
AI that we're using, but we'll see.

452
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
how it would apply with non-blockchain
things would be interesting for sure.

453
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
What else?

454
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I didn't write in the update but we've
got three more infrastructure peers that

455
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,000
have signed up and we've got the three
machines.

456
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
That's one for Jemai.

457
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
There's one for Satoshi.

458
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And Lucas is going to run in for it as
well.

459
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So these machines will ship out for those
three guys today or tomorrow.

460
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
They've got a base installed with Ubuntu
and then they go through the schooling of

461
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
setting up the Ergo Explorer node and all
that good stuff.

462
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And then we'll hook them on to the load
balancer and we'll spread our reach even

463
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
further.

464
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
We're going to have really good USA
coverage, guys, where we need some more

465
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Europe or Middle Eastern or Asian
coverage.

466
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It would be nice to have those load
balancers in there.

467
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
So if you're in those parts and you want
to join the Ergo InfraDAO, please hop on.

468
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Depending on what hardware you have, work
with us.

469
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And if we have some more extras of these
things, we can send them out to you as

470
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
well.

471
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But ping us and chat.

472
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Talk to us.

473
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
More than Merrier for this kind of
project.

474
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
What else we got?

475
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Joe, I see you're nodding with your
camera on, your coffee's full.

476
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Hopefully your bladder's empty and you're
ready to chat.

477
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Let's see, with Rosen, we've been going
through the process of integrating the

478
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
runes build into the watcher and guard
modules, setting up a test environment to

479
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
where then we'll spend a while running
unit tests and end tests, try to break

480
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
what we build before we release it.

481
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
That's always the most important

482
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
like round of building something, but
it's also like the least appreciated in

483
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
the crypto space where, you know, everyone
says when, when, when, when, when.

484
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And it's like, no, you just need full
coverage and testing.

485
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:48,000
So we'll go through that, playing around
in terms of how to potentially take kind

486
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
of how we're embedding metadata on Bitcoin
to support the Rosen bridge standard.

487
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,000
and seeing what the capacity is to kind
of extend that, right?

488
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And it's kind of unique to think about,
you know, potentially we could create kind

489
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
of our own standard for color coins on
Bitcoin, which I don't know, maybe that's

490
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
kind of old fashioned in terms of like,

491
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I guess we're cryptos today, generally,
but an example would be you could

492
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
potentially wrap ERG as a rune or wrap
Dexy Gold as a rune and potentially get

493
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,000
some access to some of the infrastructure
on Bitcoin, such as Lightning, depending

494
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
on what other builds come up with.

495
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Not one-to-one, you could wrap any amount
of ERG into a single rune essentially,

496
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
right?

497
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah, I think it'd probably be smart to
handle it the same as how we currently

498
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
handle wrapping assets, right?

499
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Because that's something we already do.

500
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
To where it would be more like Rosen
supported for external assets.

501
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And then there's the potential to try to
create some sort of generalized tool.

502
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Maybe two of them, one for general
purpose use and one of them more for

503
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
specialized.

504
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
use that says, okay, if we can create a
unit of account and then we can attach

505
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
metadata to that unit of account, how can
we potentially see unique assets coming

506
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
onto the Bitcoin network?

507
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I do think long-term, there's probably a
certain use case for the infrastructure

508
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
that's being built on top of Bitcoin.

509
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I'd say right now, Lightning is probably
ahead in terms of adoption.

510
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I do believe, at least at first pass,
Lightning would be able to support that.

511
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Then it's like you have these payment
channels on top of Bitcoin and you kind of

512
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
create...

513
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
let's say a wrapped asset or some sort of
synthetic, or let's say I wrote an article

514
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
a while ago where it's like, could you
have gold in a vault and say, OK, we're

515
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
going to tokenize this and have metadata
attached to where's the vault, how much is

516
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
in it, et cetera, et cetera, perhaps even
how do I audit this, and then throw it

517
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
into a payment channel and make it more

518
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
fungible was like a form of payment.

519
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
So thinking about that, you know, the
question is like, okay, standardized input

520
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
fields, you know, there's certain metadata
standards, depending on where you are in

521
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
the world, or like regulated assets,
anyways, and then it's question how big

522
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
would that be?

523
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
How do you

524
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
and I'll create the right input fields
and then basically translate it, hexify

525
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
it, chunk it across UTXOs.

526
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It meant something that is kind of unique
for Bitcoin, where you have some sort of

527
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
token standard.

528
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's been like a thought journey still.

529
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Feasibility costs, et cetera, is not
really locked in yet, but interesting

530
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
nonetheless.

531
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
We also have gone through the application
process for this round of catalyst

532
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
funding.

533
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I think right now they're in community
reviews.

534
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
To be honest, the Rosen submissions are
actually a little bit boring because we've

535
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
already built an open standard.

536
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
which is to some degree like I think a
big advantage because it's like okay well

537
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
here's the cookbook or standards that
we're gonna you know build with right so

538
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
there's there's a certain like I don't
know transparency and expectation of

539
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
delivery but it's also a little bit less
sexy because it's like you know it's a

540
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
known known right versus sometimes there's
the ability to like upsell and market

541
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
things versus just have like

542
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
This is our technical documentation and
we're going to go through that and add

543
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
this and then add that and then add that.

544
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Let's see with.

545
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Rosen, we're also working on updating
kind of to the Pandora testnet.

546
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It's been some work there, working on
creating an updated version of Ergo

547
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Multi-Sig.

548
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
That's hopefully a little bit more
performant.

549
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Yeah, Lithos is just in the same test,
test, test, test, test, test, test, test,

550
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
test, test, which is like the least

551
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I don't know, least sexy marketing time
for building a product probably, right?

552
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
But also practically the most important
in terms of security coverage.

553
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
You know, understanding what can break
and where and how and trying to mitigate

554
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
that.

555
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Also, I know that there's some work being
done for Machina Finance, which is kind of

556
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:14,000
a P2P grid trading framework.

557
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
A lot of these were kind of

558
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I don't know, lined up to deliver
hopefully October, maybe November.

559
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I say that and then I regret saying that
because when you're in testing, what

560
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
matters is what's in front of you, right?

561
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
But we, at least have some sort of a goal
that we're going to do a meetup in

562
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Colorado.

563
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I need to like sync with, Andre coming up
here, to make sure that everything's

564
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
smooth, right?

565
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Looking forward to that, but hopefully
when we get to the point, you know, we can

566
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
show some MVPs, try to throw up some test
nets,

567
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
kind of have some practical example of,
you know, what we've been building and

568
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
talking about for a while.

569
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
So that'd be fun.

570
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
That would be fun.

571
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I have this for the next every, every
week for the next four or five weeks, I'm

572
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
announcing the speakers, even though I
already announced them, but doing a

573
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
feature read on them.

574
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
So Joe was already announced last week as
the welcoming opener.

575
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Yeah.

576
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Yeah, so I think next one's going to be
AdonBR that we'll post today or tomorrow

577
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
to promote that as well.

578
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
But if you guys haven't bought tickets
to, I mean, there's no tickets to buy.

579
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
If you guys haven't bought your plane
ticket or your Airbnb or your hotel, you

580
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
know, they only get more expensive, that's
for sure.

581
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So, and also pop chat if there are other
people going.

582
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
There's ways to save as well by joining
hotels or

583
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Sharing your Airbnb's.

584
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I mean you might wake up in a ice bath
with a scar over your kidney, but But hey,

585
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
you know, it might be worth the same a few
bucks to room with somebody Yeah What's

586
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,000
that You can't camp outside.

587
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I don't know Colorado Springs other tent
fortresses there Joe Yeah, I'm sure

588
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Well, I'm sure it depends on what you
mean by camp.

589
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
The space is in downtown, so there are
people camping around there, but I don't

590
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
know if they're good bedfellows, so to
speak.

591
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
You know, but I'm sure I'm sure there are
there are places to camp in and around the

592
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
general area The question is just like how
close and I don't know infrastructure,

593
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
right?

594
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Yeah, I've also been I've also been
talking to Chris Ray at one point he

595
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
proposed You know just trying to put
together like dinner like that's more

596
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
We're holding them to that, Joe.

597
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
We are holding them to that.

598
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

599
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
We do have at least some facilities there
to where if you wanted to push out some

600
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
food, it's possible.

601
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
When will they kick us out of the hall,
Joe?

602
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Oh, I have the keys, buddy.

603
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Perfect.

604
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I don't know.

605
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,000
At one point he wanted to try to do like
Korean barbecue, but then the question

606
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
there is like basically electricity
logistics.

607
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And I don't know what kind of efforts,
you know, he's talking about.

608
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Using with all that we do.

609
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I mean we do have there is like a
dedicated kitchen there that that's fairly

610
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
large so you know, it might be better to
go more old-fashioned than like Korean

611
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
barbecue skillet, but I Need to talk to
him to be honest But anyway, but I think

612
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
that it's nice to break bread with people,
you know, I have things a little bit more

613
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
p2p like and sharing that'd be cool

614
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
No, it's gonna be a lot of fun.

615
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Yeah.

616
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Tyler, you just spoke about something in
a comment in Zoom right here that I talked

617
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
a little bit about last week that I want
to try to.

618
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
So Tyler, if you want to say it in
person, go for it, Tyler.

619
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
You want me to read your question?

620
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yeah, hey guys.

621
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:27,000
So I've been with Ergo and Crypto since
like 2021, January or so.

622
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
and i've always been interested in
building something but I get like I hit a

623
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
wall and I can't understand how to like
connect the front end with the back end to

624
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
the to the blockchain and all that stuff
so I recently started going back to

625
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
college at community college to do some
software development and hopefully like

626
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
bridge some gaps with apis and the
databases and how it all works and stuff

627
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,000
and i was just thinking of if somebody
else is already working on something or

628
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,000
eventually as i like bridge my gaps i can
start building dApps and like give more

629
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,000
examples of how it all connects and like
make videos maybe just to get more people

630
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,000
building on the on train oh that's awesome
that's a great idea and you mentioned DECO

631
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
in there as well i i miss DECO DECO was
fantastic

632
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I was there for DECO for a little bit.

633
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:36,000
My instructor was Key and I haven't heard
from him since that was over.

634
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So I'm not sure.

635
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
But I hope you still are.

636
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
He's around.

637
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Yeah, so last time I've seen him like a
few days ago, probably, so he's appearing

638
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
in the chats regularly.

639
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
The main chat, usually for some reason.

640
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Not the dev chat.

641
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
But yeah, he's around.

642
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And so what are you looking for?

643
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
So do you want to develop some front end?

644
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Or do you want to understand how to
connect?

645
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I'm really interested in full stack.

646
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Trying to understand.

647
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Yeah, yeah, so I think maybe there is
need to remind about different tools and

648
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
approach.

649
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
But yeah, we have a lot of open source
applications also, right, where it can be

650
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
seen.

651
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,000
So, well, my idea, well, was maybe Mark
have done that to feed LLM with different

652
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,000
open source applications.

653
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
We already have examples, right?

654
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And then, yeah, well, such things can be
shown by LM, even.

655
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:05,000
QX, do you know the state of the MCP
there?

656
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
So the MCPs that we set up on CodeUTXO
are just essentially targeting the APIs

657
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
for...

658
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Some trading stuff, right?

659
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Blockchain, yeah, you got it.

660
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
So you can say, give me the historical
price for the last 30 days, graph it in a

661
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
little graph for me, that kind of thing.

662
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Who's a wallet holder here this so it's
really good tooling for like let's say a

663
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
project owner Who doesn't know code and
they want to airdrop to their people?

664
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
They can get a list of all their holders
of the token and that kind of thing So

665
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
that's the way the MCP works right there,
but that being said Tyler about DECO

666
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Something that I'm doing here on campus
already that students really like and I

667
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
think would be amazing with the amount of
content we have on Ergo that is we take

668
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
the videos and

669
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And we ingest them into AI so that they
create really nice subtitle files, right?

670
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And then I run it through a script to
timestamp YouTube bookmarks in those

671
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
subtitle files.

672
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
We add all that data to a knowledge base
on WebUI.

673
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
You don't even have to use MCP for this,
kushti.

674
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
And then you ingest in the knowledge base
as well.

675
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
You can hard code it, but you can link to
specific projects already in Ergo.

676
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
So then, Tyler, you ask the question, you
say, hey, I'm having trouble connecting

677
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
this to this.

678
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
How do I fix this?

679
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
So the AI will automatically look through
the knowledge base.

680
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
It'll look through every single DECO
video that we put on there.

681
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And it can read the subtitle file.

682
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So it'll look through it and it'll say,
OK, here's how you do this.

683
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
And oh, here is minute 75 in DECO lesson
number five.

684
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Click it, and it takes you right

685
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
bookmark that YouTube.

686
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
So that's my project after we get up and
going is to ingest all those video SRT

687
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
files, timestamps into a knowledge base
and then make it available to all of Ergo

688
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
because I'll run it on a local 3090 with
like llama or deep seek or something like

689
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
that which can run on our own GPU, not
chat GPT.

690
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
That's it.

691
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
So if you want to help out with that,
Tyler, where we're adjusting and you're

692
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
finding videos that are relevant and
you're adding video as well.

693
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And also, you know, being the gatekeeper
for that all.

694
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Yeah, that'd be that'd be great if you
want to join in that kind of thing.

695
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
But not until after the infra.

696
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I got it.

697
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
We got to push that.

698
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
If you want to start it now, that's fine,
too.

699
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Yeah, because I I do pretty good at I do
like reading documentation, but I

700
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
definitely learn faster And I like the
videos like watching your Rosen watcher

701
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
helped me a lot like get that set up and
then using AI to like kind of ask

702
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
questions like hey, I tried this but it's
like not working How do I get it to what

703
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
did I do wrong?

704
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
And then it'll like see my errors or
something

705
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Now imagine watching, pinging an AI bot
that specific task in mind was knowing

706
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:08,000
that you're developing on Ergo and knowing
all the documentation of Ergo.

707
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
So its questions are not searching the
whole web essentially and knows that it's

708
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
focused just on Ergo to help you solve
those problems on Ergo.

709
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
So it makes a world of difference to
context does.

710
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Yeah, that's why we need for specific
MCP, right, for Ergo development.

711
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And yeah, well, maybe some tutorials as
well, like what are typical parts of the

712
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:39,000
app, right, like off-chain backend.

713
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:47,000
A little while ago, maybe a few months
ago, kushti said,

714
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
like most of the code is off-chain
anyways and you just need a little bit to

715
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
connect the chain when there's a
transaction.

716
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
That part having difficulty connecting.

717
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah, so from my experience, yeah, by
number of codes, so yeah, off-chain is

718
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
like 20 times.

719
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:18,000
well more code so even more right so yeah
that's that's an interesting topic i'm

720
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:27,000
also thinking a lot these days like how to
organize development because we have

721
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:34,000
done over the last six years like tens of
different frameworks right on different

722
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:41,000
levels so yeah now it's it's time to
manage all that stuff right so to organize

723
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:48,000
some map of all those tooling and how to
use it and yeah well

724
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:59,000
to employ artificial intelligence, LLM
tools, right?

725
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
So, yeah, let's continue.

726
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:09,000
The developers group, are you there?

727
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Tyler, are you in the development chat?

728
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Telegram or Discord?

729
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Development channel in Discord?

730
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Ergo-developers group in Telegram, are
you there?

731
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Yeah.

732
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Yeah.

733
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Yeah.

734
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
So, so please ping me and let's continue.

735
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Yeah.

736
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Okay.

737
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
So yeah, let's do something in this space
because yeah, well, it's, it's, it's much

738
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
needed.

739
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
So yeah, if, if you can provide feedback
to other CIT, it would be awesome.

740
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Right.

741
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
So we can use this guidance to improve
things.

742
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
All the way.

743
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
All right, guys.

744
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Well, it's 10 o'clock.

745
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
We got, let's end it so we have more to
talk about next week.

746
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
We can't blow it all in one shot, boys.

747
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
All right.

748
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Then maybe Mark will be back next week,
too.

749
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
But one quick announcement before we go.

750
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:07,000
In two days, Cyberverse is shutting down
for a huge rebuild.

751
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And it's going to take 30 days, it sounds
like, to do the rebuild.

752
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Yeah, 30 days.

753
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
So Hero and Pixel are going to be doing a
lot of late nights to revamp a lot of the

754
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
game, it looks like, and bring some big
things further.

755
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I don't know if it'll be a re-release or
not, but it'll definitely be a new opening

756
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
and new things in 30 days.

757
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
So excited to see that.

758
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
So play your little hearts out for two
more days.

759
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
If you want to get your cyber tokens out
of the game, they say pull it out because

760
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
you won't have access to the game to pull
them out of your in-game wallet.

761
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
But other than that, it'll be looking
forward to what they're coming up with.

762
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
But that being said,

763
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Thanks everybody for joining this first
official community AMA.

764
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
It was great, fantastic.

765
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Yeah, it was awesome actually.

766
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
It's good to have free participation and
hear different voices and different needs

767
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
and different opinions.

768
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Beats making videos in the basement, let
me tell you.

769
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Wait, you're in your basement already,
Joe.

770
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
You're still in your basement.

771
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Yeah, so what color is your lightsaber
over there?

772
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
This is purple.

773
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Purple.

774
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I don't know what that means, but I was
impressed.

775
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I did the Disney tour thing where they
take you into the dark room and you build

776
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
your own lightsaber kind of thing.

777
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
It was fun.

778
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
It's good to pretend sometimes, you know?

779
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
All right, with that, everybody, thanks
so much for joining.

780
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Ciao, everybody.

781
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Alright everyone, bye.

782
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Have a good one.
