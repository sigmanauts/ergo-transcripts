1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Cool, cool.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey, welcome, everybody. We're just going
to be going over Why Mine Ergo? A guide to

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
profitability, sustainability. Probably a
lot of this stuff you're very familiar

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
with, but we're just going to go through
it at a high level, as well as talk about

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Sigmonauts mining pool.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Cool. And so what we're going to cover
today is understanding Ergo, why it

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
matters, the basics of mining, the
Autolykos algorithm, the technical setups

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
- so setting up the rig, the design of the
rig, heat and power - as well as the

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
economics, so costs, breaking even,
various analysis, emission schedule

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
impacts, and then as well as the
Sigmonauts mining pool.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So who is this for? We have whoever's new
to crypto, experienced miners, maybe

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
post-ETH merge. I think generally if
you're interested in crypto, it's probably

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
worth looking into proof of work and then
at a minimum maybe potentially even mining

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
it.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And so what is Ergo? As I'm sure most
people know, but in case you don't, it's a

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
truly fair blockchain launched in 2019. No
pre-mine, no ICO, no VC funding. Built by

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
experts, so former Chainlink and Cardano
developers. We have the max supply around

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
97.7 million. Strictly capped. Mission is
decentralized finance accessible to

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
everyone. Philosophy is fair launch,
community driven, and proof of work

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
secured.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So Ergo is a blockchain done right, by
the people for the people.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And so what is mining? The basics: Mining
is securing the blockchain network. You

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
provide computational power, hash rate,
and the network rewards you with ERG

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
tokens. Think of it as getting paid to run
security for a digital bank. Your GPU

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
solves complex mathematical puzzles. The
more puzzles you solve, the more you earn.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Without miners, the blockchain can't
function.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So we've got to secure the transactions,
validate the transactions, secure the

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
network. And so you're not just earning
rewards, you're supporting a revolutionary

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
financial system that is Ergo.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And so what makes this so special? So
it's ASIC resistant, memory hard, proof of

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
work. It's very GPU friendly. It's very
cool. And so a lot of those factors, for

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
me at least, as to why mine Ergo make it a
lot easier on the cards. I know ASIC

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
companies aren't necessarily going to come
into Ergo and sort of rug us.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So no ASICs, like we say, right? Maybe
potentially true decentralization because

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
essentially anybody can go off and buy a
GPU. Anybody that generally has probably a

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
desktop computer potentially with a GPU,
maybe a gaming computer.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So it's more accessible than potentially
mining Bitcoin.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And so a critical factor here is the
emission schedule. I believe when I first

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
started mining, it was probably about, I
think, 75 or 60 ERG was the emission per

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
block all the way down to 12, I believe.
The block time is still static, two

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
minutes. Going to be changing here soon, I
believe. And then our reduction schedule

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
is going to be next.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So every three months it reduces by
three. So nine to six to three should be

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
interesting as things sort of move in that
direction.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So decreasing supply is going to enable
scarcity. And so as miners start to mine

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
more and more of this asset, there'll be
less and less from a daily perspective

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
being emitted into the ecosystem.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Understanding mining costs: you have your
initial investment, but then you have

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
operating costs. Your initial investment
is going to be your GPUs, your

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
motherboards, your CPUs, your power
supply, the frame, everything that you

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
need for the complete compute unit. Then
your operating costs are going to be

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
something to the effect of your
electricity, which is going to be your

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
biggest operating cost. Your internet
connection, cooling - I think ventilation

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
is definitely underexplored here, at least
from my experience when I first started

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
mining. Maintenance and then of course
pool fees, which generally is around 1%

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
depending upon which mining pools you go
to.

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So yeah, as we say here, electricity is
the key determining factor for

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
profitability. A secondary, I suppose,
might be price itself, right? Because if

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the price is like, for ERG at like $100,
that's going to be a little bit different.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But of course, the difficulty kind of
changes.

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So what you need to know about mining:
your hash rate - so how fast your GPU

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
mines, that's going to be relative to how
much ERG you actually earn. Your

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
electricity rate, the network difficulty -
so how hard it is to find these specific

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
blocks. GPU power draw - so how much
electricity you're actually going to be

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
physically using.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And there's differences whether you
measure it from the actual device or is it

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
from the software? Obviously, you want to
measure it from the device, so that's the

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
most sound measurement. Then, of course,
current ERG price and then the block

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
reward. And again, the block reward is
going to change every three months or so.

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And so here is calculating cost to mine
one ERG. And so why do you want to even

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
calculate the cost to mine one ERG? So the
idea here is, say it costs $1.50 to mine

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
ERG, and the current cost is, I think,
like 70 cents or even 60 cents, you are at

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
a loss. Cost to mine ERG is say a dollar,
but ERG is $2. Well, then now you're

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
making 100% more.

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And so this is what this formula is going
to be calculating. And I think as miners,

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
we need to sort of look at it as like a
business perspective and potentially even

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
at a minimum pay off your electricity
costs. But I think additionally, miners

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
are also looking at a speculative bet. So,
hey, maybe one day ERG is going to go up

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
to this mythical price. And if that's the
case, then sell everything and go down and

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
move to the islands or something, right?
Whatever other people's dreams are.

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And so here it is. So it's your hash rate
divided by the network hash, multiplied by

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
the block reward and then the blocks per
day. So that's how much actual ERG you're

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
going to be getting. And then your daily
electrical cost. And then once we have

84
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
those two specific numbers, right? So your
daily electrical costs and then the daily

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
ERGs mined.

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And so, for example, we have here 150
mega hash consuming 150 watts. I think in

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
this example, we're just using kind of
nice numbers. I think 150 watts at 150

88
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
mega hash is quite high. So with the - and
I haven't validated these numbers, so -

89
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
but in any case, network hash rate 50 tera
hash, the electricity is 12 cents per

90
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
kilowatt hour, block reward is 12. And so
your daily ERG is about a quarter of an

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
ERG. Your daily cost is going to be 43
cents. So then your cost per ERG is going

92
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
to be $1.67. So you're instantly paying
more for your ERG.

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That is that calculation. But again, this
could be more of the speculative play. And

94
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:15,000
so, hey, maybe in 10 years ERG is going to
be, $100, $1000. And I'm just going to sit

95
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:29,000
on this kind of like the idea of Bitcoin
and miners back then.

96
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah, you're good to go. Pay a little
premium.

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah, exactly. And that's the key
takeaway, right? And so then if your ERG

98
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
price is greater than your cost to mine,
like we were just saying, it's profitable.

99
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Otherwise, you're at a loss. And then
breakeven is also nice.

100
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So yeah, variables change. So the price
is going to fluctuate. That's why a lot of

101
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
miners, like Son of a Tech, he's always
saying to pay off your electricity first,

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
because that first and foremost, it's a
business. And then if there's any extra,

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
then just hold on to that. But everybody's
game plan, I would say, is sort of

104
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
different.

105
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You can certainly gamble by mining. You
could say, forget it. I'm just going to

106
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
pay the electricity bill because I can pay
that electricity bill and just gather as

107
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
much as I want and just kind of see what
happens.

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So yeah, other variables, right? The
network difficulty increases, block

109
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
rewards. And then, of course, the
electricity rate. They may come knock on

110
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
your door and say, hey, you're using way
too much electricity. You're going to

111
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
start paying more prices, which I've heard
is a thing.

112
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So yeah, so we have long term
considerations. Beyond daily profit, we

113
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
have hardware depreciation over time.
These things are running 24/7. They're

114
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
going to be collecting dust, inherent
entropy within the system. ERG

115
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
appreciation potential hopefully. Resale
value of the mining GPUs - that certainly

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
has been the case.

117
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I have seen that maybe less and less in
the future. Like for example, I bought

118
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
these AMD cards and they were about $750
in 2021 and now they're like $100. And so

119
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
maybe the resale value of mining GPUs,
that could be the case, but currently I

120
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
don't believe it's the case.

121
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Tax implications, of course, in the
United States. So yeah, hodl strategy -

122
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
really just mine at the low prices. Forget
your electricity costs, just pay that. And

123
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
then you have potential 10x returns,
hopefully, we'll see. And then mining is

124
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
in a sense, right, dollar cost averaging
into ERG.

125
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And so, but I think there's certain
byproducts potentially as a result of

126
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
that. So if you live in a colder climate,
you could recapture a lot of this energy

127
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
that is the heat. You could then put that
back into your house. I know a lot of

128
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
people do that. I used to do that when I
lived in Colorado, kept my garage very

129
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
nice and toasty when it was close to zero
degrees or 20 degrees.

130
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And that's just kind of moving into here.
Emission reduction impacts, so right now

131
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
we have 12 ERGs as the block reward, so
8,640 ERGs a day. Then we move into nine

132
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
ERGs, so 6,400 ERGs a day, six ERGs,
4,300, and then three ERGs forever is

133
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
going to be 2,160 ERGs.

134
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And so there will most likely be some
sort of squeeze in the amounts of just

135
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:01,000
scarcity, right? So early miners, we're
saying here, have a massive advantage,

136
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,000
especially when we were mining at really
high rates like 70 ERGs or 65 ERGs for the

137
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,000
block reward.

138
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And so talking about the algorithm, it's
a cool algorithm. So it's very good on

139
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
your specific hardware, which is great for
longevity, because again, talking about

140
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
buying equipment, you potentially want to
just buy this equipment and never have to

141
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
buy equipment again, but most likely
you're going to be buying secondary used

142
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
GPUs that have been running for a very
long time anyhow.

143
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And so you want to run it on something
that's going to be running 24/7, running

144
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
that's not really stress testing these
GPUs who have already been most likely

145
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
abused.

146
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Power efficiency, I think, again, is very
critical. I used to mine, and I used to

147
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
say, oh, I just want the highest hash
power. But in reality, especially with

148
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
economies of scale, you can start to get
at maybe one or two GPUs, no big deal. But

149
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
you get 5, 10, 15, 30 GPUs. This economy
of scale with the specific rigs and all

150
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
that electricity cost, it doesn't really
make too much sense.

151
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And so running cooler means your GPUs
last maybe two to three years longer, 10

152
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
to 20% less power. You might have some
less rewards within Ergo, but I think,

153
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
again, it's like we want to be able to -
mining is like a game that you want to -

154
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
it's not like to win, you want to just
like play the game. And so like, that's

155
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
like the goal here, not necessarily
winners or losers - just want to keep

156
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
staying in business.

157
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And so right, so that talks about
longevity - thermal stress, fan longevity.

158
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So if there's any inherent noise that you
don't necessarily notice, that's inherent

159
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
entropy within the system. And so maybe
something's off kilter. And so maybe every

160
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
six months it's good to have a plan and
just take off the rigs apart, clean them

161
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
all off, put some isopropyl alcohol, get
all the dust out of that, especially for

162
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
the fans, right?

163
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Because if you have more mass, that is
the dust spinning, they're going to have

164
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
to work harder, those motors are going to
have to work harder, and that's just going

165
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
to put more inherent stress on the system.
Not good for longevity.

166
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So the, we have memory intensive mining.
So how Autolykos works is a memory hard

167
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
computation, GPU core sits relatively
idle, but we focus on VRAM - 6 gigabyte

168
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
minimum. 8 gigabyte plus optimal. Of
course, different tuning. So underclock

169
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
the GPU, overclock the memory, reduce
voltage. Again, highly recommend.

170
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Efficiency is key here.

171
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And so yeah, you want to find that
optimization sweet spot. So you can get 80

172
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
to 90% of that max hash rate. So you can
get 60 to 70% power. And that even kind of

173
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
talks about too, again, the longevity of
things.

174
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So if you've got a really nice electric
rate and you're using less power, you can

175
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:41,000
actually put more cards on top of the
entire electrical network that you have.

176
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Because then in theory, instead of using
the total capacity, you can maybe fit one

177
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:01,000
or two extra cards on there to make up for
the lowered hash rate because of the

178
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:11,000
clocks.

179
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Totally. Yeah, Ken was just talking about
the efficiency of the cards compared to

180
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:31,000
something like Kapow and you really just
want to take care of them. But you do have

181
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:41,000
a good point to where it's like, you want
to maximize for this three month period,

182
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:51,000
because in the next three months, you're
going to be getting arguably less. So then

183
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:01,000
you could even think about it as of like
right now hey I'm just going to mine until

184
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:11,000
it hits the three. So then your electrical
rate is essentially fluctuating because

185
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:21,000
now you're actually getting more. Like a
year from now you're going to be getting

186
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:31,000
less and so you can recalculate what the
actual cost would be to mine in the future

187
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and do some weird accounting I'm sure.

188
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah, I don't know, maybe I'd push back
on that, because NVIDIA came out with a

189
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
card solely for mining, and when they
first came out with it - so it's the

190
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
CMP-170HX. It was five grand for that
card. Now you were just showing me today,

191
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
it's like $300. So it's like, and that was
maybe two or three years ago, and that's

192
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
like 400 mega hash for that one card
versus I don't know what the newest cards

193
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
are pumping out, but...

194
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Right. Yeah, it could be.

195
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Right. But what's really nice about
mining is we were kind of talking about it

196
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
a little bit yesterday in one of the side
discussions - virgin coins, a virgin

197
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
wallet, where it's like, it's literally
only ERG coming in here that's mined. So

198
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
there's no sense of - nobody knows where
you're at. You're on your own island

199
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
except the mining pool, but there's no
other transactions tied to that.

200
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I kind of like that idea to where you
build up a nice stack and then nobody can

201
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
tie that to me. I mean, you can use a
mixer, I'm sure, but people can then see

202
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
you use the mixer. It's a very anonymous
way to just dollar cost average into ERG.

203
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You can even move to - they have hosting
farms where they make deals with you and

204
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
you just send your stuff to them and
they're like, oh, we'll give you this

205
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
electrical rate and then in return. But
I'm seeing less and less GPUs do that -

206
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
more and more ASICs for sure.

207
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So, but there's an opportunity, I think,
with solar renewables. Great opportunity.

208
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I think they're relatively cheap. You
could build a nice solar farm, and the

209
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
next thing you know, you have free
printing of ERG because then say all the

210
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
equipment's all paid off. And then if
you've got all the other equipment for the

211
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
solar paid off. And then you're also
routing that heat to heat your house - you

212
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
have this really nice efficient energy
making machine where it's just printing

213
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
ERG, everything else is paid off, and then
the heat is going back into it.

214
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Definitely.

215
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So ASIC resistance - fair mining, and I
think that's a huge aspect because I came

216
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
into certain cryptocurrencies and then
it's like, come to find out, you need to

217
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
buy so much to sort of be able to - in
Cardano, if you want to create a stake

218
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
pool, you really kind of need so much ADA
to create them and mine blocks.

219
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Versus Ergo, you can just say, hey, I'm
going to buy this GPU setup, just point to

220
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
the pool, and you're making money ready to
go. And it could be even used as a burning

221
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
mechanism. You could be like, OK, hey,
this guy needs some ERG, and just turn on

222
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
a rig, and then anonymously fund them, or
something like that.

223
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So fair competition - your GPU competes
on an equal footing. True decentralization

224
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
- so mining power stays distributed
globally, ideally. Dynamic protection - so

225
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
scheduled memory increase, brick any ASIC
attempts. And then community focus - so

226
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
mining rewards stay with individual
miners.

227
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And I think that's a huge one. I think
with the whole ASIC thing we really want

228
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,000
to - I think we've seen the rise and the
fall of various chains that have then

229
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:56,000
said, okay, hey, we'll allow ASICs to come
in. Here we have a hard...

230
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Well, I think it's the algorithm, right?
So it's like, we decided to use this

231
00:22:35,000 --> 00:23:14,000
algorithm and then we'd have to fork it, I
guess, to change the consensus layer that

232
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:53,000
is the algorithm.

233
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yeah. Only time will tell, I suppose.
Hopefully. Yeah. Right. Yeah, absolutely.

234
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Yeah, we can see all these things, but
we'll see what comes out in the wash, I

235
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
suppose.

236
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And so here's some of the hardware
requirements at a minimum. I think we were

237
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
at four gigs for the VRAM, maybe a few
years ago, and then it went up to six. And

238
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
so I had a couple of four gig cards that
obviously wouldn't be able to support this

239
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
anymore. But I think that's an opportunity
for some sort of side chains that's been

240
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
talked about.

241
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So then we have single GPU and multi GPU.
So yeah, your single GPU really is going

242
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
to be like your gaming PC, maybe your
workstation, testing the waters, low

243
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
barrier to entry, ROI potentially 12 to 18
months - we say typically, but who knows

244
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
in this market.

245
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So it's sort of a smaller investment,
depending on what sort of setup you have.

246
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It could be zero because you could have
already potentially have it.

247
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Now your multi-GPU setup. This can be
somebody - it's like, all right, I really

248
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
want to get into this. You have the
electricity cost. That's one thing. It's

249
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
one thing to be like, hey, I'm going to do
all this. I'm going to run five giga hash.

250
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
But then it's like, well, do you have the
electricity to do it? Do you have a 30 amp

251
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
outlet? Can you pay for somebody to
install the 30 amp? Do you need 50 amps?

252
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
What's the safe wattage to run on 30 amps?
Knowing all that stuff.

253
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Even the cords is extremely important
because if you say, hey, I want this

254
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
specific card to run at 300 watts, but the
cord is only good for 250, you're going to

255
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
start a good fire. Or even you're using a
specific 3D printed hanger. So one time I

256
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
3D printed and created my own hangers and
so they'd hang and you have an open

257
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
airframe kind of going through it.

258
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And I was actually just at breakfast with
my wife and I was looking at the camera

259
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
and then as I was looking at it one of the
GPUs fell because after a couple months

260
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and I was using PETG but after a couple
months of just being warmed up, warmed up,

261
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
warmed up, the screws started to sort of
create the hole a little bit bigger and

262
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
bigger and then eventually just would fall
out.

263
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So it's always good to have those sort of
backups and cameras and things because it

264
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:43,000
would suck to put three to ten thousand
dollars down into this, get it all set up,

265
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:51,000
brick a machine, brick a motherboard,
create a fire for all of this sorts of

266
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,000
stuff. So definitely do the single GPU
setup first. Get your feet wet.

267
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Typically, right, yeah. Probably a lot
longer now as of yesterday. These were

268
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
made a few days ago.

269
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
But yeah, I mean, I think that it's a
good point. So Graham had mentioned

270
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
college students, they don't have to pay
for their electricity. So that's a great

271
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
vector or even Airbnbs. I've heard people
get Airbnbs. They see that they have a 30

272
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
amp outlet over their entire setup, get
free electricity. It's a way to do it for

273
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
sure.

274
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And so let's break down the different
mining components. So we have open air,

275
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
which is nice, but it has a lot of
different moving parts. And so I think

276
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
again, kind of going back to that idea of
entropy, if you have a lot of components

277
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
moving within the system, something is
bound to break and you're sort of as

278
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
strong as your weakest link.

279
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So if a PCIe board riser goes out, well
then that's down, but then you've got to

280
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
move everything. And if you've got - I've
had at most 13 cards in there, and you

281
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
have the cords managed very nicely, it's
kind of a pain in the butt to take one

282
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
card out, switch that out.

283
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I prefer the server cases. On Amazon, you
can get them, I think, for like $500. You

284
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:26,000
can put eight cards in there. It comes
with fans. It runs Windows, but you can

285
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:34,000
put in, of course, HiveOS or anything like
that. Highly recommended. And those are

286
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:42,000
stackable, then you can move them
anywhere. Versus the open airframes,

287
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:50,000
definitely not the case.

288
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Right. Yeah, a lot of aftermarket parts
out there right now, probably for cheap,

289
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:15,000
you could just put something. Right. Yeah.

290
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Definitely. The thing I think you'd need
to worry about potentially with mining,

291
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
with that sort of approach, is there's a
lot of move to LLMs being moved to local.

292
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
So I think before the video game group was
getting upset with crypto people because

293
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
they're buying all the GPUs.

294
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
But now I think there's going to be a
move to where now all the crypto guys are

295
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
going to be upset with the AI guys trying
to buy all the GPUs, because I think there

296
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
really will be more of a privacy sort of
thing with LLMs and being like, hey, I

297
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
want to run it on my stuff. I don't want
people knowing what my prompts are and

298
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
things like that.

299
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And I think the tools are generally
moving more towards open source and being

300
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
able to run them sort of locally. And it's
kind of pretty easy to do. We've done it

301
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
with a couple of websites. So just some
sort of food for thought there.

302
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And then I think that even kind of goes
into the idea of like, hey, I could create

303
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
my own LLM setup. And then when my
family's not using it, maybe from 10 PM to

304
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
6 AM, it's just mining Ergo. And it just
has that script that's running. Okay,

305
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
cool. Turning off into offline mode. Now
I'm just going to mine Ergo, turn it back

306
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
on. Now back to the home LLM or whatever
the case.

307
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, home LLM
or whatever LLM you want to call it.

308
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Because I
think as we move further down with LLMs

309
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and I know kind of varying off a little
bit, but like, you could have your camera

310
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
set up with different MCP servers and your
cameras in your house, you maybe want to

311
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
access that LLM to have that. But then now
maybe Google or OpenAI or all these people

312
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
sort of have this data that is your kids
or your family.

313
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And so I think that's where the privacy
is going to maybe potentially come in or

314
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
listening to you. And you just want to be
able to say, Hey, home LLM XYZ, you don't

315
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,000
want it to...

316
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Right. Yeah. Totally. And then it's like,
cool, we have our own little LM setup. It

317
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
does whatever that needs to do. But that
same infrastructure can then be flipped on

318
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
its head when we're not using it to then
run at night and mine Ergo. And then plus

319
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
they're both are going to generate heat.
So I think there's opportunity there to

320
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
create heat, especially for things like
hot yoga - makes no sense to just have a

321
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
heater when you're just constantly going
to be purposely heating something.

322
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So it kind of maybe makes sense to have a
bunch of miners running, even if you

323
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
are... And that's where I think the heat
perspective, you could even flip the

324
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
electricity cost on its head because then
it's like, well, I don't really care.

325
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
We're going to burn this electricity
anyways. But now we get another asset to

326
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
go inside of it and we just get that and
then we just actually get a discount now.

327
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So it's I think a lot of the mining stuff
is really kind of how you look at it. So

328
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
maybe one way it looks like a circle and
then the other way it looks like a square

329
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
- sort of that kind of famous example,
right? Just depends on how you're looking

330
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
at it.

331
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So yeah, understanding the problem. So
each GPU generates 100 to 200 watts of

332
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
heat. Six GPUs could produce 1200 watts of
heat, equivalent to a space heater. And of

333
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
course, we're not even talking about
noise. Noise is also a big problem.

334
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So, I'll just continue here. So, single
rig heat management, we're just talking

335
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
room positioning. So, keeping away from
walls. I think one of the big things with

336
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
mining, people don't really think about is
this concept called heat transfer.

337
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And so really, it's the idea of you have
something generating heat, but we're not

338
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
really thinking about how are we going to
actively move that out of this system. And

339
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
you can think of this room as a closed
system, I suppose. And if you have heat,

340
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
how is it going to generate and eventually
assimilate to the main temperature?

341
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So if you think of it like water, so if
you have water that is room temperature

342
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
but then I pour a little bit of hot water,
eventually it'll take some amount of time

343
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
for this whole water to be the same
temperature. And so that's sort of what

344
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
heat transfer is. And you want to be able
to effectively - especially if you're

345
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
trying to minimize the effect of the heat,
you want to be able to understand - so

346
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
some people will create a rig room and
then they'll create heat isolation and

347
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
then they'll create their exhaust. So
they're kind of creating some insulation

348
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
sort of to help slow or help this
translate the heat in some manner.

349
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So yeah, multiple rigs, definitely a lot
of heat. The challenge scales up. So 10

350
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
GPUs, almost close to 2,000 watts of heat.
It is very hot, very loud. The

351
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
infrastructure needs, I mean, and that's a
serious setup. Even 30 GPUs, it's like

352
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
sometimes they go down, you gotta turn
them back on.

353
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Some months they can run like no big
deal. And then other months it's like,

354
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
dude, every week I gotta, all right, I'm
messing with it. And it's like, hey,

355
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
honey, I'll be right back. I gotta do
something to the rigs. And it'll be like a

356
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
few hours later. And it's like, okay, I'm
finally done. There's a lot of problem

357
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
solving, but for me, I really enjoy that
because it could be a bunch of different

358
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
things.

359
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So yes, we have smart solutions. So yeah,
maybe you got basement mining. So warm air

360
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
rises. So if you're gonna mine, put it
into the lowest point that you can. So

361
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
eventually the heat will actually rise.
Garage with ventilation. So I was mining

362
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
in my garage and so the warmer months I
was actually able to open up both garages.

363
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And so I was able to just draft that heat
super fast, which was really, really nice.

364
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
But the problem with that is inherently
that's a warm area. So bugs are going to

365
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
naturally attract to that spot. So for the
open air sort of cases, I'd have to go in

366
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
there and get some air in a can and just
clean that all up because otherwise that

367
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
organic matter will just collect up,
create dust and eventually could catch

368
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
fire. No good.

369
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It's one thing to get involved with
mining and tell your wife, hey, we're

370
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
going to put 10K into mining, do all that
stuff. It's another to cause a fire. How

371
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
stupid would you look, I guess?

372
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So in hot climates, AC costs are going to
probably kill a lot of profits. But I

373
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
think that is kind of where you need to
put your engineering hat on and sort of

374
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
see how can you - so the idea here is you
got to keep the actual cards cool, not

375
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
necessarily the exhaust.

376
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And so if you can keep that airflow,
what's called laminar, but also over the

377
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
card at that same temperature, whether
it's 80 or 90 degrees Celsius, then that's

378
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:05,000
fine, as long as it doesn't skyrocket up.
But it's definitely a hard problem to do,

379
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:12,000
so maybe mine at night.

380
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Again, it's all about your specific where
you are, where you're located. Maybe

381
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
there's an opportunity to build some sites
on land. Maybe you can dig down in the

382
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
ground. You can actually build up vents
and off gas that heat to some sort of

383
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
greenhouse, things like that.

384
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
There might be an opportunity, especially
out here in Colorado. They grow a lot of

385
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
cannabis from my understanding. They
probably spent a lot of money on heat. So

386
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
what if they had a bunch of Ergo miners
underneath somewhere then off gassing that

387
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
heat and back into the grow house? And so
that would be a huge net positive.

388
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
There was actually - I went on a tour to
one of the dispensaries and they actually

389
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
built the heating mechanism outside of the
property, which makes no sense because now

390
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
it's not even insulated. So now you have
hot air leaving the building, going

391
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
outside to where it's cold, and then going
back in. It's like, no, you should have

392
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
kept that inside. So again, it's all about
efficiency, efficiency for the cards, but

393
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
then also efficiency from an environmental
perspective.

394
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Yeah, right. When we do Chain Cash, we'll
buy a bunch of property and then maybe a

395
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
barter system to be like, okay, who's
going to build the deck? Okay, Mark's

396
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
going to build the mining setup, and so on
and so forth. We need a senior design

397
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
project or something, right?

398
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So, electricity rates definitely matter
the most, right? So, 5 cents to 10 cents.

399
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I got 11 cents. I was okay with that at
the time. And so I was running like five

400
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
giga hash, probably about a year ago. And
I was probably about like three to 400

401
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
bucks a month. I don't remember how much
ERG it was, but which is irrelevant, I

402
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,000
suppose now just because of the
scheduling.

403
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I don't know if that's a typo. So what
are the rates? Many utilities charge...

404
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
oh, I see, right. So different rates. And
so off peak times versus peak hours.

405
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And so again, going back to that sort of
LLM sort of concept, maybe it makes sense

406
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
to run it cheaper at night, the weekends,
when not using it. So it's going to be a

407
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
lot cheaper versus peak hours. And then
additionally, it's like a note about peak

408
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
hours. Peak hours are also correlated most
likely with peak temperature hours.

409
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
So it's like, if I'm in a hot environment
anyways, and then I'm also getting charged

410
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
a lot for electricity, probably doesn't
make a lot of sense to be mining during

411
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
that time anyways. And I think it's okay
to turn your rigs off. Sometimes maybe

412
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
you've had a bad month.

413
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Yeah, so for most mining pools on Ergo,
it's PPLNS, so it's pay per last N shares.

414
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And so N is set by the mining pool, and
ours right now is one half. And so you

415
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
could just think of this as a window. And
so say the last 12 hours are all the

416
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
shares you're going to get calculated for.

417
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So if you just started, you're not going
to have a lot of shares within the last 12

418
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
hours. And so you get penalized for that.
But if you get onboard to the pool after

419
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
those 12 hours, you now have the maximum
full amount of shares that you could

420
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
possibly have.

421
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
But then if you onboard another giga
hash, your shares amount potential then

422
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
increase because now you have more
potential shares to be able to submit

423
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
within that 12-hour window. So if you turn
it off, and it really depends, on

424
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Sigmonauts mining pool, it just depends on
when we find blocks.

425
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
So say for example, you're maxed out on
your 12-hour window. We find a block and

426
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
that was high difficulty. Then we have
high effort. Then we find another block

427
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
within an hour. Then we find another block
- you're going to have a high

428
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
participation because you have the maximum
amount of shares.

429
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Let's say between the second and third
block, you are turning off for the night,

430
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
you're still going to have, say, 90
percent of that window covered because you

431
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
have one hour less, call it, or wherever
the math works out to. But then it goes

432
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
from one hour to six hours. Well, now you
have six hours left of those last shares.

433
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And it really just depends on what the N
is. And so again, ours is one half, but

434
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,000
you could put like four, which could be
weeks. You could do months. So then, but

435
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,000
those are obviously really old shares. And
it's like, we don't really care about

436
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
that. We just care about these more recent
shares. So that's a way to do that.

437
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So then we have solo mining versus pool
mining. So you mine alone. If you get a

438
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
block, you get all the rewards. Very
unpredictable, but really it's only

439
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
unpredictable in the sense of if you have
a small amount - I mean, I'd say it is

440
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
predictable, but it's just, you're not
going to get paid soon, because if you

441
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
have 100 giga hash, it's going to take 30
days, but you could have luck within the

442
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
first hour.

443
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That happened to me. I was like 500 giga
hash and I found two blocks. And I was

444
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
doing a test pool and it was just me on
there. It's just like, oh, well, that

445
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
works out.

446
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And then pool mining, depending on the
fee, you sort of split your hashrate and

447
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
then whenever anybody on the pool finds a
block, then we all split that with respect

448
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
to our participation, which is calculated
by the PPLNS calculation. And then we also

449
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
have the small fee.

450
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
So then we take that ERG reward. We
calculate that fee. The pool keeps the

451
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
fee. And then from there, the PPLNS gets
added to the shares of the database.

452
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I thought I'd fix this, but at one point,
the Sigmonauts mining pool was 1%. It's

453
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
variable. So if you want to vote it to 2,
and it passes, we'll vote it to 2. If you

454
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
want to vote it to 0, we can vote it to 0.
Any miner on our pool, if they want a DAO

455
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
token, we'll give it to you.

456
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
So we're distributing storage rent. We
have bonus tokens, doing a bunch of other

457
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,000
different things. But then we also, of
course, have Herominers, which I believe

458
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
they're also distributing or I know
they're collecting Demarage. I don't know

459
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
how exactly they're distributing it.

460
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Right, okay. Well, the way we do Demarage
distribution is we do it one for one

461
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
participation. So, for that block, we'll
calculate your participation. We'll then

462
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
take that same - we back calculate it, but
we grab that value and then we multiply

463
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
that by whatever the ERG amount we got
from Demarage.

464
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
So, if it's 10 ERG, and your
participation was 10%, then you'll get

465
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
one. And then that's paid, traditionally
that'll be paid every Tuesday, but there's

466
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
some sniping wars sort of happening.

467
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Sorry, say that again?

468
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Yeah, for sure. There was an opportunity
a few months ago where there was this,

469
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
CannonQ can correct me, but I think there
was like 1000 SigmaUSD in Demarage. Wasn't

470
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
it something like that? Or there was like
a thousand in token value. Yeah, yeah,

471
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
yeah. So definitely the incentive is
there. Okay, that's what it was, yeah,

472
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
SigRSV.

473
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Okay, yeah.

474
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Yeah. So let's see, it says Herominers,
it's 2%. I think they do - does anybody

475
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:55,000
know what their payout is? It's not PPLNS,
right? It's like Bitcoin. Isn't it like

476
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Bitcoin pools do it? No? Okay. Fair
enough.

477
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Okay. So yeah, talking about the
Sigmonauts. So we have a DAO run on

478
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Paideia. Everybody has a say in the pool.
We actually have 10,000 ERGs in our

479
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
treasury, which is awesome. Only pool
right now distributing - well, that's not

480
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
true. Sorry, I thought I fixed the storage
rent. But the only pool distributing bonus

481
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
tokens to our miners.

482
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I think at one point we had 60 tokens
that we'd airdrop all at once to, I think

483
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
at most we had 60 people. So that's kind
of cool. We're supporting the ecosystem,

484
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
so fees fund Ergo development and
community projects. All decisions voted on

485
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
by the community are all open, active,
Discord and Telegram.

486
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
We have a bunch of different alerts. So
every time we find a block. Really good

487
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
group of guys, if you're interested in
mining, people are there from all over the

488
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
world. So if you have a question,
generally somebody's on there to answer,

489
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
whether it be about mining. And something
I really like about our mining community

490
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
is I like to think that all the miners are
devs in hiding.

491
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
They just don't know it yet. They have
the technical ability to be able to spin

492
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
up a miner, put up the OS, that takes some
noodling within the terminal and things

493
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
like that. And so we were actually able to
get two of our miners to join the last

494
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
hackathon. So that was pretty neat.

495
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And so storage rent is Ergo's unique
feature. So rent, this is also Demarage.

496
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,000
It's collected from unspent boxes older
than four years. Prevents the blockchain

497
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
bloat and provides additional revenue for
the miners. And so here's just some sample

498
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
current revenue. This is free money for
the most part.

499
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It's just there. It blows my mind that
people don't consolidate their boxes that

500
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
are more than four years old, but maybe
they left the community. And so yeah, on

501
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Sigmonauts mining pool, I wrote a script
that will distribute it all proportionally

502
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
to the Sigmonauts miners based upon our
participation in the database.

503
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
It increases your effective earnings. I
guess we're the only – well, I guess

504
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Grayman said they're distributing it, but
equally. I'd be curious to see how

505
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
exactly.

506
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Right. It would be good on us to put a,
from a transparency perspective, be like,

507
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
hey, this is exactly how we're doing this,
all the FAQs and stuff. I'll have to take

508
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
a note of that.

509
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
But yeah, our fee is 1%. So sorry for all
the spam of the 0.9. Our minimum threshold

510
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
is 0.5. We did create this protocol. I
don't know if it's really a protocol, but

511
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
essentially you could mint an NFT. You
could then inscribe in this NFT your

512
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
minimum or your payout threshold.

513
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And then our system would then pick that
up based off our collection ID. And then

514
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
from there it would automatically change
your payout threshold without having to

515
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
message me or anything like that. So a
little bit more permissionless sort of

516
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
payout thresholds.

517
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Because we have some miners, right? They
might have 50 giga hash and they might be

518
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
making 10, 20, 30 ERGs a day. And if it's
0.5, they're just getting a lot of spam.

519
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
And so from maybe even a tax perspective,
it's nicer to have it in one transaction

520
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
as opposed to five transactions a day.

521
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Plus from the mining pool perspective,
I'd say we don't want to make five

522
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,000
transactions a day if we can just make the
one to save on the TX cost, I suppose.

523
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
So, yeah, if you need to get help, we're
pretty active on Telegram and Discord.

524
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Let's see. Mining with Sigmonauts isn't
just about profit. It's about supporting

525
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
the true decentralization and being part
of the community that believes in Ergo's

526
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
vision. Mining fees fund ecosystem
development, not just corporate profits.

527
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And then, of course, we can vote on those
specific developments. Something like,

528
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
hey, I want to do this and we're going to
spend this, it needs to be voted on by

529
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
everybody.

530
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
So if you want to get started with mining
Ergo, you need a mining wallet. So

531
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Nautilus is what I would recommend. Get a
mining software. Really kind of depends if

532
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
it's NVIDIA or AMD. Mine to the Sigmonauts
mining pool. Check out, I think it's

533
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
ergo-miners.com is our dashboard.

534
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Configure the miner within your wallet,
start mining and monitoring the pool

535
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
dashboard. Again, join our socials.

536
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So here's a couple of different mining
options. Just kind of for the sake of

537
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:06,000
time, kind of get through these. So yeah,
optimize again for efficiency here.

538
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
So yeah, why Ergo? So we've got the
cooler algorithm, better for GPUs,

539
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
declining emissions, so scarcity. So I
think that's been a big thing for a while.

540
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And so now we're actually like in the next
year, we're going to see that play out.

541
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And is that sort of narrative true? I
don't know. We'll find out.

542
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:34,000
ASIC resistance, storage rent income, an
active ecosystem, no pre-mine or ICO.

543
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:43,000
We're gonna be mining until 2045. And
expert developers.

544
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:53,000
So resource and links. Start your mining
journey today. Comments, questions,

545
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:03,000
concerns.

546
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
What is my - yeah, I think it's pretty
cool. I think, Sigmonauts. I think we

547
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
probably have - I'm thinking about it.
We'd have two separate options and I'm

548
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
still sort of fuzzy on the entirety,
aspects, but I think we could probably

549
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
have Sigmonauts mining pool is how we run
it today. But then also...

550
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Yeah, I think we could do that,
irrespective, but we could probably have

551
00:52:47,000 --> 00:53:09,000
to do a DAO vote if we want to do one or
the other or do both. I'm completely open

552
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:31,000
with what the DAO wants to do. So, kind of
open to. So, absolutely.

553
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that'd be a really -
I'm not sure if mining core does that. I

554
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
mean, Geez, do you know? Like is this...

555
00:53:44,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Okay. Sick. Right.

556
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Totally.

557
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Yeah, some guy named Oliver.

558
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Yeah, that'd be a really cool idea. Can
you overstuff the transaction? So if I'm

559
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:51,000
in the pool and you're saying, hey, I want
to make the transaction, could I put as

560
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:59,000
much as I want in there? And then that
would essentially push out...

561
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Right, right, right. Yeah, that'd be a
cool idea because right now for our bonus

562
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,000
tokens, we're doing that once a week
and...

563
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Okay. Yeah, that's definitely a good -
I'll be relying on Geez there to help us

564
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
out.

565
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Sweet. Alright, cool. Any questions
online? I don't think so.

566
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Alright, cool.
