1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Or good afternoon, I guess, in your case,
kushti.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hey, man.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
My pleasure to be here again.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And yeah, it's good to see you here
again.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And it is good that we are starting on
time after so many attempts.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Finally, everything is working smoothly.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
from the first minute.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
All right.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So what's new on your end, my friend?

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What have you been working on?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
A lot of things.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So finalizing 6.0.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah, well, still there is need to check,
review something.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So yeah.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
discovered some issues, well, versioned
issues, so I'm fixing them now.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Then, yeah, back to sub-blocks, so doing
some codes now, and yeah, hopefully this

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
month if no surprises, but they always
happen.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So yeah, hope to publish EAP reworked EAP
proposal based on the forum text which is

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
messy and now needs for polishing along
with some codes.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Currently I have just some stupid stuff
so some blocks being generated.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
by local miner and then processing stops
here and there.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So now I'm filling this with real logic,
maybe of prototype quality, but still.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And then, yeah, we'll polish things.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Then what else?

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So, yeah, so for Dexy, we have

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Spectrum DEX pull request merged and
yeah, checking what to do next.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There is need for more developers, in
particular we need for UI maintainer.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's a good idea probably to introduce UI
fee like done in SigmaUSD interface.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So, yeah, please reach, please join us.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So, yeah, that's the main limiting factor
for now.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Probably then, yeah, also would be happy
to see contributions with sub-blocks.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So, yeah, we'll check developers.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
group today, so if there are guys willing
to contribute, I will make issues with

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
bounty and so on.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Then reviewing Sigma Rust.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
features so just today reviewed and yeah
it seems to be done now support for

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
deterministic signatures which is needed
for keystone integration so yeah it seems

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
pgr456 now unblocked

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So he was blocked with the need for
deterministic signatures since there is no

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
random generation API provided by
hardware.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
on Keystone, unlike, let's say, big
operating systems like Linux, Windows, and

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
so on, right?

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So there is need to work with randomness
differently, in short, and, yeah, so now

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
it's supported by Sigma Rust, so, well,
Keystone integration is going further,

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
then.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Then for ledger integration,

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Unfortunately, my peer wasn't approved by
Ledger, so he is a former Kudelsky

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
security employee, but we were not lucky
in getting a Ledger team to get Kudelsky

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
quality from the former.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
employees.

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So yeah, I mean, currently, well, other
folks are, well, looking, actually talking

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
with approved entities.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So it's about Kudelsky and yeah, another
company, which name I've forgotten.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So Kudelsky is well known to me.

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:22,000
since they did some audits for some parts
of the Sigmanauts before, back in 2019.

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So they did audit for inbuilt wallets,
for cryptography, for proof of work,

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
certain aspects of it.

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So, yeah, what else?

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So, yeah, also,

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
thinking about how to get more developers
on board, so on Saturday I'm giving a talk

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
at some local events.

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I mean, it's mostly a developer's event,
just like maybe 50 or 60 folks attending.

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But yeah, I mean, it's good still, right?

66
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So maybe with just a few developers, we
can do more.

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So I mean, there are a lot of ideas.

68
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So just Bruno only has like, I don't
know.

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
like five or six new different ideas and
then yeah I also well published some

70
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
things on forum recently such as hashrate
coin random coin and so on and yeah there

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
is needs to improve infrastructure

72
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
still write a bit, then in core there is
need for some development, for reviews,

73
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
for documentation and so on.

74
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Then published very recently an article
about, well, it's called Money Ownership

75
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
in the age of programmable money, right?

76
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And based on that now doing a talk for
some events which is about art actually

77
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and it will be it will take place in Italy
on December 21st and I'm recording video

78
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and it will be about property rights in
the age of program money right because

79
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
well

80
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It seems with tokenized real-world assets
and so on, with smart contracts in

81
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
particular, right, so this topic is more
broad, especially if we are talking about

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
such, well, blockchain.

83
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
let's say, friendly to, well, grasping
such ownership issues as Ergo, right?

84
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But even if you are talking about
Ethereum, so I made a tweet recently about

85
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
another cash court decision, and yeah,
it's also about property rights recently,

86
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
right?

87
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So the court actually decided

88
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That Tornado Cash smart contract is not a
property, right, and then it cannot be

89
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
OFAC sanctioned, right, because of that.

90
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So it's just an autonomous piece of
software and then, yeah, it's not quite

91
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
legal to sanction a piece of code.

92
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Which is actually quite interesting
development and I think it also does sound

93
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
similar, but Yeah, well, so I'm doing a
talk for some events about art Digital art

94
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
in particular then.

95
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah, we have

96
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
A lot of interesting possibilities here
talking about property rights and

97
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
programmable property rights sometimes
maybe and so on for tokenized assets,

98
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
tokenized art and so on.

99
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So preparing a talk about that, then also
planning another Asian tour and this time

100
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:45,000
hopefully it will not be Dubai because too
much Dubai probably for me.

101
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So, yeah, thinking about visiting Hong
Kong around consensus conference and,

102
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
yeah, well, maybe some place around.

103
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So, I know we have Sigmanauts in Vietnam,
South Korea, and so on.

104
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So, yeah, well, we'll check with peers
there.

105
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What's the possibility?

106
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But yeah, it would be good to make
something in Hong Kong also.

107
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So we had quite good meet-up there back
in 2019, which is available on YouTube, by

108
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
the way.

109
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's talk from there.

110
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Then, what else?

111
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What else?

112
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Now, what's new in terms of the dev
update this week?

113
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I saw a lot of things from qx().

114
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah, well, it was quite an amazing dev
update.

115
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So we have a new developer which made a
tool, actually quite an interesting tool

116
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
to encrypt and decrypt seed phrase.

117
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
to produce BEP-39 seed phrase and encrypt
it.

118
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
He claims that he is not a developer but
willing to do something on Ergo, so he

119
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
used AI mostly on that, but the seed
quality is checked with some Python

120
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
statistical analysis scripts and so on so
yeah that sounds interesting so well

121
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
please feel free to check the chat and to
check the tool and use it so I don't know

122
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I mean it's getting more and more
interesting because well

123
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm going to check developers which
joined recently or started to develop

124
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
something not so trivial recently, such as
HQx, right, with MewTooling, and then Mark

125
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,000
the Shark, this new guy with AI script.

126
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I made a script and yeah, who else?

127
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
There are two or three other folks.

128
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah, Beene, some guy with a Discord
account, Beene somewhat.

129
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And, yeah, so, my impression, is that,
these days, because, we have a lot of open

130
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
source, tooling available, open source
contracts, UI and so on.

131
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So developers, mostly well combining,

132
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
taking existing functionality, right,
and, well, reworking it into something

133
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
new, right, some modifications for
starters, then deeper modifications, then

134
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
something maybe totally new.

135
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So that was the path of MewFinance, I
believe.

136
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Right, and that's actually

137
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
quite exciting to me so that's the power
of open source right so not just open

138
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
source but free software right so you can
take it you can modify you can run

139
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
modified version freely right and then
yeah the only thing is that yeah well do

140
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
your modification free as well right and
then people will develop

141
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:52,000
on foundations provided by you and then
yeah because of that we may have well

142
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,000
evolutionary development process right
with stable and solid contracts and yeah

143
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
also streamlined and easy development
cycle so

144
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Quite good, but also talking about qx()
and so on.

145
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I think still the Ergo potential is
uncovered by like 1% maybe.

146
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
roll-up schemes and so on.

147
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So I'm thinking about some layer 2
constructions discussing some these days

148
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
even with very old folks.

149
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Some with Cardano even since he has some
experience with Bitcoin layer 2.

150
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The idea is that, yeah, well, it's fine
to, well, building on the existing ground,

151
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
but yeah, well, it's 99% of potential
still uncovered, so there is time to,

152
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
well...

153
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
open new horizons, right, for the
different developments possible to do more

154
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
writings, forum posts and so on.

155
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And Luivatra, for example, Luivatra made
an excellent post recently about how to

156
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
use EAP5, so contract templates, which is
quite powerful to link.

157
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
actually which is allowing for using well
contracts within contracts so to to reason

158
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
about contracts within contracts right in
some not so hard and yeah pretty

159
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
streamlined way so yeah quite powerful
feature and i'm not sure any other

160
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
blockchain has it actually

161
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah, so that was also starting to play
with the mempool and voting, which is

162
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
awesome to see.

163
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah, that's probably all and probably
enough from me.

164
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So what's on your side?

165
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I was pretty excited to see Lithos
development, where I know that qx() is

166
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
starting to finish the NIPoPoWs contracts
and work on DevNets.

167
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So I was trying to create more contracts
for kind of optimistic evaluations of

168
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
NIPoPoWs and working on kind of share
proofs.

169
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The Sigmanauts mining pool this week was
hitting some big boxes in terms of storage

170
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
rent.

171
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That was really nice to see.

172
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I guess just based on like four years in
the past, they're starting to pick up more

173
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
kind of activity in terms of boxes
available that are, kind of stale.

174
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So seeing those extra miner rewards is
pretty awesome.

175
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I also saw that DuckPools is going to go
through their next round of kind of

176
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
raising.

177
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
If you look at how their roadmap is

178
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
laid out.

179
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
They said, okay, well, we're going to go
through periodic fundraising efforts and

180
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
have pretty clear

181
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
roadmap in terms of what they're going to
do for each particular phase.

182
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I always support that.

183
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I always throw my money at it because,
it's one of those things that I guess,

184
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
where your attention goes, you tend to get
more of, right?

185
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Well, you pay for what you want to see.

186
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So that's one of my favorite projects in
Ergo that, they do a lot of really good

187
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
documentation.

188
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
If you go through,

189
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Everything that they do, which, circling
back to, kind of this idea of like a

190
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
natural evolution of, kind of the
development around open source software,

191
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
having that type of, not only complexity,
but like documentation detail is, is

192
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
really foundational.

193
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So, I always have to kind of tip my hat
to, what crass is doing over there and,

194
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
encourage people to look into it, support
it, use it.

195
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Paideia DAO is kicking off and I think
that's going to be really powerful

196
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
software suite long-term.

197
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I think that, yeah, you do need like
direct management and engagement, which is

198
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
sometimes hard when people's mindset is
more like, I don't know, just speculative,

199
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
the main pointing or whatever in the
crypto space, but having like real world

200
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
tools that are useful is, is, fascinating
to me.

201
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What else?

202
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
PGR, it looks like he submitted the whole
request for the, silver Oracle.

203
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So, as Dexy moves towards, main net,

204
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I've got to rethink with Bruno and the
team and see what options are available in

205
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
terms of kind of the natural evolution of
protocols where I guess we have enough

206
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
time now watching Gluon.

207
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
that we could potentially say, okay,
well, what have we learned based on

208
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,000
experience and what are the observations
and potentially improve or alter the

209
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
existing Gluon Gold a little bit, which I
think is a pretty neat step forward.

210
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What else?

211
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,000
We submitted the Hummingbot requests to
the Hummingbot Foundation.

212
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Which is going to lead to really kind of
a unique framework where, with Rosen

213
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Bridge, we kind of unified trading
environments across, central exchanges.

214
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But, one of the neat things about,
hummingbot for, trading on top of Rosen

215
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Bridge or managing liquidity is, you now
have access to multiple,

216
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
environments to bot trade on KYC free.

217
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So that's always a nice assumption for
users.

218
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't know exactly how long that's
going to take for them to go through like

219
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
a review process, but that's kind of the
next order of operations in that kind of

220
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
development path.

221
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And it's going to be interesting to see
what

222
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
evolves there because Ergo is kind of a
nice environment due to low fees, right?

223
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So you always have like this, friction in
terms of the market costs of trading.

224
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
if you're talking like an AMM, you can
look at the pool fee, which is always some

225
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
balance between,

226
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,000
what liquidity providers, are
incentivized by as well as what, the

227
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
people buying and selling are willing to,
inherit, I guess in terms of costs.

228
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And then you also have this execution,
cost, which, in some systems, if you look

229
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
at like EVM with gas, when, Bitcoin goes
through down or up,

230
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
there's always a race, and DeFi protocols
and gas goes through the roof.

231
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And it'll be interesting to see how, I
don't know, kind of the efficiency of,

232
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
order execution, and Ergo makes it an
attractive, market for more active trading

233
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
because lower that friction a little bit
in terms of costs.

234
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And then it's just a matter of liquidity
and opportunity, I guess.

235
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's see with Rosen Bridge, yeah,
working on a Dogecoin integration.

236
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
We finally, pushed a more dynamic mobile
build, which is nice to see.

237
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm not always the biggest mobile user to
be honest, just cause yeah, phone is

238
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
small.

239
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's easy to lose that kind of thing.

240
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
But, having a dynamic UI is pretty nice
to see.

241
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And I hope people out there appreciate
that.

242
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Also working with, Binance Smart Chain,
going through rounds of testing in terms

243
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
of integration, we're working on creating
a new watcher build that hopefully is a

244
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
little bit more, performant efficient, a
lot of upgrades in the background and up

245
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and down the stack, and Rosen Bridge, I
hope that,

246
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Yeah.

247
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
My goal is, we see, we see that live as
we roll through the end of the year, but

248
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
we always need to test and check and then
repeat.

249
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So we're kind of in that phase.

250
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah, that's pretty much it for me.

251
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You want to get into the questions?

252
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
My bad, was muted.

253
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So, yeah, let's jump on the questions.

254
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:08,000
There is some topic to discuss, but qx()
is not here.

255
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
After a year spending a week with
students and getting probably totally

256
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
exhausted.

257
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I don't understand him.

258
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
All right, so...

259
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah, well, we need to decide when to
make spaces and zoom calls.

260
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
But yeah, let's do that our telegram.

261
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
group which is bridged with Discord.

262
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I mean the main Telegram group which is
bridged with a general channel in Discord

263
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and yeah we can discuss such things after
the AMA.

264
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So yeah let's jump on the questions.

265
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
All right so let's start maybe with Mr.
Whitecat.

266
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Hello guys where is your PPJs?

267
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah, the most serious question probably.

268
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I just woke up.

269
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's one of those things, I keep the
video above the chest.

270
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah, the same reason.

271
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So yeah, you have to guess what PPJs are.

272
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Let's see.

273
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'll go.

274
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I think FC has a good question.

275
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Tokenization is easy in theory, right?

276
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Chop something up into small bits via a
good smart contract.

277
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
What are the standards for controlling
physical assets?

278
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Seems right with fraud and mismanagement.

279
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yeah, there's a lot of
hyperfinancialization schemes around

280
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
tokenization that may or may not make
sense, right?

281
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'll drop some of my perspective, okay?

282
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
So like in Colorado, we have this area in
the middle of the state called the San

283
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Luis Valley, right?

284
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It's a kind of beautiful area, but it is
like this high desert, okay?

285
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And so the infrastructure and the utility
of land there is not so great actually.

286
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It's kind of interesting because there's
like some geographical like qualities in

287
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
terms of like deep water and stuff but
it's pretty popular for people to say like

288
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
okay somebody bought this huge track of
land and then they split it up into these

289
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
tiny little chunks

290
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And they fractionalize it and then they
try to say okay.

291
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Well, now we're going to sell these
little fractions of land that are absent

292
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
infrastructure and give them to people as
some sort of like speculative asset or I

293
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
don't know I guess sometimes people will
go up there in camp or whatever So I guess

294
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
there's some utility there but it kind of

295
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:12,000
can create a more of a financial scheme
than like a utility driven development.

296
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
OK. And it's really interesting if you if
you start to say, OK, well, let's take

297
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
like, I don't know, my car and you
fractionalize ownership of it across

298
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
people who gets to use it.

299
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Is it something that's like being

300
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
driven for a utilitarian commercial
purpose that has profit distribution.

301
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Who is in charge is always an interesting
question in there.

302
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Who gets to use whatever the utility is.

303
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
You take a house and chop it into
millimeter by millimeter squares and say,

304
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
okay, well,

305
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I'm going to sell these shares of the
house.

306
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And what does that represent in reality?

307
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Right.

308
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
does it just represent like some
fractional ownership of like an asset?

309
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And it's interesting because maybe that,

310
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
is useful if there's like revenue and
profit distribution, but it also creates

311
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
some weird questions like who controls the
title.

312
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Right.

313
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Because when you're talking about
physical assets, you usually have some

314
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
regulatory layers that you have to deal
with.

315
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And when you have centralized
counterparties, you generally need some

316
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
legal entity or a mechanism to deal with
those like friction points.

317
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Right.

318
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And then it's abstracted a little
further.

319
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Let's say that you have a house that has
been put in millimeter by millimeter

320
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
squares and sold.

321
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
How do you come to consensus to actually
sell the house?

322
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Or are you permanently stuck in this
weird notion of fractionalized ownership

323
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
that has no consensus to actually move the
asset?

324
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And then, when that happens where it's
like you're stuck, there's usually some

325
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,000
party or entity that's taking fees from
moving around these little fractions.

326
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And, it kind of creates, I don't know,
just weird schemes.

327
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Right.

328
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Do I think that having like.

329
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
physical real world assets on chain is
valuable.

330
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Yeah, I think it can be super valuable in
terms of how money is raised and perhaps

331
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
how profits are distributed.

332
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
But you have to always remember those
layers of like regulatory footprint in

333
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
some jurisdiction and physical reality.

334
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And that adds extreme complexity off
chain that makes like clean logic

335
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
hard.

336
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I think it makes a lot more sense when
you have like, say gold, it's a bearer

337
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
asset, right?

338
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It doesn't have a footprint in a
jurisdiction and a lot of those layers,

339
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
are less influential versus if you have a
house or I don't know, mineral rights or a

340
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
car or, something that is more grounded in
a single jurisdictions and laws, like the

341
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
level of complexity goes through the roof
completely.

342
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So it's tokenization easy in theory.

343
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yeah.

344
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But then when you look at like off chain
reality is messy and you kind of are

345
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
forced more or less to comply within
existing jurisdictions.

346
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And that is not always easy to do in a
distributed or decentralized or trustless

347
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
way.

348
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I guess.

349
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
what do you think?

350
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
kushti?

351
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:02,000
yeah so mostly but will continue actually
so yeah well it's quite complex when

352
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:11,000
you're talking nice something like a house
or a picture right so I mean if you have

353
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:20,000
some picture at some art gallery and you
will digitize

354
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Well, so sell digital piece of it, right?

355
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So like 1,000 pieces, then what does it
mean to own one piece out of 1,000, right?

356
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
So what are your property rights here?

357
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But it's even more complex if you think
programmability, right?

358
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
If you're adding more complex
cryptography and if you're adding scripts,

359
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So, for example, we have till 1,000
pieces, but one piece is owned by you,

360
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:04,000
another by me, third piece is owned by...

361
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:12,000
well, two out, two signature of yours and
mine and then fourth well, possessed by a

362
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,000
ring signature, so one key out of those
two keys here, so oh my and then let's say

363
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:28,000
500

364
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
tokens are possessed by some contract,
blocking one token a month and maybe

365
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
sending it to the last block miner.

366
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:50,000
At the moment, if this emission contract
has five

367
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:00,000
100 tokens, let's take maybe a more clear
example, 600, right?

368
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Then yeah, at this point, well, majority
of tokens

369
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
if that makes sense, talk about majority
of tokens representing a picture.

370
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So possessed by some contracts, but it's
hard to associate those tokens with some

371
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
ease, without this in the real deal,
right?

372
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
So, I mean, this session will be made,
right?

373
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,000
gradually, token by token, by the
emission process.

374
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So yeah, that is at this point when it's
still locked in the contract.

375
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Well, who owns this picture, right?

376
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It's quite complicated.

377
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Yeah, it seems commodities is the lowest
hanging fruit, so I'm talking with Dan

378
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,000
about his Lithos project, right?

379
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And then, well, in commodities,

380
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:20,000
settings so it makes sense to combine
physical and digital

381
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
like it's right.

382
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So tokens representing physical lithium,
for example, with well, algorithmic

383
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
lithium stable coin, for example, which
would be used to secure which is not

384
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
produced yet.

385
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Right.

386
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So if you're buying lithium, then you can
get stable coin immediately.

387
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Right.

388
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Then, yeah, well, you're sick.

389
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,000
by that stable coin, but when physical
lithium is produced, you can exchange

390
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
algorithmic lithium to physical lithium.

391
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
to digital tokens representing physical
lithium for starters and then to physical

392
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
lithium, right, which you can hold in your
hands if you want to hold lithium in your

393
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
hands.

394
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It could be toxic, I'm not sure.

395
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Well, in regards with this, it's not an
issue, right?

396
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Currently we have an issue with solid
stable coins such as SigmaUSD, Gluon also

397
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
probably, right?

398
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Because of, well, over-collateralization
means you cannot mint a lot of tokens,

399
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:55,000
right, because you need a lot of capital,
right, reserves and so on.

400
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
But when you use algorithmic stablecoins
as a buffer, right, for physical assets,

401
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,000
then it makes sense that you are using

402
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
algorithmic stable coins to secure risks,
right?

403
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,000
You may have, for example, lithium may
not be produced, right?

404
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
There is a chance of that.

405
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Or you can buy a brick of gold in

406
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
some vault in Dubai, for example, when
you're outside, but then you have a chance

407
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
of another COVID pandemic, right?

408
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And then no flights, so you cannot reach
the vault.

409
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And in this case, you can have, well,
your stablecoin-based insurance,

410
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
basically.

411
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I made a forum post on that.

412
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:05,000
many months ago on well contracts which
is securing physical assets with digital

413
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:17,000
algorithmic twins so physical gold for
example with algorithmic gold

414
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah, there's a lot of financial products
that exist based on like the time friction

415
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
of delivery, right?

416
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So it's like, you have, I guess, a lot of
paper financial products that first

417
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
started with that friction where it's
like, okay,

418
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
You own something that is in transit to
you or to somewhere else.

419
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And so it represents a claim rather than
like a possession.

420
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Like it's not really a bearer asset
because you don't have it.

421
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Someone else has it, but you have that
friction in terms of settlement and

422
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
physical reality.

423
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Right?

424
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So it's like you have a producer that
fills a ship with oil.

425
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And as that oil is moving across the
ocean contracts are constantly being

426
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
switching hands, every turn of the
propeller until it gets to the final

427
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
destination.

428
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And then usually there's some notion of
like settlements.

429
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
and possession of the commodity once it's
physically arrived.

430
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And that friction is never going to go
away in physical reality, right?

431
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
We're talking about things that do not
settle instantly because they have to move

432
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
in the real world.

433
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And so having some

434
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I guess abstraction of ownership that I
guess in some sense, there's like a layer

435
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
two where it's like a notion of like pre
confirmation and settlement that will

436
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
later happen once reality catches up.

437
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
That's constantly happening with
commodities.

438
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And I think that is one of the more
interesting use cases of those type of

439
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
stable coins.

440
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Right.

441
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
So yeah, well, a lot of interesting
possibilities here, right?

442
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And a lot of complexities, especially if
we are talking about property rights.

443
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:29,000
In this age, we are already living in the
age of programmable assets, right?

444
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Programmable ownership.

445
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Probably good to answer this question
from Wombo.

446
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Arm, can you speak a bit about your
experience over the week with catalyst

447
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
drama, what you heard and your thoughts on
it?

448
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I don't know.

449
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I don't, I don't really see it as drama.

450
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
So, the catalyst is built with, certain
parameters.

451
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Okay.

452
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And, and whenever you're going to deal
with things on chain, it's a good idea to

453
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
get some like notion of what the
parameters are and how things operate.

454
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So like from my framework, I don't know.

455
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It's essentially like a DeFi protocol,
right?

456
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And so as a DeFi protocol, I guess if you
look at how it functions, it is something

457
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
that has an open attack vector for whales.

458
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It always has, right?

459
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
So, we can look back in the Ergo
experience of like, SigmaUSD, for a while

460
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,000
had, had a, a certain whale that was
moving things around just based on the

461
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,000
weight of value that that whale could push
around, right?

462
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
That's always been a open vector for
catalyst drama.

463
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And so, I've always kind of watched
catalysts and say, okay, this is

464
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
interesting.

465
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Like if I were to go talk to Binance or a
bit, or, party that, has a dominant amount

466
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:19,000
of power in, Let's say ADA, they have the
ability to influence outcomes.

467
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
That's how the system is designed.

468
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
So then it's like, okay, there's some
logical path where unless that changes,

469
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
the most logical outcome is that a large
party can vote for themselves.

470
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Right.

471
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And, that is kind of a shitty form of
governance, maybe, but I don't know.

472
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I didn't create the parameters.

473
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It's not my game, but I went to the table
with that knowledge.

474
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Right.

475
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And so you had an entity that's actually
not that large of an entity and it was the

476
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Cardano foundation, which I'm going to say
probably has more.

477
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I don't know alignment of intent than
other potential whales right if we if we

478
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
look at the SigmaUSD and like how the bear
whale has his own incentive right and

479
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
that's profit I think probably the cardano
foundation has less of a profit incentive

480
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
maybe they're making a statement or trying
to get something I don't know exactly what

481
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
their intent was and to be honest I don't
need to care because

482
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
That's how the game is, right?

483
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So if something happens in an open.

484
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
system within the parameters of how
protocol functions, that's called fair

485
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
game.

486
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
So I'm not going to sit around and cry
about it.

487
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And, I know some people will talk about
philosophy and social theory and what is

488
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
good and what is, bad and what is right
and what is wrong.

489
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And those are terrible security
incentives for DeFi.

490
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And essentially that's how this system
operates.

491
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So no crying.

492
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
understand your assumptions in the system
and try to do your best to navigate within

493
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
that.

494
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And, like for Rosen Bridge, we've tried
to create partnerships with, when MensSwap

495
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
supported us in the past, Liquid has
supported us and they have, pretty large

496
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
power in terms of allocating votes.

497
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
That's just the game, right?

498
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So it is what it is.

499
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Things happen.

500
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
No crying.

501
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
You just, adapt, figure it out, move
forward.

502
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I think that sometimes when you're
looking like DeFi, you just need to be

503
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
cold and look at the parameters of a
system.

504
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
This is how it functions and, operate
from that perspective rather than like an

505
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
emotional level.

506
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Because, yeah, crying is not the type of
liquidity we need, folks.

507
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,000
why don't we go to the next question?

508
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
what did you pick?

509
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Actually a lot of questions.

510
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
some comments.

511
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Nice coffee cup, Joe.

512
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
anything to share about hack
participants, winners.

513
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
You want to take this?

514
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I was not a judge this time.

515
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I've been a little bit busy off-chain.

516
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I do know that it looks like Satergo came
in first place.

517
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I think Bruno got second.

518
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The Shark and the Sigmanauts came in
third.

519
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I haven't really dived into the projects
to be honest.

520
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
what are those things where you get busy
and then just external like bandwidth yes

521
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
so yeah the first place is not just
satergo but satergo offline world so yes

522
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,000
some solution for well increased security

523
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Especially when we are talking about
sensitive amounts, right?

524
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
You shouldn't use mobile for sure, right?

525
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I mean, that's quite a terrible choice
talking about security.

526
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
So, I mean, mobile wallet is just for
small amounts to play with, yeah, to have

527
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
some fun, maybe to buy a pizza with ERGs
and so on, but yeah, not for serious

528
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
holding.

529
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:24,000
One of the options for serious holding
would be better after certain reviews.

530
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I would be happy to find time to take a
look at Satergo Offline World.

531
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Then, yeah, well, the second place is
Bruno's, yeah, benefactory platform.

532
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And, yeah, I'm in the middle of watching
the video, actually, so, yeah, well, I'm

533
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
posting them to ergochats.

534
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
When I'm starting watching, I've posted
Satergo and Brunos and I'm in the middle

535
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
of listening to it in the background.

536
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Then the third place is Sigmanauts mining
pool somewhat project-wide.

537
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And then there are other interesting
projects such as community, liquidity.

538
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:26,000
bootstrapping initiative so how well
people who don't know about Ethereum and

539
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:34,000
so on can participate in liquidity
provision on Ethereum so provide liquidity

540
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:42,000
for

541
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Ethereum to ERG and USDT to ERG pools on
Uniswap.

542
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
So very interesting project, I think.

543
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Yeah, well, we need to check other
projects, so I didn't participate this

544
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
time because of traveling.

545
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Yeah, well, I didn't have time to take a
close look to all the submissions, to be

546
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
honest.

547
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So, yeah, well, maybe next time we can
provide more extensive reviews.

548
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:36,000
A lot of things happening.

549
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Yeah, then any question?

550
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
No, let me.

551
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
You want to prioritize a lot of
questions.

552
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
That's good.

553
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
A lot of good questions.

554
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Let's take this one from Luke Graysmith.

555
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Can government be separated from money?

556
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Can money be separated from government?

557
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,000
For most of human history, the peg, the
least that fiat has been around the peg.

558
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
that kind of was the underlying base
layer of money was not necessarily

559
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
controlled by government then that would
be like gold and silver now to some degree

560
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
it's like okay was that physical asset
like controlled and through force yeah so

561
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
i guess i guess

562
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Like on some level, even though like gold
and silver being like the underlying peg

563
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
for most fiat, still was connected to this
idea of like, I don't know, keep what you

564
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
kill.

565
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And usually, governments and, groups have
always kind of been fighting for ownership

566
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
rights of various resources on this
planet.

567
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
So it's hard to say like, full
separation.

568
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,000
because government is just some like
abstraction of collective human power and

569
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:59,000
it's kind of hard to have like money which
is a human phenomenon separate from

570
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
like humanity is a collective.

571
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
But one interesting thing about something
like, proof of work assets or gold is it's

572
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
like it is globally distributed.

573
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It just takes, work and energy to, in
essence, refine or extract these assets.

574
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And there's a separation from the, let's
say,

575
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,000
And there's like hard, the ability to
hard code amounts in terms of money, which

576
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I guess maybe like on some level, the
universe did that in terms of like

577
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
precious metals that are available in our
little biosphere or in like the case of

578
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Bitcoin or Ergo, they launched from
Genesis with some finite amount.

579
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So like, is it, can it be separated?

580
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I think that the,

581
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
It's not exactly a clear-cut question
because, government is just like an

582
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
abstraction of collective human
consciousness that, creates some consensus

583
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
or order and, usually has some notion of
like projecting power.

584
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
So not fully, but you can certainly
restrict some of the parameters around

585
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
like money and how that operates.

586
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And I think that as

587
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Like you get away from centralization,
you generally get better assumptions.

588
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
What's your thought, kushti?

589
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Yeah, so historically also, well, many
countries now also called free banking

590
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:44,000
when banks issued money without special
regulations.

591
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So that was in the U.S.

592
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Mostly from 1830s to 1864.

593
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Then later it took place in Canada, Hong
Kong.

594
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Yeah, I'm not sure about regulations, but
yeah, currency there is well issued by

595
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
private banks.

596
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
But yeah, I guess there are regulations
now, right?

597
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:27,000
So well, currently, I'm not sure any free
banking systems remain.

598
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
And so there are talks about getting back
to free banking, right?

599
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And I think with blockchain it actually
makes sense because of transparency,

600
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
right?

601
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So the usual issue was

602
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,000
well fractional reserve rights and well
improper reporting of reserves by private

603
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,000
banks then yeah in all the cases basically
governments use that to intervene right so

604
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,000
to take control but then they did
basically the same so well improper

605
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,000
reporting of reserves and so on

606
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Well, playing with fractional reserve, so
it was back in 19th century even, right,

607
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:25,000
so a long time before abandoning gold
standard.

608
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
So back in 19th century there was no
government fully backing paper money

609
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
despite the claims.

610
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Already right, but still some governments
used the same issues on the private bank

611
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:48,000
side to take control from private banks.

612
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
rather than to do the same, basically.

613
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,000
So yeah, now with blockchains, right,
with transparency.

614
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
possible transparency of reserves and
operations.

615
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Yeah, it's possible, right, to get back
to free banking and actually I saw

616
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,000
ChainCash is some attempts, right, to
model the revival of free banking on top

617
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
of blockchain assets.

618
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
So the second presentation

619
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:33,000
of ChainCash is about that.

620
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Actually, so the first one was more
technical, right?

621
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And yeah, it was ErgoHack report.

622
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
But yeah, the second presentation is for
a general audience familiar with free

623
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
banking ideas.

624
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
But the idea is simple as that.

625
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:55,000
So it's when private banks can issue

626
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,000
money rights under the same units of
accounts.

627
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Well, hey, if you're talking about the
US, for example, back in 19th century, so

628
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
it was dollar right, but issued by
different banks.

629
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:21,000
And well, on blockchain, now everyone can
be the bank rights.

630
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Yeah, well and also Everyone well in case
of ChainCash is free to use full coverage

631
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:39,000
or fractional reserve And then yeah, it's
it's up to well agents accepting Not see

632
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:48,000
issued in this free banking kind of system
and

633
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Yeah, going back to the question, right?

634
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
So yeah, I mean, it's a pretty well-known
environment, I guess.

635
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And yeah, well, before 20th century,
actually, that was quite normal to have

636
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,000
private money, right?

637
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Along with government's money.

638
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Well, there were many countries,
actually.

639
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:25,000
not not having central banks and
government issued money at all.

640
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So yeah, I mean, it's government's own
money is relatively a new phenomenon,

641
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
actually, historically.

642
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Okay,

643
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Hopefully enough.

644
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I mean, we can talk more about when it
comes to such topics.

645
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
We can talk for a long time, but yeah,
probably enough.

646
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I was thinking about that in relation to
stable coins, actually, as you were

647
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
talking.

648
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Well, stablecoins are also a form of
private money, issued by Tether, for

649
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
example.

650
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Yeah.

651
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And there's always questions like what's
the backing or audit ability of it.

652
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
And like, on some abstract level, it's
like, okay, well let's say you have

653
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
backing and it's like, okay, I'm sitting
on this couch and this couch can be

654
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
denominated in dollars.

655
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,000
So then can I create my own, Joe's couch
dollars that's backed by this couch and

656
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
then say, Hey everybody, we're going to
spend, Joe couch dollars.

657
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
And it has,

658
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Actually, why not?

659
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,000
It would still be better than most of
meme coins, right?

660
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Because in case of meme coins, it's not
even claimed that they're backed by

661
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
anything, right?

662
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I don't know.

663
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Social energy.

664
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Yeah, social energy, some information
phenomenon.

665
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Yeah.

666
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
How to call it?

667
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I don't know.

668
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
So some meme actually, right?

669
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I think you just say that like there's
this weird

670
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Phenomenon that's like where attention
goes I don't know energy flows and money

671
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
goes there, too So it's like memes are
constantly trying to be like give me

672
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
attention.

673
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Give me attention and the more attention
they get then People throw money at it.

674
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
So I guess in some sense, maybe Joe's
couch dollars are a little bit more

675
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
durable but it's weird because like from

676
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
If you talk to somebody that's not
familiar with blockchain or free banking,

677
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
they'll be like, hey, isn't that
counterfeiting?

678
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Like you're creating some abstract dollar
that's not quote unquote a dollar.

679
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And so I think that's ultimately where
you get a lot of friction from government

680
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
anyway, is there's probably people that
have this mindset like you're creating

681
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
artificial dollars

682
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
That we don't have the same level of
oversight and control Versus like the the

683
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
original dollar so I think that is one of
the biggest pain points probably in terms

684
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
of stable coins peg to the fiat
specifically in the US like you're

685
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
inheriting their jurisdiction in their
mindset and that's dangerous and So I even

686
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
think we're gonna see like a more

687
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
more of a split than we've already seen.

688
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
It's like, okay, you have, USDC and they
have some, regulatory support and then,

689
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
ripple is coming and they're going to
have, better licensing.

690
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So like, again, if you go back to what we
were talking about with real world assets,

691
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
it's like, you have to deal with these off
chain layers and different jurisdictions.

692
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And

693
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
like at some point it unlocks potential
utility, but it also creates a single

694
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
attack surface.

695
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
And it's like, well, maybe there's value
in that utility, but your resilience maybe

696
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
doesn't, so much exist anymore.

697
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
And that's going to be an interesting
trade off to see how people deal with that

698
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
or, approach it or don't deal with it, I
guess.

699
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I've always thought that dealing with
that layer of like jurisdictional

700
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
complexity probably makes the most sense
on another layer and the base, but that's,

701
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
that's my thought anyway.

702
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
See any good questions, kushti?

703
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
a lot of, so,

704
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Let's start with some shilling maybe.

705
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Where can we buy Ergo hats like yours
worldwide?

706
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,000
So you wanna show some store?

707
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I'm not really, I have no idea.

708
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:14,000
The internet, somebody in the chat or did
a link at some point and I bought a hat.

709
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
So hopefully you can join like, I don't
know, telegram discord, Twix, whatever

710
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
they call it now.

711
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,000
and ask, what's the latest and greatest
place to buy Ergo physical merchandise.

712
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And yeah, MewFinance is an option, but I
think MewMart has some steel, but they

713
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:43,000
have made mining great again, right?

714
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
But the question is about yours.

715
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
No, I have no idea.

716
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Do you want to sell it maybe on you?

717
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Well, do you have maybe some extra to
sell?

718
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I don't know.

719
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I bought a better one.

720
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Wanna show your supplier maybe?

721
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Oh yeah, I bought a better one like three
years ago, but I gave it to mgPai.

722
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
All right.

723
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Yeah, then let me answer a question.

724
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
How can this Ergo network interact with
other blockchain networks that use

725
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,000
different consensus algorithms?

726
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
So there are many different options here.

727
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,000
So if we are talking about, well,
proof-of-work blockchains with, let's say,

728
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:44,000
simple consensus, such as Bitcoin with its
just SHA-256 hash function being used as

729
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,000
proof-of-work function, then you can build
even a trustless relay from Bitcoin to

730
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Ergo.

731
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And actually, the prototype was built by
me at some ErgoHack back in June, I

732
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:12,000
believe.

733
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:19,000
So yeah, you can check it and by using
that trustless relay so you can

734
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:26,000
trustlessly bring Bitcoin to Ergo maybe,
right?

735
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,000
You just need to consider locking
condition on Bitcoin.

736
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
You can use, for example, well, you can
burn

737
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:42,000
bitcoin on bitcoin blockchain and
presents a proof to get some tokens on

738
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:48,000
ergo blockchain that's a proof of born
idea maybe not popular now but back in

739
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:54,000
2014 there were some

740
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:02,000
kind of ICOs or token generation events
based on proof of burn, right?

741
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And yeah, I guess a lot of Bitcoins were
burned, so they are proof of burn.

742
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
events.

743
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Then you can also bring information from
Bitcoin blockchain messages and metadata

744
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:24,000
written in OP_RETURNs outputs.

745
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
The problem is that the opposite way
doesn't work, right?

746
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:36,000
So from Ergo to Bitcoin you cannot build
trustless relay really

747
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Well, at least it's not known how to
build one because of Bitcoin limitations.

748
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:54,000
So, well, in this case, you can use
multi-signature-based solutions and here,

749
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:02,000
well, maybe Joe can tell us about Rosen
Bridge.

750
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:09,000
how it works with different blockchains
based on different consensus mechanisms.

751
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Sure.

752
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Well, you basically are kind of
abstracting that off the chain, at least

753
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
with Rosen Bridge.

754
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
So you're creating, scanners that are
reading and posting data between two

755
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
networks.

756
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
So you kind of have an intermediary layer

757
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Yeah, there's a lot of different
potential ways to

758
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Connect in different environments.

759
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I would recommend that, if you want to
look at how Rosen Bridge works, we have a

760
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
lot of documentation on the website.

761
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,000
You can also join the channel and kind of
dive in to kind of the different chains

762
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:52,000
that we connect to and, how they operate,
what their assumptions are, because we

763
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
always have to have a footprint in like
whatever their consensus or finality

764
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,000
process looks like.

765
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
So it's it's a little bit different in a
way if you're looking at like the

766
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
assumptions of settlement from system to
system to system.

767
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
But there's a lot of different ways these
can connect.

768
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I like Rosen Bridge's design because like
from my perspective, it treats assets more

769
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
like assets versus just information.

770
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Like there's a lot of bridges that more
or less pass information or

771
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:36,000
proofs of something versus go through
like a redundant auditing process like you

772
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:43,000
would expect with money itself versus kind
of like information relaying any other

773
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:50,000
questions on there that that makes sense
to you kushti oh a lot of questions oh we

774
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:57,000
are out of time so

775
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:02,000
you think one question, one more
question.

776
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Yeah.

777
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Pick whatever's random.

778
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Oh, there is one awesome question about
identity.

779
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,000
But yeah, it's about 20 minutes probably
to answer.

780
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
So ask next time.

781
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Just copy paste this question.

782
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Currently we are out of time.

783
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Some questions about Rosen Bridge or
maybe let's pick something for both of us.

784
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Yeah.

785
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
So yeah, please copy paste.

786
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Well, paste during the next time, please.

787
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Wait, wait, wait.

788
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:10,000
What's the answer?

789
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
How can we tokenize consumable
commodities?

790
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Probably also quite involved, right?

791
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:27,000
How much Kraken is asking for Ergo
listing?

792
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I don't know about any ask.

793
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:43,000
thoughts on aliens oh we don't have time
for serious questions even sorry ask the

794
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:51,000
hard questions yeah that's good hard
questions yeah we had some great questions

795
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:59,000
today

796
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
It's things that if you just kept talking
about it.

797
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

798
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
So government and money.

799
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Yeah.

800
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
So it was really hard question among
others, but we don't have time for hard

801
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
questions as well.

802
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
So what to do?

803
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Maybe, yeah, let's, let's talk if that's
time.

804
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:35,000
What's the answer?

805
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
kushti.

806
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Will you be taken a well earned break
over Christmas?

807
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
How's about that?

808
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I don't know.

809
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Yeah, that's a good one from just a
little bit better.

810
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Probably not.

811
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I'll cook some food.

812
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
It's not that hard at least.

813
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:03,000
yeah do i take a break over christmas no
i'll i'll take a day cook some food have

814
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:10,000
family you're you're on the orthodox you
get to january christmas right january 7th

815
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:17,000
and yeah then also night of six but yeah
it's it's pretty much the same plan so

816
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:24,000
usually yeah i'm i'm going to church on

817
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:35,000
January 6th night and then yeah well
taking rest for half a day on 7th and yeah

818
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:44,000
that's it basically then you continue to
work yeah nice food day though hopefully

819
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:53,000
you got good stuff cooking over there yeah
so yeah

01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:00,000
It's usually about, yeah, you can have
something like duck or turkey, so maybe

821
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,000

824
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:21,000
