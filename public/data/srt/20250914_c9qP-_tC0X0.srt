1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Welcome, welcome to the second weekly
Community Ergo AMA.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The new format that we're hosting
involves everybody here, which means if

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
you show up, be prepared to either ask
questions or listen or be asked questions.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Because it's an AMA for everybody and
it's a community and that's how it works.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We've got a nice crowd today with
Dmitriy, kushti, Byron and Anax, Anthony,

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Grayman, Lex, Darkenberg, FAKU and Odi
Bocha.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So this is going to be great that
everybody's here. Thanks so much for

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
coming.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What's new guys? Anybody?

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
kushti, you're muted.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Nice company here. Yeah, a lot of new
face also.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It is great to see. We've got, Odie
actually just took over, if you can see,

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
where is he in this chart? He's over
there. Way over there. There, my finger's

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
pointing. He just took over the Sigmanauts
Twitter.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So hopefully we see some activity back
out of that Twitter. It's been dormant for

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
a little bit. So very excited to see what
he's going to bring to the table there.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hopefully some eye vote for spiciness.
Some people don't like spiciness, but I

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
think that's the purpose. I think that
account can handle some things like that

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
that the main account potentially can't.
So looking forward to seeing what's coming

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
out of there.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
How's your week been, guys?

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, also nothing bad in spiciness,
right? So it's actually attractive. Yeah,

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
that's at some point creating dramas, but
the dramas unavoidable anyway, probably,

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
right?

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It is, it is.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So why to have boring dramas if you can
have spicy dramas.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh boy, we'll see what Odi does later
today. He's just going to delete the

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
account like Joe does, just done. Oh, boy.
Yeah, no, that account could use some

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
dusting off, that's for sure. It's always
been through the hands of several people.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And everybody that's touched it has done
a great job and brought something

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
different and new. And I think everybody,
last I checked, everybody that's used it

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
still has access to it. So there's about
five people that can post it once and have

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
different voices. And it's a community
account. It perfectly fits that bill, so

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
looking forward to that, Odie. See what
you bring to the table.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What's new on my part? It's been a busy
week here around. We've had my airport

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
bots actually went offline for a week or
two, and I had to bring those back up.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There was some NGINX issue.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But infra machines are in the back of my
car, all boxed up that I showed you last

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
week and ready to be shipped out. I just
have to swing by USPS on the way home by

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
today, tomorrow, Friday. So those guys
should see that and we'll get an increase

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
to the P2P.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Infrastructure, I spoke with Mark Glasgow
over the week, and I think the next target

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
is to infra the ergoplatform.org website
completely, ergoplatform.com, simply

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
because Google charges us right up the ass
for hosting. It's pretty bad. So if we can

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
infer that and get that off that, that'll
save a cost to the EF and move it to the

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
community, which is fantastic.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Slowly moving in that direction. And on a
side note as well for the educational

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
stuff that we were talking about last
week, I've further integrated more LLMs

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
into at least my school side here. So
getting more practice to what it's going

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
to be like in automation when we finally
move on to doing that with Ergo platform

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
content and videos and all that kind of
stuff.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So really looking forward to that, but
I'm pacing myself. I don't want to start

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
another task before we finish up and get
the infrastructure DAO fully stabilized.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So yeah, trying to pace that up.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What about you guys? kushti, what's new?

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So busy, as usual, composing some text
also will post in the main Telegram chat

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
just after the call. So other than that,
yeah, so busy developing and managing

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:01,000
developers in different ways, different
projects. So yeah, that's more or less it.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's bang through the dev updates that
were yesterday real quick. I'll read them

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
off and maybe there's something to chat
about there.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
All right. Incoming screen share, folks.
There we go. All right. So kushti

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
yesterday, 9.06 AM, Ergo protocol and
reference client RND.

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We reviewed 6.0 changes in Node, made PR
with some minor improvements, polished and

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
proposed for review second PR. Towards sub
blocks now in Sigma SDK, will be merged

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
after design doc discussion and approval.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Next for Sigma, plan refactoring and
extensible context to reuse our

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
programmable money engine and side chain,
off-chain environments, et cetera. And

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
testing along with Potato and improving
P2P layer for sub-blocks.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Is Potato running a DevNet, kushti, is
that what it is?

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So I'm running seed nodes and he is
joining and then reporting. Yes, some

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
issues. Yeah, well, the last one. So I'm
also joining with my nodes. So sometimes

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
it's about three nodes, sometimes two. And
yeah, well, so issues he has sometimes not

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
reproducible on my site.

74
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
kushti, how far away geologically is he
from you? I'm wondering how that affects

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
node synchronization with faster
sub-blocks.

76
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah, but I don't know. Oh, wait. So
Sydney is in Hetzner, Germany data center,

77
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
probably. And then Potato, I don't know,
probably late in America.

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Somewhat but yeah that's a good span
that's a good test i think that's my guess

79
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
yeah so but also our devnet is kind of
extreme so it has blocks every 30 seconds

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
so and yes 60 sub blocks per block so yeah
it means two sub blocks a second even so

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
it's it's quite intense

82
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh wow so you kept you kept the 30 second
pinet when you moved to devnet and applied

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
sub blocks there that's pretty extreme

84
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, but that's good for
testing also.

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah. All right. Then you got GitCircles.
You reviewed and merged a pull. You've

86
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
agreed to use Ergo addresses instead of
C256K1 and Wish You Balance is improving

87
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
implementation. Who's Wish You Balance?

88
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, so a couple of new developers, so
yeah, BroEtiquette and Wish You Balance.

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah, so Wish You Balance is actually a
good cycles idea author, and yeah,

90
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
BroEtiquette is, well, some contributor.

91
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So, yeah, I'm actually just reporting
what they are doing mostly. So, yeah, it's

92
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
the project after all. And, yeah, so
GitCircles is a project to create kind of

93
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
community currencies, but for digital
development communities where you get

94
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
tokens for committing to some
repositories.

95
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And yeah, so we will start testing,
creating well, talking manually and doing

96
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
some testing transactions manually also,
just like few days and then yeah, the

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
development is going on. So there is a Git
bot already done as well as persistence

98
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,000
layer. So the next step is some GitHub
application and the Ergo half chain site.

99
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And you think this would ever be able to
implement something like a DAO integration

100
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
into Git circles to where if something is
approved on a DAO, if a merge request from

101
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
a GitHub repository is approved on the DAO
vote, then an off-chain bot executes a

102
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
push or a pull for that GitHub PR request
automatically kind of thing. Yeah, so PRs

103
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
are then voted on in the DAO, and then the
off-chain bot executes that push, that

104
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
change.

105
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So actually, open source communities
already acting as DAOs, right, just

106
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
off-chain. Usually some rules, some
maintainers, which are accepting what's

107
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
going to be merged into the main code
base, right? And then everyone can come

108
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and propose a pull request, but not every
pull request would be merged and so on.

109
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Then, yeah, well, it's kind of like hard
topic rights, governance and open source

110
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
communities. For example, Linux rights,
it's hard to imagine still 30 years after

111
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
its development without the single leader.
So it's a big question how Linux would be

112
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
developed without Linux right tools. And
so on.

113
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So yeah, the same dependency is typical
for many open source communities. Yeah,

114
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,000
sometimes even programming languages and
so on. But yeah, well, in some cases, it's

115
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:12,000
more or less polycentric like bitcoin
rights where there are like five

116
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:21,000
developers yeah maybe the different number
now which can merge

117
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And yeah, there is no single leader
officially, right? But yeah, in practice,

118
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
it's about one or two guys, after all, who
are making the most major decisions.

119
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's typical for DAOs, on-chain DAOs
also, right?

120
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So when you have DAOs usually, yeah,
there are some, how to say, opinion

121
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
leaders, right? So it's actually a quite
interesting topic. So would it make sense

122
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
to bring already existing kind of DAO
structures like open source communities on

123
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
chain, right? And to try to build on-chain
DAOs or not, maybe off-chain options are

124
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
more flexible actually.

125
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What was that, Grayman?

126
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I was just saying they barely get
anything done. I mean, look at all this

127
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
debate over the OP_RETURNs issue. It's not
like they're, you know, significantly

128
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
changing the structure of the thing. When
is Bitcoin going to get to 1.0?

129
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah, but sometimes I think people are
dramatic there just to get a feeling of

130
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
importance right and also get recognized
for more and then church for her

131
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,000
consultancy and her appearance at
conferences and so on.

132
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So yeah, well, I witnessed the first
OP_RETURNs drama a little bit back in

133
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:22,000
2014-15. And yeah, it also was more or
less the same, so a lot of unnecessary

134
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:31,000
dramatic talks and yeah, so some guys
hitting the discussions on purpose, I

135
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
guess, in order to get more recognition.

136
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
There's also just the drama of the big
blocks and the schism, right? And it's all

137
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
just over one little parameter. It's not
like it's substantially changing the

138
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
nature of the technology.

139
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Before NIPoPoWs, Ergo was different than
it is now. That changed things in a very

140
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
substantial way because it enables light
clients that have full security. So now my

141
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
phone can be used without the same
assumptions that come from spooling up a

142
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
lightning channel.

143
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And so how would anything like that be
implemented in Bitcoin given their current

144
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
governance and way of developing things?

145
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah, probably. No chance in Ergo. Yeah,
so we have NIPoPoWs support from day one,

146
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
right? So just, well, support and clients
was lagging for some time, but yeah, the

147
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
core structure was there.

148
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But yeah, well, for Bitcoin, there are
talks since 2012 about doing QTX or

149
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:03,000
commitments, which are allowing for
actually a lot of protocols and blockchain

150
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:12,000
pruning and support for light clients,
even if they still have to download all

151
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:21,000
the headers. In the absence of, new
proposals, but, yeah, still, because all

152
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:30,000
the energy spent on, some constants, like
block size.

153
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It feels like we're still in our age of
heroes, part of development and that it's

154
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
very hard to put that into a box of
governance and you know, eventually you've

155
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
got to get there. I hear what you're
saying. Ultimately, the goal is to write

156
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
yourself out of a job so that you're no
longer necessary.

157
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
But there are a number of people in this
community that are really carrying a lot

158
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
of water up the hill. And that kind of is
the way it has to be. It sort of self

159
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
forms a government and people ask each
other for help.

160
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Because we don't have VC funding, so we
don't have daddy that we go to and ask to

161
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
keep handing out dollar bills for us to go
and buy some new machine or do some new

162
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
approach. We just have each other. And so
the governance kind of self forms.

163
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But in the long run, if you end up like
Bitcoin, it's just ossified. It's

164
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
controlled by a group of people that
everybody agrees are sufficiently

165
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
undemanding and unchallenging that you can
just argue about things like OP_RETURNs

166
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and not have the thing grow or change. And
they'll say that that's because they just

167
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
want to be conservative. But Bitcoin's
unfinished and getting pretty old.

168
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah, and, yeah, so in, in early, years,
2009, 10, so yeah, they, they actually,

169
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,000
were quite. Yeah, quite radical even,
right? About changes. But then, yeah,

170
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
well, endless wars started and they ended
up with the current state where it's not

171
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
possible to change anything in the
protocol, basically. Especially if not

172
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
proposed by certain developers.

173
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Like one or two of them. So, yeah, so
it's quite interesting. But yeah, in case

174
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
of VCs, I think it's simple, right? So, I
mean, there is some organization which is

175
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
paying developers and making all the
decisions. But then, yeah, it's not, it's

176
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's not about community, right? So if
such term is used, so it's a little bit

177
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
fake community always, I think. Right. And
yeah, it's always controlled by who is

178
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
signing checks.

179
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Hey, guys. I wanted to add something a
bit about community. First of all, it's

180
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
super great to talk to you all because I
have been following for a very long time.

181
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And now it's super great to speak and at
least to be a little bit more in person

182
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
with you than usually on Twitter or
somewhere else.

183
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The project that I've been building is
MindHealer. And what I wanted to point out

184
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
is that building was one thing, and now
the most important part is marketing and

185
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
community. And it's a whole different
story, and it has its own challenges.

186
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And the challenges are pretty unexpected,
not what I was thinking it would be.

187
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Provided that I'm also a therapist and I
have lots of connections and friends, and

188
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I thought it would have been much easier.
But people are very reluctant because of

189
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
this impression, because of this, you
know, what people usually think about

190
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
cryptocurrencies, like scam or something
else.

191
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And those who don't have any experience,
they are very reluctant to join and to

192
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
try. And so what I'm currently thinking of
is that we have one-to-one calls at

193
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
MindHealer. So people can have one-to-one
consultations. And what I'm doing right

194
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
now is there would be group calls as well.

195
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So they could have like seminars or
something like that. And my goal is to to

196
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
make maybe some three educational classes
about ergo for specialists who would come

197
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
so they will have understanding how it
works etc etc and over time they will

198
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
start using it more and more.

199
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But something that the community could be
really interested in is that I was

200
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
thinking, since there is such huge demand
on money that is decentralized, that is

201
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
not attached to this or that country,
maybe we should try and accelerate some

202
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
adoption because, for instance, I'm
currently in Brazil, but I've lived in

203
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
several countries.

204
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And it's super hard when you move to a
different country because you have to buy

205
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
a different SIM card. Work with banks. In
Brazil, banks can close your account

206
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
anytime without any without anything. They
just closed the account saying, you know,

207
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
we had maybe you didn't pay your taxes,
maybe something else. So we closed your

208
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
account. Why? Well, I don't know. Just go
to the bank and ask them.

209
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And it's, well, that's the way things
are. And when you move from country to

210
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
country over time, it's a really huge,
huge difficulty. So what I thought maybe

211
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
we could try and again, with the
community, try to increase the community.

212
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So there are some bloggers who could
potentially be very helpful, who could

213
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
work for us the way, who could do the same
job for us that Roger Ver did in 2012 for

214
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Bitcoin. So they could be ambassadors
filming how they onboard people into Ergo,

215
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
something like that.

216
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Again, it's for community to think about
it. But I really like the idea, and I

217
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
suggest that in the Russian Telegram
group. And people are kind of interesting,

218
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
interesting, not sure. So currently I'm
asking, and let's see how it goes with the

219
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
bloggers, I mean.

220
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You're suggesting hiring bloggers and
that kind of thing?

221
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Maybe hiring, maybe inviting them to join
the community so they would promote Ergo,

222
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
kind of like reality shows.

223
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So things that I found that those people
have zero interest unless you feed them

224
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
funds and money. That's what I've run
across with actually every outreach. There

225
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
are a few, like when we started the, when
dev updates a couple of years ago, I

226
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
started trying to just get influencers as
interviewers.

227
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It was kind of a tactic to be like, hey,
come talk about crypto in your sphere and

228
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
what it's like, and also try to educate
them on Ergo in the meantime. And it was

229
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
interesting talking to some of these
people. And most of the people, or

230
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
actually all of the people I talked to,
were more on the up and coming kind of

231
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
thing.

232
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You know, from the Cardano side at least,
trying to get that kind of exposure. Even,

233
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
what can I say? There's very little time
or interest that they have unless there's

234
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
something in it for them. I guess there's
a kind way to say it, right?

235
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So it's hard to convince somebody like
that to be altruistic and come to a

236
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
project that is altruistic and open
source, right? And peer to peer, where

237
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
there's no site for them in the future to
potentially make a ton of money off it.

238
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That's what I found. So it's a tough
balance.

239
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Like look at how much Cardano paid SNEC
or whoever on Cardano paid, SNEC paid,

240
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
what's that guy's name, that influencer
with the long hair that he cut short

241
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
recently. Like they paid him, I think the
number is 40 grand, I think I heard

242
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
secretly that the number was $40,000.

243
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yeah, exactly. They paid him 40-50 grand
to start promoting SNK and probably gave

244
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
him a bunch of SNK as well. So is it worth
it?

245
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I don't know. But that's about so-called
crypto bloggers, crypto KOLs, right? And

246
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
usually those are totally retarded and
greedy bastards and yeah they're not

247
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
creating valuable content even right but
see if I understand the Dimitri's idea

248
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
right so the idea is to have some
borderless enthusiasts also bloggers right

249
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and do some videos like how i make my
money with just gpu right then how i can

250
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
bring it to africa right latin america
without well any control and then use

251
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,000
there

252
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I can mine my digital gold but yeah I can
also add... I can also convert it to

253
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
stable value, right? Using stable coins,
well, gold packs, USD packs. And yeah,

254
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
well, also it's possible to do a crown
funding, right? For a blogger. Because

255
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
yeah, well, many of them are actually
doing something like the day trips. I

256
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
mean, they're like travel bloggers.

257
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The issue isn't necessarily all with
KOLs, it's that the popularity for KOLs

258
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
exists, right? So the issue is 90% of the
communities in crypto, and I don't know,

259
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
maybe even more, they're of the mindset of
we're playing with casinos, right?

260
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I mean, look at this. It's so disgusting
that look at the incident that happened

261
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
yesterday in the US with the
assassination. There were gosh darn meme

262
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
coins that were tripping off at $1.5
million in volume with this guy's name on

263
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
it that just got assassinated. That's what
these KOLs are targeting. They're

264
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
targeting get rich casinos.

265
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:17,000
But the point is that there is no need to
spend energy, time and money on those

266
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,000
so-called crypto people. The idea is to
get ordinary people to trust some

267
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:33,000
decentralized money.

268
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Because the issue is that those calls,
well, aside of some, well, Bitcoin boxes,

269
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:53,000
right, with like big experience, right,
some of this, so usually they are getting

270
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:03,000
checks from VCs rights to promote some,
well, not so decentralized, let's say

271
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:13,000
politely, kinds of assets, right?

272
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So, yeah, the idea is to avoid this at
all and, yeah, attach to like ordinary

273
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
people. Because, well, we cannot fight,
right, with so-called crypto. We can just

274
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
build some alternative or original,
actually, vision, right?

275
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Right, right. So that's a thought,
kushti. When you get a baseline with what

276
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Dmitriy is talking about, you have to try
to understand right from the get-go who

277
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
we're trying to attract. Are we trying to
attract more like buying people like us

278
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
who are in crypto for the decentralized
peer-to-peer nature of what ergo is and

279
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
what crypto should be. Or are we trying to
attract people to pump the price of ergo,

280
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
right? So if that's established at the
beginning, then you can target who you

281
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
want speaking for it.

282
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I wanted to tell you about the audience
that I was keeping in mind. So I dropped a

283
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
link to one of the guys that I got in
touch with, and why I got in touch with

284
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
that guy, because there is a huge... I
mean, I just was thinking about one

285
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
community. I'm Russian, so I was thinking
about Russian community, Russian-speaking

286
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
community.

287
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
What's very particular about it is that
there is a huge, several hundred thousand

288
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
people who want money that is not attached
to any particular government. They just

289
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
want money. They sometimes want to sell an
apartment here and buy it there. So their

290
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
needs are very basic.

291
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And all they know is they know about
Binance and how to use it. That's the best

292
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
case scenario. Sometimes they know even
less. They don't know anything about

293
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
decentralization. They don't know anything
about this. So they basically want money.

294
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And I was thinking about the audience,
and those trial bloggers, they really

295
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
don't know the difference between
centralized and decentralized. We can

296
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
basically showcase Ergo to a new audience
and to show that it is cheap. People can

297
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
make money transfers, they can use it. And
then little by little, we can educate them

298
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
through those bloggers.

299
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Again, we can do it differently. We
should target bloggers that are not

300
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
exposed to crypto at all. So they might
have a wallet for donations, but nothing

301
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
more than that. And we can make
competition for bloggers because people

302
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
who travel, they are not usually very...
So their prices are not very high, let's

303
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
put it like that.

304
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And we can make a competition, for
instance, best explanatory video of how to

305
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
install an Ergo Wallet app and how to pay
for something on the road or something

306
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
like that.

307
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yeah, that stuff works well, I think. And
kushti also spoke a little bit about the

308
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
other method, too. And you were touching
on this, too, Dmitriy, where you're not

309
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
necessarily getting an influencer, but
you're finding a leader of a project

310
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
somewhere in another country that could
utilize decentralized finance and then

311
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
maybe make them a mouthpiece for it
online, not just for Ergo, but for

312
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
utilizing decentralized peer-to-peer
finance to accomplish what they're doing

313
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and using Ergo in the meantime to do it.

314
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So I think, yeah. Those are great. Those
are great ideas.

315
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah but also, so, yeah. Had a talk with,
Wish You Balance, again, GitCircles, guy

316
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,000
recently. So yeah, what's, the plan, right
is to, yeah, first to test it and then, to

317
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:04,000
do kind of an airdrop to existing
developer communities, right?

318
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So in the first place to some Rust
framework building communities for

319
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:21,000
frameworks used in it's circles and so on.
All right, so the idea is to issue token,

320
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,000
right, and to invite people to get them
and well, yeah, then it's at least

321
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,000
contribution. Accounting kind of tool,
right?

322
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:46,000
But then, yeah, it's not that hard to
start to attach economies, right? Well,

323
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
invite sponsors, draw some sponsors and so
on. I'm willing to put some money maybe

324
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
into liquidity pools just, right? Well,
you can just reuse existing tooling. And

325
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,000
so on. But yeah, the idea is to target
developers, right? Not crypto people

326
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:14,000
because, well, what's the point in dealing
with so-called crypto?

327
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I mean, it's just you know, when you are
dealing with people in crypto, it's mostly

328
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:35,000
like a competition who is louder, who is
shouting a marketing buzz at the most

329
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:45,000
noisy level. And yeah, it's better to grab
people from outside, right? And bring to

330
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:55,000
build, especially developers, right? Bring
to build new economies.

331
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Ben, you don't have to raise your hand.
Just jump in, man. It's community.

332
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Well, so I don't necessarily want to
change the subject, but I want to shift

333
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,000
the focus a little bit. When I'm on X and
I see an ergo raffle for trying to do a

334
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Maxi listing, which I think was one of the
ones that was up there the last couple of

335
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,000
months, there's something in maybe this is
because I'm not crypto enough.

336
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But I think being here is something. But
if I was able to Apple pay $10 from my

337
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
bank account to an ergo raffle, I would
participate in 10 times the ergo raffles

338
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,000
that I already participate in, right?

339
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And it's also like if I could just Apple
pay to an ergo raffle, it kind of turns

340
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:59,000
into more of a go fund me thing rather
than, hey, I need to see this raffle. I

341
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:07,000
need to remember this raffle. Then I need
to go to Coinbase, I need to buy some sort

342
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:15,000
of coin and then I need to go to another
exchange to swap that from whatever coin I

343
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,000
chose to ERG and then finally I need to
shift that from the exchange platform to

344
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:31,000
my ergo wallet and then get that money to
the ergo raffle.

345
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
In one, this is a it's more of a, hey, I
want to support the ergo community, but I

346
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
don't want to go through 30 minutes of
problems to be able to donate $10 to this

347
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,000
raffle. So is there a way that you can and
once again, I'm not a super dev or

348
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
anything. I can't do this, right?

349
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But is there a way that we can make it so
that you could kind of turn ergo raffle

350
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
into a GoFundMe type platform, but also
have it have ergo branding to increase

351
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
brand awareness?

352
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Because the problem in crypto and
particularly with ergo, is nobody knows

353
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
what it is. I mean, there's a few of us
who, I mean, for me, it was in 2021, I

354
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
heard the Charles Hoskinson Lex Friedman
podcast. He mentioned Ergo. In about 2022,

355
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I started really getting into Ergo and
believed in the mission.

356
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So I got my first set of ergo i've been a
part of the community in the last few

357
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:57,000
months i've kind of fallen off because you
know sometimes real life gets in the way

358
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:05,000
of of you know my crypto journey but it's
like the the issue isn't with

359
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,000
The community size, it's too complicated
to be an ergo user, simply put. Back in

360
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:20,000
the day, I was buying ADA on Coinbase.
sending it to KuCoin, swapping my ADA for

361
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Ergo on KuCoin, sending it to my wallet.
And then it's like, am I really going to

362
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,000
go through all that effort and then donate
my Ergo?

363
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Maybe I'm just speaking in circles. I
don't know if anyone has anything to add

364
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
off of that, but it's simply put, it's too
difficult to be an Ergo user.

365
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So you're in the US, I assume, Ben?

366
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Yeah.

367
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yeah. So when I first got into Ergo as
well, Ergo felt like a scarce resource,

368
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
right? Because it was a pain to get into
the US. And I'm from New York, which is

369
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
even more restrictive, right? I had to use
a Florida address from my wife's account

370
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
that lived there to purchase Ergo from
Coinbase early on, or ADA, and then do the

371
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
same path you did until they cut us off
KuCoin.

372
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So there's an accessibility issue right
there. I agree. But my question is to you,

373
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
what do we how are we framing that? So
there's no accountability in raffles where

374
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
there's something like Apple PayLink with
cash, right?

375
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So let's take, for example, that Ergo
raffle setup where you could donate ERGs

376
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
or here's an Apple PayLink to a cash
account, right? On Ergo raffle, we can see

377
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
exactly what happens to the ERG after the
raffle finishes. It goes to a wallet. It's

378
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
used. It's locked. Whatever who's using it
kind of thing. And with raffle two we'll

379
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
see tokens be able to do that as well. But
with the fiat there's no trail

380
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
accountability or anything right. I guess
you could demand that you see it here on

381
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
chain after that or or what it's used for
some accountants it's

382
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And I appreciate your sentiment towards
transparency. But at a certain point, it's

383
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,000
like, we trust that GoFundMe is going to
send the funds that we send to GoFundMe to

384
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
the user. And I know this is a big thing.
You shouldn't trust. You should verify.

385
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
But at a certain point, when does
verification become an inhibitor towards

386
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
growth of a product.

387
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Right, so I can see immediately when you
were speaking, ideas came to mind, like,

388
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
if we want to reach the broader community
as a Sigmanauts and we're fundraising for

389
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
something like the Ergo Meetup, I agree.
There could be, you know, here's a raffle

390
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
to fundraise this and here's a GoFundMe as
well for people who want to donate fiat.

391
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So I think that's a great idea, for sure.
But here's the problem. The base of your

392
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
idea is accessibility, which, you know,
it's always been a strain, a rough thing

393
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
for Ergo, for sure.

394
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yeah, I also think... Yeah, sorry. Go
ahead, man.

395
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
No, go ahead. Go ahead.

396
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So I think this is the perfect example,
actually. And yeah, it makes sense to

397
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,000
maybe make a list, right, of such like
tests, right, for accessibility. And then,

398
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
yeah, so for Ruffle, in particular, also,
what's doable?

399
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So I think, well, not sure when but this
is achievable so first we need for raffle

400
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:48,000
version 2 right to have stable coins and
then yeah some breach where you can get

401
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:57,000
stable coins supported on ergo in exchange
of Apple Pay payments, right?

402
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
But as Grayman said in comments, so yeah,
that there is HQ already with the VoltPay.

403
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So maybe is it supporting Apple Pay?
Probably not, right?

404
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
No, it does not. Yeah, well, and you can
get gift cards out. But yeah, we go from

405
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,000
the conventional financial world and into
ergo. then Banksa is our best bet in the

406
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
United States currently.

407
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It's not outrageous the way that they
operate, but setting up something so that

408
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
you could just click a button and have
your $10 Apple Pay go into a raffle I

409
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,000
mean, it's just UI, UX development. The
fact that the backend is a raffle is good

410
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
for traceability. That doesn't need to be
in conflict.

411
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
In fact, it could just be a value add,
but it's not being added to anything right

412
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
now because in order to participate in an
Ergo raffle, you have to be an Ergonaut.

413
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
You have to hold Ergo in a wallet and
understand how to use it.

414
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I think Ben's making some good points.
And I applaud you for going out on a limb

415
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
and doing that, Ben, on video, because we
need somebody to stand up from that

416
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
perspective.

417
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And say, hey, look, this is not about the
latest technical nuance so much as it is

418
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
about making it super easy to get people
involved. I also like what Dmitriy was

419
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
saying earlier. At first, I was sort of
dismissing it, but then I got his point.

420
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Let's talk to communities outside of Ergo
and get those people to be interested for

421
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
a variety of reasons and that'll you know
any any way that you can connect the real

422
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
world and other communities into it that's
great but then ben said hey look that's

423
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
all well and good but then they're going
to have to go through this process of

424
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
setting up a wallet and all these other
things it's a friction that we need to

425
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
overcome and the only way to overcome it
is to

426
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Apply lubricant, right? And that's a UI
UX dev issue, and that's hard to do. You

427
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
know, kushti's given me the thumbs up here
because you can't push a rope. I mean,

428
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,000
he's developing, you know, the next
innovations in the core and the node.

429
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It's hard for him to switch from that
into being somebody that writes a bot that

430
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
works with X to press a button and then
suddenly you get an Apple pay that goes to

431
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
a particular, all you have to do is sign
it, right? That would be nice, but it has

432
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
to be done.

433
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Sounds like a skill issue for kushti.

434
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
We need to get HQ on this call. Where has
he been? He's probably with his little

435
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
one.

436
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
He's in Pakistan probably still.

437
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Interesting.

438
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Yeah, helping some victims of floods.

439
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
The floods there are outrageous. Yeah,
outrageous, crazy. Himalayas are some of

440
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
the newest mountains in the world, and boy
are they unstable. When it rains hard, it

441
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
is hell to pay.

442
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So I'm interested to do a test, really. I
think there's probably some fundraising

443
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
opportunities and the things we can do.

444
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Oh, sorry.

445
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
No, no, I think it'd be neat. I think,
Ben, I think we're gonna, I think I'll

446
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
integrate that into at least the tech side
of Next Ergo Raffle that the SIGs do is do

447
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
a side go fund me for it for fiat users
and we'll see what happens. I think it's a

448
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
good idea, see what happens.

449
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I mean, I'm ready to take criticism by
like, oh, you're a crypto group and you're

450
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
still using fiat to direct fiat payments
kind of thing. So that's fine, I think,

451
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
but yeah.

452
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Well, it's also like, the fact of the
matter is crypto is great, and I love the

453
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
idea in the community, but God is it a
pain in the ass to use. If I could, I'd go

454
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,000
to the local pizza shop and pay with my
ERG. That'd be great. But that's so many

455
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
steps. That's why when

456
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I haven't kept up with this, but Tabi
POS, that was super interesting to me. It

457
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:42,000
was like the first real, and I don't know
what the deal with Tabi POS is currently,

458
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,000
but it was the first real blockchain
product that I saw that was like, oh, this

459
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,000
is actually useful in real life.

460
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,000
It's like, you know, DEXes are cool, kind
of useless to a regular person. A lot of

461
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
these things are really, and I understand
that DEXes are important on the backend to

462
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
make a lot of things work. I get that. But
to a regular user, to a regular person, no

463
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,000
one cares about a DEX.

464
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Like, my dad, for example, isn't going to
be like, oh, my God, look at all these

465
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
features that this really cool DEX on Ergo
has, right? That's not taking away from

466
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
the quality of these things, right? But
it's just a fact that

467
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
60-something-year-old people

468
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Who see Bitcoin and they're like, oh my
God, Bitcoin's a way for me to preserve my

469
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
wealth over time. Great, but then you get
like, that's like layer one, and then

470
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
like, ergo's down here at like layer
seven. And I appreciate ergo for being at

471
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
layer seven, but the layman,

472
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Is just like money Bitcoin, money
Bitcoin, money Bitcoin. And they're never

473
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
going to use their Bitcoin in real life.

474
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Right, Ben. So Ergo's had that, that's a
good reality check. I think Ergo's

475
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
slightly aware of that and Devs are, and
you'll see that in some of the products

476
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
that come out, is that they are
transparent to the user, right?

477
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
So like MGPi's team was originally
working on a ticketing system that allows

478
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
concert tickets and things, Lilium, right?
So that you could, you know, you could

479
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
have on-chain governance of your ticket
system. And the normal user wouldn't know.

480
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
They just download an app that had an
integrated wallet that passed the tokens

481
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
back and forth kind of thing.

482
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So I agree. I think when developers
develop, they should keep that in mind,

483
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
especially in Ergo, that people might not
want to know that they're holding Ergo per

484
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
se, but they want to know that they're
holding a product. They're using a product

485
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
that uses some crazy stable security and
peer-to-peer network that their data and

486
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
their value is safe.

487
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Yeah. And once again, I'm speaking out of
hand because I don't have the experience

488
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
to implement any of this. So if any of
this is bullshit, I'm sure some of it can

489
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,000
be. But it's, hey, you get them in with
the Apple Pay GoFundMe type thing. And

490
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,000
then that gives you the opportunity to
educate people, meeting them where they

491
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
are, rather than trying to...

492
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It's like if I'm in New York City and
you're in, I don't know, Woodstock, New

493
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
York, it's like, how am I going to get you
from Woodstock to New York City? It's, I

494
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
don't even know you, right? Like, I'm not
gonna be like, hey, come to New York City

495
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
and you're gonna come to New York City.
That's not gonna happen.

496
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Well, you brought up some really good
points, Ben. Likewise, the Grayman about

497
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
the stuff he was saying. But I think it's
more or less a product of the time,

498
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
because if you rewind time, older people
kind of had a distaste for the internet.

499
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Now, if you log on to Facebook, that's
where they hang out.

500
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So I think it's more of a UI thing, like
what Grayman would say is the ease of

501
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
access. And then also to what qx() was
saying about the criticism from going from

502
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
fiat real to dual purpose. I don't see
that as a valid criticism at all, because

503
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
for us to even get into Ergo, you have to
go from your bank account to dual purpose,

504
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
right?

505
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
So it's like, using Ben's point, which is
a good point. That's not a criticism

506
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
because people are They already if you're
donating to a go fund me. It's a purpose

507
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
attached to that go fund me So I don't
even see it as a valid criticism to say

508
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
that hey people want to use their dollars
for their ecosystem debt So that's not

509
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
even a valid criticism to me.

510
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It's a medium of exchange I'm excited to
try that method out Byron. I think it

511
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
would be an experiment

512
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Yeah, so, from our developers point of
view, I think, well, there are, multiple,

513
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,000
steps still right to, to get to the, but
so possible after all. So, what's needs

514
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
probably is, to. Yeah, well, maybe at
least what steps are needed now, right,

515
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
and then reduce one by one.

516
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So I think with Ruffle version 2, it
would be better already, right, with

517
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:02,000
stable coin support. But then, yeah, well,
there is need for more bridges, right, to

518
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:12,000
get from Apple Pay in particular to stable
coins on Ergo. After all, it's possible.

519
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I think there needs to be an easier
version of something like, what's the name

520
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
of, what's the name of bisque? There needs
to be an easier version of bisque, but for

521
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
fiat, right? So essentially imagine,
imagine a GoFundMe as an on-ramp, right?

522
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So everybody donates a certain amount to
GoFundMe, a hundred bucks. So you call it

523
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
the DCA GoFundMe, right? Dollar cost
averaging GoFundMe. Everybody donates $100

524
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
and puts their address in their donation
comment. And then some party or some DAO

525
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
is then in control of that GoFundMe and
then brings that liquidity on chain and

526
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
deposits the DCA into the person's wallets
that they designated on the GoFundMe.

527
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
So there's probably some legal
implications involved there, but I'm sure

528
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
there's a country that can handle that
where this crypto is not tracked or taxed

529
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
as far as that goes. Things like that
would be a really easy entry point for

530
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Apple Pay users on GoFundMe.

531
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It might be a little more expensive to
get on chain, but you could say, yep,

532
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
here's a DCA GoFundMe. It rolls every
month. Every month we push it out and get

533
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
in with how many ever dollar, $10
increments that you can, and we'll put it

534
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
up there. I think that things like that
would be very interesting.

535
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Yeah, sorry.

536
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I was just going to say that if I could
buy an ERG on Coinbase, I'd pay a pretty

537
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,000
premium to be able to buy that ERG on
Coinbase.

538
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Have you tried Banksa?

539
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,000
What? Have you tried Banksa, the new Fiat
OnRamp wallet integration?

540
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,000
No. To be honest with you, I have been
focused on real life. So two years ago, I

541
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,000
got really unhealthy. And that's when I
was at maximum crypto mode. I was just in

542
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,000
my basement all the time. 45 pounds
heavier than I am right now like I was

543
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,000
just super unhealthy and since then I've
kind of Not stepped away from crypto like

544
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I still hold all my crypto but Like slowly
I've been getting back into it so I have

545
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
no idea what's going on right now But it's
like Even if there is this new Fiat on

546
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,000
ramp

547
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
If I have to make an account, I don't
want to do that. I'd rather pay an extra

548
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
10, 15 cents per ERG than make a new
account somewhere.

549
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
You know what I mean? Interesting. Yeah,
gotcha. I hear you. Yeah. I think people

550
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
who have been in crypto for a while forget
about that.

551
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
If you think back to when you first got
into crypto, I remember thinking, if I

552
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
want to be in ADA, if I want to be in
Ethereum, if I want to be in Ergo, I hate

553
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
the thought of having three wallets and 20
different seed phrases and that kind of

554
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
thing. It bugged the hell out of me. I
wanted to see everything in one spot.

555
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
And that's a big attraction of central
exchanges to new users, right? Now that

556
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
we've been in crypto for many, many years,
that doesn't bug me very much at all. It's

557
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
just how it works. But we can't forget
that. You're right, Ben. That's very

558
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
attractive to new users that you just log
in somewhere. There's all your stuff with

559
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
many different chains. You don't even have
to know they're different chains and going

560
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
from there.

561
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Byron, your hand's up. Go for it. No need
to raise your hand. Just jump in. Be rude.

562
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Interrupt. Go for it.

563
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,000
You scared me. Maybe it's an accident.
He's like, oh shit. I didn't mean to have

564
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
my hand up. I think it's connections
lagging a little bit, perhaps.

565
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,000
But yeah, while he chimes in, I was going
to jump in and say like, Bitcoin's been

566
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,000
around for how many years and the ease of
using it to pay today is still a barrier,

567
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,000
no matter how popular it is. So I think
it's more or less a function of time than

568
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
like, you know so it's like the criticisms
is kind of i get it though i definitely

569
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,000
get it

570
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Yeah guys let me ask you something it's
just a theoretical question in terms of

571
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
difficulty of development. So we have
Rosen Bridge. And for instance, there is

572
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
an Ergo raffle. And is it possible to
invite people to participate in a raffle

573
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
or in crowdfunding something via Rosen
Bridge so they wouldn't have so they would

574
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
be able to pay like with Bitcoin to take
part into or with something else?

575
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
If the liquidity pools existed 100%, you
could even make all the things end up on

576
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Ergo if you wanted to. So you could
essentially have a...

577
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Thank you, Randy.

578
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,000
All right, so we got our first troll of
the show. Luckily we have his face. We

579
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,000
could post it somewhere and shame him.
What an asshole.

580
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Anyway, moving on.

581
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
That might also just be some video that
he put up there.

582
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's not his, I'm sure. I
know. He was white. He was white. The

583
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
person in the video was not white.

584
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Why is there a video on his phone?

585
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I think maybe we ought to cut the feed
for YouTube before we get in trouble. I

586
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
don't know. It's already there.

587
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Andy can clip it. Andy can clip it. It's
not a big deal. All right. So before I was

588
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
distracted, I even forgot what the hell I
was going to say. Dmitriy, what were you

589
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
saying?

590
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Oh, yes. So some, yeah, so cross-chain.

591
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Yeah, so as long as the liquidity is
available on both sides, Dmitriy, so let's

592
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
say you want to do a raffle and broadcast
Ethereum, Binance, all those things, but

593
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
you want to use the funds on Ergo. As long
as those liquidity pools exist, then Rosen

594
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
could develop, essentially, except tokens
and Ethereum. It goes into a wallet and

595
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
then automatically transfers across the
bridge at the end of the raffle once it

596
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
knows that it's a certain amount.

597
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
So yeah, development-wise, it's totally
possible and would be totally neat. Or you

598
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
could, yeah, yeah, that would be really
neat. Yeah. I'm still a little

599
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
shell-shocked from that. It's 10 o'clock.
Maybe we should end on a good point.

600
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
No, don't end it yet. I want to do an
advertisement that will tie it all

601
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
together.

602
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:43,000
It's for the Autolykos DAO and Venture
Capital Collective, which is formed

603
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:51,000
recently on Ergo. It's a project being led
by LifeOfIFA. And it's an experiment in

604
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:59,000
doing governance on chain in ergo in a
sort of standard corporate form.

605
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
And it's a situation where there's a
token, which is called Lykos, which

606
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
essentially represents a share in this
enterprise. And it's been through the seed

607
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
round. The next round is the sow round.
And then the round after that is where we

608
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
start funding projects.

609
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,000
And the first project is a payment
gateway. And I think there have been a

610
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
number of things that we need to take into
account when we end up developing a spec

611
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
for that, one of them being that mixing
would be involved.

612
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
But I think another would be that it
would actually be a way to accept and

613
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
process payment from Fiat into any other
currency, I guess, again, assuming that

614
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
you've got the liquidity to support that.
So that's my little advertisement for

615
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Autolykos.

616
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:06,000
It's permissionless, so you don't need my
permission to join, but maybe some

617
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,000
encouragement. The So Round's coming up
soon, so keep an eye out for it.

618
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Awesome.

619
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Very cool. And I think we missed those
two things I just want to mention as well

620
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
that we missed on the dev update. Nautilus
wallet has some stuff that came out.

621
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
FleetSDK upgrades. Nautilus is
investigating ledger connection issue.

622
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Machina Finance is finishing limit orders
on unit tests.

623
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Also, with speaking of spam, like we just
had spam troll just now. Ergo's had a

624
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
couple airdrops recently of fake tokens or
tokens that lead you to a fake site that

625
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
want to try to get you to connect your
wallet to.

626
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
So just a reminder to everybody that
Nautilus has those baked in, ignore spam

627
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,000
tokens, ignore NSFW tokens, because those
come as well. So if you have those

628
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
clicked, and I think they're clicked by
default, the Sigmanauts and Ergo Explorer

629
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
communities mark

630
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Tokens of spam as they come in and
they're automatically hidden from your

631
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
wallet so you'll never even see them if
you utilize Nautilus for that. And then

632
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
you can use Terminus wallet a mobile
wallet to burn them if you want to as well

633
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
which is great and I think you has a burn
option on their site as well if I'm not

634
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
mistaken. So just keep in mind

635
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Nautilus is also going to integrate on
that community list, we're going to start

636
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
putting addresses there that are known
scammers so that when you send, when you

637
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
try to send funds to a known scammer
address that the community's marked as a

638
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
known scanner,

639
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Nautilus won't stop you per se, but the
idea is to pop up a little message that

640
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
says, hey, buddy, this address has been
marked by the community as a known asshole

641
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
or a known scammer or whatever. Are you
sure you want to do this? And maybe a

642
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
default check to no, and then you have to
yes and confirm it kind of thing.

643
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,000
So that's a new thing coming out of
Nautilus at some point in the future with

644
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,000
these community lists. If you are up at 3
a.m. and you recognize that a spam token

645
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
went out and nobody else is awake, go
ahead and submit a PR to our GitHub or go

646
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
to ErgExplorer and find that token and
mark it as a scam as well or pop it in

647
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
chat. Someone will take care of it this
morning. We're a community and it's up to

648
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
us to keep each other safe for that kind
of thing.

649
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
All right, everybody.

650
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Actually, there are more updates. There
is also a reworked basis contract and we

651
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
have some new developers contributing
there as well. Yeah, well, let's discuss

652
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
during the next call maybe.

653
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Yeah, yeah, there's Basis right there.
There's Cyberverse Update Report as well.

654
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Cyberverse and Moja. So yeah, let's
discuss during the next call.

655
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Yeah, sounds good.

656
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It's always awesome to talk about Ergo.
Every week, man. I hope to see you every

657
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
week, man. Come in. It's awesome to have
your opinion.

658
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
And join Autolykos, man.

659
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Come talk to us on the radio.

660
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Dude, I have to find my Ergo seed phrase
first.

661
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Uh-oh.

662
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Create a new wallet and send your shit to
it.

663
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Well, that requires me finding my seed
phrase first. I think I got logged out of

664
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Nautilus.

665
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Oh. Okay. No, I'm not.

666
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I'm not logged out of Nautilus. Great. So
make a new wallet and send it ASAP.

667
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Yeah. Yep. Yep.

668
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And everybody go to Colorado if you can.

669
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Yes, I'm going to announce the first two
speakers. I'll announce maybe today or

670
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
tomorrow, the third speaker, three out of
three out of the six speakers or seven

671
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
speakers we have. Please come. It's going
to be a lot of fun. We're going to live

672
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
stream everything, but we'd love to have
you guys here in person.

673
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
The Twitter stuff.

674
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Yes, thank you, Odi. August, October 11th
then. So people are showing up Friday,

675
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,000
October 11th is Saturday, and then there's
a breakfast, community breakfast thing on

676
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Sunday as well if people are still around.
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

677
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Later. And everybody check out Dmitriy,
oh, he just left. He was developed, oh,

678
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,000
he's right there, your picture boy. Ah,
here, I'm here. Mind healer as well. I

679
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:28,000
poked around it kind of thing, but super,
super interesting idea, neat idea.

680
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Thanks, thanks. Yeah, so let's discuss
MindHealer maybe also.

681
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Yeah, hop into DevChat and talk about it
as well. Yeah, Grayman. Grayman will bring

682
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,000
it down. There's not enough ERG in the
world to support Grayman sessions.

683
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
All right, everybody, it's been awesome.
I love these community talks. I think

684
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
they're a step up in what ergo is, so
fantastic. kushti, any closing words?

685
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Awesome atmosphere. Very pleasant talk.
Let's continue next week.

686
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Great.

687
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Ciao.

688
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Thanks everyone.
