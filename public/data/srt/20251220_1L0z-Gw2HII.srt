1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
All right, we are live.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello and welcome to a late night special
episode with everybody's favorite ergonaut

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Joseph Arminio.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Joe, it's a pleasure to be here with you
tonight. How you doing?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Pretty good. I think you oversold me
there.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Did I? No, no, no.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We are live. Hell no. I don't think so,
sir.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I just checked our stream. Our stream's
working. That's a good sign, right? I'm

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
going to post it in chat to see who's
there.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Perfect. All right. I've got my water
glass to make sure that I have enough

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
hydration during this chat.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You got some apple juice there, Joe?

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Perfect. Nothing like Colorado apple
juice made from the fresh Colorado apple

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
trees.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We have some somewhere.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Perfect. All right, Joe, how's it going?
How do you feel in this? What's it called?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You know, I was talking to Glasgow today
and I was like, if you listen to some

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
people out there in the space, most of the
time, I've been so busy lately with Ergo,

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
with the infrastructure now trying to move
machines around, trying to get them off

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
centralized like Hetzner servers or
unreliable cloud flare load balancing,

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
that kind of thing. You pick up your head
once in a while and you listen to these

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
guys. It's like the freaking world's
fallen. It's like, what are you guys

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
looking at? Because I'm seeing these
structures that we're building that are

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
absolutely fantastic. What the hell are
they seeing, Joe?

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Well, most people don't run
infrastructure. I don't know how else to

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
say it. Crypto has moved pretty far beyond
this idea of peer-to-peer networks and the

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
space has only gotten dumber and dumber
and dumber as people don't localhost

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
anything. And so they care less and less
about what they're running and why they're

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
running what they're running. And it just
becomes like a leveraged form of

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
speculation. I can't, I don't really deal
with that crowd. I try not to because you

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
look at Rosen, right. Project I work on.
You want to be a watcher. If you want to

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
be a watcher, you need to run it, right?

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Not only do you need to run it, Joe, but
you need to run it. You need to pay

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
attention. You need to make sure that you
want to make a profit off it. You want to

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
get all those transactions recorded and
get that funding from there. You got to

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
pay it. You got to upgrade when the
upgrades come.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You got to make sure it's running. You
got to run it. You look at Lithos, the

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
same thing, it's software. So if you want
to use it, you got to run it, right? And

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
so if I get a hard time from people that
don't really run anything, I don't know

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
what to tell them. At that point,
everything is just a ticker, a letter

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
subject to price charts over a five, ten,
twenty minute timeframe, I don't know, a

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
week timeframe. Well, if you're trying to
build stuff, you're running

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
infrastructure, your mindset's just a lot
longer, right? So there's a certain

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
disconnect between this idea of like being
a peer in the network, or a network

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
anyway, versus just being like a user or
investor. And it's a different mentality.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I am what I am, right? So I just ignore
it. Honestly, I just ignore it and then

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
like, well, what am I building? I know why
I'm building what I'm building. And that

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
makes me happy. Like if you take Lithos,
right? It's like, OK, the most interesting

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
property in proof of work is that anyone
anywhere can silently compute, submit a

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
block, get a reward. There's no cap.
There's no artificial bound set of actors

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
that can build blocks. It's just anyone,
anywhere at any time that has the energy

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and hardware. You would think that a
system like that, in theory, could be

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
quite efficient in terms of having as many
block producers as possible. But you run

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
into this economic incentive issue where
if you're solo mining, you are in essence

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
playing the lottery where you're going to
win every once in a while, but you're not

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
going to win a lot.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You play the law of averages there,
right?

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It just depends on the size of the
network, right? Every once in a while

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
there's someone with a BitAxe that throws
out a Bitcoin block. That's pretty cool to

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
see.

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh, did you see the article about those?
There were these little, some of those

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
little things with LED screens like the
lottery miners, right, for Bitcoin. Come

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
to find out all it did was play a basic
image on the screen animation and the rest

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
was just bullshit. Just like selling
paperweights for people to plug in and

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
burn a tiny bit of electricity and feel
like...

66
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's almost like open source code is
important.

67
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Almost, right?

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah, I think there was even someone that
was using like NiceHash, renting some hash

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
rate and decided to play the lottery and
hit a Bitcoin block, which is pretty damn

70
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
cool. Anyway, so what is Lithos designed
to do? It's we're trying to put everything

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
on chain so that everybody can build their
own blocks. Simple as that. And that's

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
something that because you have a huge set
of people that they're not peers, they

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
don't run anything, right? What they run
is their phone on CoinGecko or

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
CoinMarketCap and rotate, hop around,
chase whatever the flavor of the day is. I

75
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
can't handle that mentality. I would be
too stressed.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I get it. I think the separation I have
there, Joe, is that's fine. If you want to

77
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
speculate on tokens and do that kind of
thing, that's great. Try to make profit

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
off stuff. Try to make honest profit off
stuff. Arbitrage. Use the toolings that we

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
have to do that. But I really get hot and
pissy about value extraction. One of those

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
things, if you come into a project and
your number one goal is to extract as much

81
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
value from it as you can for your own
pockets instead of building up and being

82
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
part of it and growing that, that's when
you're going to hear from me and probably

83
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
not for long because I'm probably not
going to talk to you for much longer than

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
that.

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You're nicer than me. At the end of the
day, you're nicer than me. Whenever I run

86
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
into that, I just tell people pain is the
best teacher.

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That is true. That is true.

88
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Pain is going to teach you better than I
ever could. And whenever in my life,

89
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
whenever I have a problem, I run into
something and I have to hit my head

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
against the wall to figure it out. It's a
powerful, powerful teacher. So there's a

91
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
lot of people that in crypto they've
chased whatever. Whatever cartoon, meme,

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
pump fun stuff is out there. They got
burned. Pain is a teacher, right?

93
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
My hope is, too, that we can at least
show them some resemblance of usefulness

94
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and what the blockchain is about. So even
if they do get burnt, they can at least

95
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
say, Ergo had something cool. Ergo had
something cool. They're actually using it

96
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
for this. This is what they're doing. Let
me just peek into that a little bit. So

97
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
maybe there's some hope of light there
that we're at least projecting into

98
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
people's eyes when they come by.

99
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Crypto was a lot better when there were a
lot more miners because people were

100
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
actually running things, right? And we've
shifted so far away to like everything is

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
delegated through someone else some other
service some other person some other pool

102
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and you get further and further and
further away from like being a peer that

103
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
for a lot of things, that's just the
marketing, right? Because it's like, okay,

104
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
well, if you have information that's
flowing between the point of like order

105
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
execution and the user, and you have the
ability to see that as it's moving before

106
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
it gets there, that is information that
has value, right? So you do see a lot of

107
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
VCs actually just doing like more
infrastructure plays. Hey, maybe we can

108
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
create a wallet, and they're probably not
making money from the fees, I'm gonna

109
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
assume, right? It is what it is like that
that is why you want to be a peer in these

110
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
networks is because you have the ability
to run your own transactions You have the

111
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
ability to run your own software.

112
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah, I always have this fantasy, not
fantasy but I was of this idea of miners

113
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
as the digital farmers of the world right
like you look at I think I use a

114
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
comparison of like I imagine a futuristic
miner of a blockchain that sustains their

115
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
family perhaps with the transaction fees
and and the rewards like you look at like

116
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
the kind of futuristic outfits like in
Star Wars those half underground houses.

117
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
They have all this machinery and they're
out with their moisture condenser things

118
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
that they're doing. So same kind of thing.
I feel like what other industry can you

119
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
literally go out and get consumer goods?
And when I say consumer goods, I mean

120
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
definitely with Ergo, right? Because we're
ASIC resistant and you can use consumer

121
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
level video cards. What other industry can
you go out there, build your way up,

122
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
create something in your own environment
here, control it, point it where you want

123
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
to, do what you want to, run a solo if you
want to, and reap the benefits of that and

124
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
also contribute to the network.

125
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I tend to look at proof of work from the
perspective that it's most optimized

126
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
whenever there's excess capacity, right?
We've already seen that in Bitcoin, where

127
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
you have like flare off gas mining, and
they'll try to build their miners close to

128
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
power infrastructure points, and then load
cycle the output. I do think that as more

129
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
people get like there's going to be a lot
of developers out there. They're going to

130
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
have their little GPU rig for AI, right?
They're going to have a lot of big AI data

131
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
centers that have cold capacity, right? I
think these things naturally plug in

132
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
really well to GPU proof of work.

133
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Even when people realize that AI
companies aren't making money right now

134
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and they're cooking up books and it's
actually good.

135
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The amount of leverage that they're
taking on to scale is fucking wild, right?

136
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Crazy. It really is wild. And then it's
like, okay, well, for in the first order,

137
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
right, you have capacity, right? Where
let's say the popular LLMs, what

138
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
percentage are they actually running hot
in that data center versus what is like

139
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
cold storage that is in essence waiting to
come online when demand peaks? That's an

140
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
interesting question. I don't actually
know the answer to that across different

141
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
systems. But then you have kind of the
second order effects, which is like this

142
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
cutthroat competition to always have the
best hardware, right? Because that is

143
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
something that's going to lead to better
models is better hardware. And then it's

144
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
like okay well realistically you take I
don't know the H100 how many years is it

145
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
going to have before it then passes on to
like a secondary market secondary life and

146
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
at that point you're upgrading these
facilities and installing new hardware and

147
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
at some point those are going to recycle
out. And they do trickle down, right?

148
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
They do trickle. And speaking in more
nuance than that, Joe, it's just like ASIC

149
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
miners, right? It's in the interest of the
people creating these chips to flood at

150
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
least a small sector of the market for a
discounted price. So let's say you flood

151
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
1% of the market with a discounted price,
right? For these chips and also these

152
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
chips are now beating the pants off every
other chip out there in the market, right?

153
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Because there are older chips out there in
the market. Now everybody's going to buy

154
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
your chips to catch up and you have that
rat race going there too. So it's

155
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
absolutely corporate driven in these
circumstances.

156
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah, and then you have a guy on the
mountain that it's like, hey, if I can buy

157
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
an extra 3060 and plug it into my solar
system when I'm running at excess

158
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
capacity, why not mine a little bit,
right? Eventually, that'll pay itself off.

159
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And I've already invested all this stuff
in power for my house. So why wouldn't I

160
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
want to just take that excess capacity
that I have and do something with it,

161
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
right? I actually personally. One of these
days, I've always wanted to hook the solar

162
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
up to a little mining rig, heat a
greenhouse, then I get food. Then I'm just

163
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
passing on that excess and the different
outputs that are beneficial to my reality.

164
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You have enough panels to run your whole
house, Joe?

165
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's not a ton of power, but yeah.

166
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You can run a beer fridge and a grill
probably, right? That's enough.

167
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I don't need an electric grill out here.
Just start a fire. I mean, those type of

168
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
setups I think are the most interesting
thing where it's like, OK, you have the

169
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
ability to capture heat. You have the
ability to capture excess power

170
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
production. You have the ability to like
capture cold computational power with GPU

171
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
mining and that's huge because if you look
at the actual hardware on the ground

172
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
that's scaling right there's going to be
probably more.

173
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The dollar values in GPU added into our
economy then the entire Bitcoin market cap

174
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and people are I don't understand I don't
understand why there's not why there's not

175
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
startup companies going around right now
to all these facilities saying look we can

176
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
increase your profit margins by 10% if you
do these kind of recapture processes with

177
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
heat with with extra electricity on mining
other things I can't believe nobody's

178
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
tried that yet.

179
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I honestly believe that that sort of
thing will come. It'll just be the

180
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
natural, when the incentives there and
someone realizes it and chases it, there's

181
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
a lot to do there, right? Is it something
that I think about every once in a while?

182
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah, I mean, I've made an article, I
don't know, six months ago, like, here's

183
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
how you would optimize Autolykos and make
a sigma chain that's for clusters, right?

184
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Is that something I actively want to
chase? Not really, but I always come back

185
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
to it when I look at all the hardware
that's coming online and I'm like, wow,

186
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
this is not running at full capacity. Now,
there are Bitcoiners that are like, hey,

187
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
you know what you should do is you should
buy ASICs and then plug them in and then

188
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
you can mine Bitcoin and also like balance
your power for all this other computer

189
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
equipment that might have another use,
right? And I'm just waiting. I think it's

190
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
better to just focus on Lithos because if
that type of mining does come online and

191
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
you do have that type of solution where
all of these different centers and users

192
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
can potentially build their own block
template, produce their own blocks, that

193
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
would be really cool because it would be
more decentralized. I do think mining

194
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
pools have been terrible for Nakamoto's
consensus and proof of work. Absolute

195
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
shit, right? I get why they exist. But
even on Bitcoin, you have things like

196
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Ocean showing up that are quite
interesting projects. Now, it's funny that

197
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
when I build on Bitcoin with Ergo stuff,
Rosen, we're validating off-chain. And

198
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
when we're working on the mining stuff on
Ergo, we're validating everything from the

199
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
mining pool on-chain. But then you can
look at Ocean is validating everything

200
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
off-chain. You can do what you can do. But
I do think that there's a lot of really

201
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
interesting potential for GPU just because
of the net amount of hardware that's going

202
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
to come online in the next 10 years. It
makes no sense to have a data center,

203
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
right? I mean, let's say you own a
business, right? And it's like, okay,

204
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
you've invested all of this money in
developing this data center, buying these

205
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
cards, setting up the power
infrastructure, et cetera. And you

206
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
probably have pretty damn good power
prices. If you have any common sense,

207
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
that's why you placed your center where
you did, right? And you have a lot of

208
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
leverage debt that you've taken on to
scale. And you're basically burning your

209
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
cards at some floating rate like it's not
that hard to say okay what can you create

210
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
some sort of like micro controlling
software that just balances proof of work

211
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
with demand right then you're always
running hot all the time. and you're

212
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
getting as much value out of your hardware
stack as you can. I think that makes

213
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
sense. It doesn't take a lot of extra
capital expenditure versus Bitcoin mining.

214
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And the truth is, most of the value of
Bitcoin has been captured a long time ago

215
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
by miners. So I think there might be some
interesting things with like super cluster

216
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
mining and that type of proof of work. And
I think if we can break the dominance of

217
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
mining pools, that's where things get
interesting. That's where you have a

218
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
really decentralized global system where
you have all of these different actors,

219
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
potentially building their blocks and
submitting it to the chain. So I'm

220
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
excited.

221
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I mean, I do hope. Initially, Autolykos
was used for to resist mining pools,

222
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
right? Initially with Ergo, was that the
deal? You didn't want mining pools.

223
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Well, mining pools are pretty toxic in
terms of the security assumptions, right?

224
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Bitcoin, it's like three entities that
control block production and like that's

225
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
terrible. But nonetheless, you have all of
these individual miners that do have like

226
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
local custody of their hardware. They are
running their own power. It's just a

227
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
matter of where they're pointing it, but
they don't necessarily understand how he

228
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
who controls order flow, like controls
everything in markets. And when you have

229
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
just a basic payment system, it doesn't
really matter, right? Like on Bitcoin,

230
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
it's like, okay, if I send it to you and
it's mined in this block or five blocks

231
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
from now, it's just going from Alice to
Bob and who really cares. But when you

232
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
start building markets on these systems,
right? where it's like okay well now you

233
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
have race conditions now you have DeFi
like now you have this like competition on

234
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
top of the blocks where you're constantly
trying to arbitrage or race for the better

235
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
price, the better trade, suddenly this
ability to control order flows is massive

236
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
in terms of the economic power that you're
controlling versus just Alice to Bob who

237
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
gives a fuck, wait 10 minutes. Sit down,
go outside, have a cigarette, it'll get

238
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
there next block. Versus when it's like,
hey, you have to pay back your collateral

239
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
or you're going to get liquidated, right?
Then suddenly it's an entirely different

240
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
ballgame.

241
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So now, but with Lithos, right? The
individual miners are going to have to be

242
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
more in tune to that and pay more
attention to stocking blocks and stacking

243
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
them full of transactions.

244
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah, I think there's some really
interesting potential like in terms of

245
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
building markets, right? Because that's
ultimately what you want, is to build free

246
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
markets on top of these systems. Or it's
like, OK, well, can we create channels for

247
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
me to submit a transaction to you, the
miner, through Mixnet for privacy? So I

248
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
never broadcast my IP address, right? And
then pay for a priority fee for you to

249
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
mine it. Or can we create these other
layers of markets for priority fees in

250
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
DeFi, et cetera, where you're passing on
value to the people building blocks,

251
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
right? I think there's a lot to build on
there. You may even have Demurage

252
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
potential. Storage rent has come online
enough to where it is actually releasing

253
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
DeFi operators.

254
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yeah, for sure.

255
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You think we'll see other chains adopt
Demurage after the fact, Joe?

256
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's really dirty, too, in my opinion.
Pretty rough assumptions to throw on a

257
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
chain. I'll get on like Twitter or X or
whatever the fuck people are called these

258
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
days, and I'll talk about Demurage,
because I do think that it's a really

259
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
clean solution in terms of like UTXO state
management, right? So suddenly you have

260
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
this live set of UTXOs that just moves
forward in time. That's really a beautiful

261
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
system that Alex came up with. You have
supply availability become some things

262
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
that you can accurately project forward
through time versus supply availability.

263
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Bitcoin is unknown because it's until you
sign your transaction, who knows if you

264
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
lost your key. And then you have something
like Solana, where they just find a

265
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
fucking bunch of coins somewhere else. And
they're like, oh, yeah, sorry, guys, we

266
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
forgot about that. Right. What was it?

267
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It was a chain that we minted. Was that
the chain that we minted like a massive

268
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
amount?

269
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You always have some weird fuck. Yeah.
That was they have a stadium in L.A. It's

270
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
an exchange out west.

271
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I live in the mountains, man. I don't
care.

272
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's closer to you than me, sir.

273
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
But no, I honestly think like supply
supply integrity, and the ability to

274
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
predict like the available supply is
incredibly important for a monetary

275
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
system. Right? That seems really, really
basic. And you do have crazy fucking

276
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
projects that are like, oh yeah, we're
just gonna fork and change the amount.

277
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
We're just gonna increase the cap and then
maybe we'll increase the cap again. And

278
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
you gotta ask like, at that point, do you
have a debt ceiling versus a supply cap?

279
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Or you randomly find a bunch of coins
somewhere else. How the fuck does that

280
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
work? That seems to not be very sound
monetary policy. Let's just say that.

281
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It doesn't seem to dissuade some users
from still utilizing the product though,

282
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Joe.

283
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Well, yeah. Listen, man, some people will
take the long bet and then they'll just

284
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
try to back their money, right? I don't
think they actually care. I don't think

285
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
they're running software. I think they
have chips on the table, so at that point,

286
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
red is better than black, obviously,
because their money's on red, right?

287
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah, true, true, true. I think Luca
wants to come join us. Let's see if

288
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
he's...

289
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I'd love to see Luca.

290
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's see what he says.
I accidentally left the old Zoom link at

291
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
the bottom of the YouTube video. Send him
one. Bring him up here. He may have been

292
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
bluffing. We're calling his bluff. It's
okay. I don't want to intrude. Oh, stop,

293
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Luca.

294
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Luca was my DJ when we had the Ergo
meetup. I don't know if you knew that but

295
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
he had like when it was like, at the end,
he took over the sound system and was

296
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
blasting tunes for us.

297
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Oh, nice. What am I doing here? In the
wrong thing. This is going to really jack

298
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:09,000
our interface. So bear with us, people.
I'm going to set the interface back to

299
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:19,000
just us, the whole window. So hang on one
second. Keep talking, Joe. Keep talking.

300
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Well, I'm just here for decentralized
money, man. That's it. Peer-to-peer

301
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
networks with decentralized money, right?
Think Napster, where anybody anywhere can

302
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
connect, right? I think that's the best
outcome. And people get opinionated. I

303
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
mean, bags have their own. It's no
different than red or black, right? They

304
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
put their money on red and suddenly, if
you're not red, you're dead, right? It is

305
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
what it is in this space. There's no
escaping it. It's a weird industry. But if

306
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I look at it as money, I think it's really
interesting. Ergo is we have privacy

307
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
assumptions, but we're not a privacy coin,
right? And some people will say, well,

308
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
that's a terrible idea. But if you ask
them, should we audit Fort Knox? Should we

309
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
understand what the gold supply is? Right.
They'll be like, oh, that makes sense. You

310
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
definitely would want that sort of
audibility, especially if you're trying to

311
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
be commodity backed money. Right. But even
that, like, how do we live in a reality

312
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
where that doesn't just have like a
hundred live cameras, anything happens,

313
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
everybody will know. Right. instead of
just, Oh yeah, we haven't audited it since

314
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
the seventies.

315
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I don't know, Joe. I don't know. It's
hard. Every time it gets discouraging,

316
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
especially.

317
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I know. I think you're good at staying
out of that part of it to not let it

318
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
affect you. But I can, I can... I've said
for years on these videos that it's like,

319
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
listen, I can go to the casino. I can play
poker. The drinks are free. I know the

320
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
drinks are free, right?

321
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I would much rather do that than be like,
hey the ladies are nicer looking in

322
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
person, I don't know all that. Let's see.
Here comes Luca He's gonna jump in hot

323
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Come on, right? Load Luca load load load
He is getting his camera ready You have to

324
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,000
turn your camera on Luca so we can see
you. Maybe he doesn't want his camera.

325
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
We'll put it down there. Look, at least
connect to audio buddy. All right. Well,

326
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,000
he figures out his Mike smartest
programmer around and he's, he's having

327
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Mike trouble right now. Isn't that how it
goes, Joe?

328
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Listen, that's all right.

329
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,000
He's got Luca. Can you hear us? Luca? I
see his little mic icon. Was Luca in, did

330
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Luca go to India with kushti? Did he go on
that trip?

331
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I don't think so. I think you just made
that video.

332
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Oh, OK. Oh, for stability, Nexus, right?
Yeah, that was a good video. That was a

333
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
great, that was a, it was fun. I had a lot
of FOMO for the Colorado meetup, but you

334
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
guys look like you had a lot of fun. And
you did spend twice the budget you were

335
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
supposed to, Joe.

336
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Yes. All right, Luke, I can't hear us and
we can't hear him. So he's leaving and

337
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:30,000
coming back. That's fine. We'll keep we'll
be here looking for you afterwards.

338
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
After we went to the Garden of the Gods,
I took Luca.

339
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Did you do a nice little sunset walk
holding hands kind of thing?

340
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
No, it was like dark. That's fun. Anyway,
nice spot.

341
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Nice. Very nice. Does it like darker? The
sunset was gone kind of thing. It still

342
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
looks nice. Oh, the sky's gonna look
gorgeous out there by then, right?

343
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yeah, it was beautiful.

344
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:03,000
All right, let's try this again, Luca.
We're trying to... Is he here? Luca, can

345
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:10,000
you hear us yet? Maybe this is Luca just
trolling us, Joe. Maybe Luca's like, I'm

346
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,000
going to mess with them and make them look
silly. Well, we'll keep going. All right,

347
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
what else? What else is there, Joe, going
on in this world? This has been... This

348
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,000
has been bugging me lately too, Joe. I
have... I've always had a very strong

349
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,000
dislike for the standard corporatist MBA
type, right? It's just always rubbed me

350
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
the wrong way. Again, value extraction.
Their main goal in life is to come in and

351
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
suck as much money out of everything as
possible.

352
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Make everything cheaper, shittier, and
make some money, and then fucking leak.

353
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Fucking hate it, right? They got their
golden parachute, doesn't matter. They

354
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
made their money, just move to the next
thing.

355
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
We see that everywhere in life we see
that with the you know oh there was an

356
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
amazing listen i understand i'm literally
waiting to get on an airplane and they

357
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
charge you to take a shit right that's
that's like the peak MBA.

358
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's like they sit around and they think
how can we make people's lives miserable

359
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
enough so just miserable enough so that
they want to pay a little extra. It's

360
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
fucking crazy. That stuff really pisses me
off. Like I absolutely can't stand it. So

361
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I've been in a kick lately. So for those
of you that don't know, I program in one

362
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
of the oldest languages known to man.
Perl. There's Luca. Luca, can you hear us?

363
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Yeah, we're good.

364
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Luca, what's up, buddy?

365
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
He's drinking water.

366
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
How you doing, buddy? Water, that's fine.
We are all inclusive here. We're drinking

367
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
water, too. Well, Joe's drinking apple
juice. I'm drinking water, of course. All

368
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
right, let me finish my rant. So I build
in Perl, and that also means that Claude,

369
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
ChatGPT are absolutely amazing at Perl.
They are extremely good at programming in

370
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Perl. And the amazing thing about Perl is
that you can write it to print HTML, you

371
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
can write it to print JavaScript, you can
pretty much get away with almost not quite

372
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
as sleek and amazing as some of these apps
out there that are slow and sluggish, but

373
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
like we're talking about, I made a whole
printing pickup system and backend system

374
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
that I showed on the AMA the other day.
And like the script is like a couple

375
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
thousand lines of code, it's 46 kilobytes,
it loads like this. So I've been doing a

376
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
lot of that. And whenever somebody comes
to me at Cornell, we had a lot of money

377
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
taken from us from the federal government,
right? or held back, I should say. And

378
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
then there was a deal reached where we
kind of got some of it back. The story's

379
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
online, you can read it. But we've been in
a mode of money saving recently. And it

380
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
adds up. So if you think there's five
departments in my college alone, so if you

381
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
think there's a couple people in every one
of those that are using something like

382
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
doodle poll or those kind of things where
it's like you know 20-30 bucks a month for

383
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
the pro version that you need because the
free version just gives you enough stuff

384
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
to be useful and you just need that one
extra feature but it's going to cost you

385
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
the 10-15-20 bucks yeah you got it. Yeah,
so those things have been pissing me off

386
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
royally. So anything that's like, I think
I can do and I do it. So I've made about

387
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
four or five, maybe six duplicate apps of
these. I've made a polling, like an

388
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
iClicker polling app. I've made an
attendance app. I've made a doodle poll

389
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
app, a full on schedule. It's even better
than that. So I've made a handful, maybe

390
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
even a dozen. I lost count. I have a huge
page of these things. that are geared at

391
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
being like, fuck you to these applications
that just feel like you can write

392
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
something and be a billionaire and just
nickel and dime everybody. So that leads

393
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
into my frustration in the blockchain
industry with value extraction. I guess

394
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
that's where my stories connect, but it's
just so damn frustrating. So yeah, Luca,

395
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
welcome. The amazing Luca, how are you
doing?

396
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm good. I'm okay.

397
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I heard you presented a video you sent a
video to the hackathon that kushti was at

398
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,000
in India or the presentation there that
works.

399
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
No, that was the hackathon and then there
was a workshop on the Monday like academic

400
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,000
workshop. So I presented live on the
Google Meet. So I did one presentation for

401
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Dexy, and then another one for the gluon
proofs or theorems, and then another one

402
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:17,000
for the theorems in the orb staking
protocol.

403
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
The orb staking?

404
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I've heard rumors that there's copies of
this on somebody's computer phone but I

405
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
haven't seen anything what do you mean the
video I've heard either Bruno or Alex has

406
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,000
like recording it yeah like I think when I
was on the Google meet I could see them

407
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and I think Bruno was like recording with
his phone

408
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yeah. So it's on Bruno's phone.

409
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I might share the Dexy slides in the
Telegram channel.

410
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
That'd be awesome. Oh, if you guys want
to preview, right? You've got a really

411
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
nice presentation from the Ergo Summit.
People can get their chops wet with it

412
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
before they dive into your Bruno video.

413
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Were you doing any judging on that
hackathon that they did?

414
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Oh, Luca's very judgey.

415
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I wasn't in I was in India for two days.
It's a long story.

416
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Yeah, we got lots of time. Luca, tell us
what are you doing in India?

417
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Well, I was, I was going to go to, I was
supposed to be in India for like two weeks

418
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
to go to this hackathon, like to not
participate, but like help out and then be

419
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
in the workshop in person. But I kind of
had a bad jet lag and culture shock.

420
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Are you talking about you, you drank the
hotel water and you shit yourself for two

421
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
days?

422
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:02,000
No, puked. But I thought I was getting
scammed by a travel agency.

423
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Oh, come on. Fill us in. Come on. We got
time. Come on, Luca. Tell us.

424
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So I was supposed to meet up with Bruno
at the National Museum in New Delhi. And

425
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
so I took the metro. There's poverty
everywhere. That's rough, yeah. But no,

426
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
but what's surprising is that if you see
like a homeless person in like a city in

427
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
like North America, it's odd. Or like you
feel like, like pain or feeling bad for

428
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
the person.

429
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Luca, you're from Canada, aren't you?

430
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yes.

431
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
They have homeless people in Canada.

432
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:51,000
In Montreal? Yeah, in the subway.
Especially in winter. Because warm.

433
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Yeah, but it's a little bit downhill
around here. I went out in Denver. I went

434
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
out and some dude steal my windshield
wiper and I chased him out.

435
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Why do you need your windshield wiper?
Yeah, somebody. All right. Sorry, Luca.

436
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Keep going. So it's homeless people in
America. You feel bad for me. You want to

437
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
help them. But in India, you're not
supposed to. Is that is that the idea?

438
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Well, because the poverty is like kind of
like everywhere. So it's like normal,

439
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
which is the weird. That's like the weird
thing. you're there. And it's like, Oh,

440
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
it's actually just like normal, every part
of everyday life. Which I don't know if I

441
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
could do that.

442
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I don't know if I could go there.

443
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,000
My empathy things are through the charts
and that those cases I feel so terrible.

444
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Sorry, go on, Luca.

445
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And yeah, so I go, I get to the metro
station. It brings me I take like three

446
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
rides to the train station and kind of
lost. And this tuk tuk driver, he like

447
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
talks to me. He's like, Oh, you're, you're
lost. Let me bring you to this, government

448
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
tourism info center. It'll help you find,
find your way to the national museum. So I

449
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
was like, okay, I didn't, whatever. I'll
go in the tuk tuk and that was 30 miles

450
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
out of town. No, they brought me to the
place and it's called like tourism center,

451
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
but it's not a government agency. It's a
travel agency. And yeah, the guy, I got

452
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
like pressured into buying something.

453
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
No, Luca, was it a lot? Did you lose a
lot?

454
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Well, I might get a 50% refund.

455
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Okay. Wait, is it the 50%? Is it like
crypto where you have to give 10% to get

456
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
the 50% back?

457
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
No. I might get 50%.

458
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I'm sorry, Luca Luca got real life. So
you never made it to Bruno at the museum

459
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
ever?

460
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
No, I met him. And then I got into a
driver's car. And the guy brought me to

461
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
the national museum. So I didn't meet up
with Bruno, which was cool, but I never

462
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
had to buy you a bunch of dinner. No, but
yeah, unfortunately I didn't get to meet

463
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
kushti in person, which would have been
nice.

464
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I'm so sorry, Luca. It's okay that we're
laughing at this after the fact, right?

465
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Yeah. Like, so I basically like, I got
freaked out and I got upset and left.

466
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I'm sorry, dude. That's rough. Would you
ever try it again? Would you ever go to

467
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
India again?

468
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Yeah, for sure. It's actually not so bad.
Well, New Delhi is really bad pollution.

469
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
When I came back, my shorts still stank of
the pollution. That's how bad it was.

470
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Like air pollution?

471
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yes, yes. It's worse than China. There's
like a... Forget the site. I think it's

472
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
AQI or something or air IQ. And it's like
a leaderboard of all the cities and their

473
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,000
pollution levels.

474
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And you tell these like, up five, we
should make an oracle out of that and do a

475
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
stable coin based on New Delhi pollution
air pollution. Joe get on that.

476
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I don't know if it's like, it's terrible.

477
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I can't believe you, Luca.

478
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
How's MG? I know that MG's finally almost
out of his.

479
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
He's almost done. You think he can
release our app, Luca?

480
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.

481
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Oh, you chose the wrong time to come
under this chair, Luca.

482
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I've got a question for you, Luca. In
2026, what do you do? Should we do the

483
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Ergo meetup in Colorado or should we go
out to New York?

484
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
No, no, we're going to Ithaca 2026. I got
it. We're going to do a big, we're going

485
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
to do a big thing. We're going to, we got
an auditorium. We're going to do a

486
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
conference. We're going to invite other
people, try to invite the Cornell

487
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
blockchain club. But yeah, sorry, Luca.
What's your opinion of that?

488
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,000
It's cool. I guess you like, I mean, it's
cool if it's in different places closer to

489
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,000
you, isn't it? Yeah. You could drive here
six hours, I think. Right.

490
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Yeah, I don't have a car, but it is
drivable distance.

491
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Take a rickshaw.

492
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Yeah, you should go just to hit him.

493
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Come beat me up, Luca. Sorry, it's been a
tough couple of weeks. This is good to

494
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
laugh. I'm sorry it's at your expense,
Luca. I really appreciate it, though.

495
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Well, what are you working on these days,
Luca.

496
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Yeah, what are you working on, buddy?

497
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I'm trying to launch Gluon Dollar. Tell
us there. Well, there's like things I have

498
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:11,000
to update in the contract, but I'm sort of
like, I haven't gotten around to it yet.

499
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And I found some, I did like an AI audit
with Rob from Lithos. Like I sent him the

500
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,000
contract and he like put it into the AI
and then he sent me back the output like

501
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,000
text of what it suggested. And it found
one thing that I think I missed or like,

502
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,000
but yeah, so I, and I asked Keith, Keith
from GoLend from Rosen.

503
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Yeah.

504
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Yeah. He's like, I showed him like, is
this a mistake? He's like, maybe he

505
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
probably, so yeah, it relates to Oracle
fees. Yeah. So I might have to, so it's

506
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
like, I'm not just as simple as like
changing the contract because I'm using

507
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,000
his Scala backend code, which was set up.
He set it up to like, so you can do, you

508
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,000
can like launch and you can launch the
contract again, but like, and you can

509
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,000
change like what it's pegged to and so on.
So I might have to also change like the

510
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
backend code in that application.

511
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I'm still waiting for, for the silver
Oracle that we had put together.

512
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Oh yeah, that would be cool too.

513
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm curious. I want to see Gluon and Dexy
live in the wild and just see how they,

514
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,000
see what kind of data they print. And
that'll give me a good idea in terms of

515
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
like a silver backed coin. And I don't
know, I hope at some point, maybe we can

516
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
even merge with like Silver Sense. I have
the same jacket from the Ergo Meetup.

517
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Greyman gave me a little silver dime.

518
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
He gave you a dime bag, right? Do you
bring dime bags for everybody?

519
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Yeah, it says dime bag on it, right?
That's amazing. I had like a breast pocket

520
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
on my jacket and I was in the restaurant
the other day. I pull it out and I'm like,

521
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
what? Put it on the table and it says dime
bag and the waitress is looking at it.

522
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It's Colorado. It's Colorado. That's
normal. Lots of dime bags.

523
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Yeah, I guess. But no, I'm really curious
to see how Gluon evolves. I really think

524
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
that will be interesting to to watch. I
know that I know there's a couple of

525
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
different instances now that have been put
together. But that's.

526
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So are you like, sorry, go on, go on.

527
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Yeah, with Gluon Gold, we wanted to
update... Yeah, I'm supposed to... I'm

528
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,000
confused. I'm confused myself. I'm also
supposed to update Gluon Gold. Because...

529
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Yeah, we wanted to change the reserve
ratio, so it's closer to 1. Like, is it

530
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,000
1.01? Because we noticed that it would
de-peg too fast. when people would like

531
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
use the protocol. And then also change,
one of the equations because when I was

532
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
working on proving the theorems, well, I
mentioned this at the talk in Colorado,

533
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,000
but basically like, stuff doesn't work out
properly because when you depeg, it makes

534
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,000
the reserve ratio constant. It has to be
like, it should actually be like, like

535
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
version of a line that so it's always
decreasing until it reaches one or well

536
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,000
the inverse of the reservation should be
one when or the normalized reservation

537
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,000
when r is there anyway is I don't know
like I don't get too technical here but

538
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
yeah yeah yeah hit it yeah so okay so if
you look at the glue on paper it says like

539
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
you just see an equation called Q or the
called the fusion ratio equals the minimum

540
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
of two values you have Q star and then
this number this fraction that's the

541
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
oracle price times the circulating supply
of the stable coin divided by the reserve

542
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,000
amount. So the fusion ratio, this Q
number, is like the minimum of these two

543
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,000
values. This Q star is like a protocol, a
fixed parameter. And you can think of the

544
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Q as just like the inverse of the reserve
ratio. So the reserve ratio is defined as

545
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:45,000
your reserve divided by your liabilities.
So if the reserve amount is R, right? So

546
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
the amount of ergs in the bank, the
reserve ratios are divided by your

547
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,000
liabilities, which are, which is like the,
the, the price of the stable coin times

548
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,000
the circulating supply. Because those
units will like cancel out and you'll get

549
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,000
like erg divided by erg. So it's like a
unitless constant. But the problem is that

550
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,000
so that just like you can think of like
your raw or reserve ratio value. that

551
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
you're computing, just like some raw
number that's between like zero and

552
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,000
infinity, right? But then the value, the
number that's actually used by the

553
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
protocol in the equations to compute like
how many stable coins you get when you

554
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
want to mint some, or like when you want
to convert between stable coins and

555
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
reserve coins, it computes like an
auxiliary value called the normalized

556
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,000
reserve ratio, which is the number that's
a function of this raw reserve ratio. okay

557
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:57,000
so this normalized reserve ratio that's
like the inverse of that okay that's the

558
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,000
normalized fusion ratio and that's like
this q parameter in the paper which is

559
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
like equal to the minimum of q star and
the raw inverse the raw q okay so the raw

560
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,000
inverse of the the inverse of the raw
reserve ratio. And so when it depegs, then

561
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:21,000
the fusion ratio means it becomes less
than a Q star, sorry, above Q star.

562
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Because it's like inverse, everything's
like flipped. So when the reserve ratio

563
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,000
becomes too small, that means the inverse
rate Q becomes big. So when the raw fusion

564
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:39,000
ratio becomes bigger than Q star, you're
depegged. So the minimum will be Q star.

565
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
But it's always going to be Q star when
you're depegged. And this causes a bunch

566
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,000
of problems. So you actually want it to be
so that if you're not thinking of instead

567
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
of the fusion ratio, but the reserve
ratio, when it depegs, instead of it being

568
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,000
like a straight line, it like goes down,
it always decreases. And so when it's at

569
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,000
zero, then the normalized reserve ratio is
one, and then this will like, fix the

570
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,000
problems. And what that means is, when the
reserve ratio is zero, then the price of

571
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,000
protons, reserve coins will be zero. Yeah,
anyway. It's like, it's like, it's like,

572
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,000
it's actually like simple math, like, so
high, like a high school student could

573
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:33,000
understand the math. But it's just like,
when you tie it with the concepts, that's

574
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,000
what makes it a bit confusing.

575
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
So what the so this is, this is a concept
that Bruno came up with, and then you, you

576
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
conceptualize with mathematics, or he
conceptualized the mathematics and you

577
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
implemented the code?

578
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So, so what was actually cool is like,
he's been thinking about stablecoins for a

579
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
long time. So it's based on a, so Jed,
even if you go all the way back, it's like

580
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
started off from a paper on it from
Ethereum called Staticoin. And I remember

581
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
reading it and it was confusing because I
got used to the notation that Bruno came

582
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
up with for Jed and Gluon. It's much more
intuitive. So you're like, study that

583
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Staticoin paper and then like improved
upon concepts. And then that was like what

584
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,000
that's how Jed came about. And then now
gluon is like an improved version of Jed.

585
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So yeah, he had the ideas of the papers
and then like the theorems. And I just had

586
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
to prove the theorems. And so we're like
similar to Jed.

587
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Jed's on Cardano right only Cardano right
now.

588
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
No, I meant Jed as in the paper.

589
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Oh, the paper Jed. OK, who implemented
Jed on Cardano? Is that somebody? Cody.

590
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Yeah, they did a weird job. Yeah, yeah,
yeah.

591
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Yeah, they did. Can you extrapolate on
that weird job, folks?

592
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I don't want to step in that pile. Come
on, Joe. Yeah, I think there's an article.

593
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I think there's an article about it from
the... I can't remember if I can find it.

594
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Anyway, to be honest, I think if you're
going to build JED on a proof of stake

595
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
network, you need a liquid stake
derivative to make sure that you can force

596
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
protocol returns into the treasury and
then you have natural growth. It doesn't

597
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
make any sense to build it with the native
coin. You should create a derivative of

598
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
that coin and then use whatever staking
you have from the base of that derivative

599
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
to increase the supply of the treasury and
then it grows. And I've never understood

600
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
that, but that's my own like outside
scratching my head looking saying what the

601
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
fuck are they doing over there? Which I do
that all the time in life. And sometimes

602
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
it's their issue. Sometimes I'm just an
idiot, right? That's the beauty of

603
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
learning.

604
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
So you would meant you would been shared
using the yeah, you need like the

605
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
tokenized data.

606
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Yeah. Like if you, if you could create a
derivative, right. I'm not even, I'm proof

607
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
of work, but anyway, and proof of stake,
if you create a derivative, you should

608
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
create the treasury of that coin, right.
And then direct the inflation into the

609
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
treasury of that stable coin and it would
naturally grow. Right. And that makes it a

610
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
lot easier to stabilize things when you
have like natural, like capturing

611
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
emissions, right. Because like a proof of
work asset is hard, right? Like gold, if

612
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
you sit it somewhere, it doesn't grow more
gold. And if you put it somewhere else, it

613
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
doesn't grow more gold. But proof of stake
is set up to where if you, in essence, put

614
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
your stake to work, you get more of the
coin, right? So if you have that natural,

615
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
like nominal inflation, why wouldn't you
put that into the treasury of a stable

616
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,000
coin? I don't understand.

617
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:54,000
All I hear is you're promoting proof of
stake, Joe. That's wow. That's new.

618
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Wait, wait, wait. So, okay. I was
confused because if the, so I understand

619
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
like you, the ADA, so I put, I lock up
ADA. I create this like tokenized ADA.

620
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Right? You create Gluon ADA. You lock it
one-to-one, but you stake the underlying

621
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
ADA, right? The underlying ADA. The
underlying ADA grows and then what you do

622
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,000
is you mint, Gluon ADA into the treasury
of the stablecoin and naturally your

623
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,000
treasury is absorbing inflation as your
monetary policy is inflating, right? You

624
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
can't do that with proof of work. because
proof of work is more like a commodity

625
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
where if you take a barrel of oil and you
put it in one place, it doesn't create

626
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,000
more oil, right? Put it in another place,
it doesn't create more oil, but proof of

627
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
stake is very different because you have
the ability to absorb inflation. So why

628
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
wouldn't you direct that? Why wouldn't you
create a mechanism to direct that in the

629
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
treasury of the coin to either offset the
volatility peg, which then makes it more,

630
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
like incentivized for people to take the
volatility position or use it to create

631
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
more stablecoins. Like you have a certain
like monetary hack there. Like I'm

632
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
personally not, I'm from Ergo, right?
We're proof of work. Because a barrel of

633
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
oil doesn't naturally create more oil, but
in proof of stake, it's more like shared

634
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
dilution, where you can absorb nominal
inflation and then put that to work. I've

635
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,000
never understood it, but that's my own.

636
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Where's the ADA growing from in this
circumstance, in this scenario?

637
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Just protocol inflation.

638
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Oh, wow, okay.

639
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Right? Because you can capture inflation
and emission, why not direct that into the

640
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:55,000
treasury? I've never understood that. I've
always scratched my head. You have a

641
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:01,000
certain power there that you just can't
create with a commodity-based asset. And

642
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:07,000
proof of stake isn't a commodity-based
asset anyway, but I don't know. Anyway,

643
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:13,000
sorry to derail the conversation. That's
been something I've been wandering,

644
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:19,000
watching for some time.

645
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Because in Cardano, you can like delegate
ADA in a contract to a stake pool.

646
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Yeah, yeah. And in theory, in theory, if
you were to like create a stable coin on

647
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Cardano and you were to do that, it would
be really cool to use that to, what is

648
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
that guy's name? Peyton, I believe. Like
Big Pay, he created something to like

649
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,000
split stake. If you were to create a like
liquid staking derivative that also could

650
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,000
like split the stake to underlying small
pools, that would be really good for the

651
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Nakamoto consensus on Cardano. But that's
my own, like maybe a good idea, maybe

652
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:09,000
hallucination, say.

653
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I got a question guys. We got a question
from the audience. You know, people

654
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
actually watching this at two in the
morning my time. Look, are you on my time

655
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
zone? Luca? Are you on Eastern time zone?

656
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Yeah.

657
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
What are you doing up so late? Luca? Do
you sleep?

658
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Sometimes, sometimes I was watching all
in.

659
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
All in?

660
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
All in podcast?

661
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Oh, gotcha. All right, here's a question.
Ready? If Ergo is successful in three

662
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
years from now, what will people be using
it for on a daily basis?

663
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Well, right now, if you look at what
separates Ergo from most other

664
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,000
cryptocurrencies is these derivatives that
we've created, right? So there's been a

665
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,000
lot of work that's been put into
censorship resistant DeFi versus just

666
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,000
creating the censorship enabled DeFi,
which is not really then DeFi because you

667
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,000
have an underlying party that can
essentially reverse or freeze or seize

668
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:26,000
everybody's assets. So if you look at the
total value that's locked on Ergo in DeFi

669
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,000
and how much of it is based on censorship
resistant protocols, it's basically

670
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,000
everything. versus if you look at most
other systems, it's like, oh, well, what

671
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,000
we've done is we've allowed another, we've
created a contract that allows somebody to

672
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,000
potentially rug and freeze everybody's
assets. And if you actually look, and I

673
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:56,000
would recommend everybody that's watching
this do this, if you look at USDT, right,

674
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,000
the total frozen amount, relative to the
cap of the supply is like 1.8 percent. So

675
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,000
that means that one like historically 1.8
percent of the value of their total supply

676
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:14,000
has been frozen which is fucking insane
for a currency, right? It means you you

677
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:20,000
almost have a 2% chance of just your money
disappearing. Like, okay, well, like if

678
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,000
you were to look at that as a bank, like,
okay, there's a 1.8% chance something

679
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:32,000
happens and your money's gone. Some shitty
fucking odds. Wow. Good luck.

680
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
So you say you say, sorry, go for it.
Look, what do you say to this to Ergo

681
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
three years? What are you using it for?
What's it going to be used for?

682
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Well, like I would like to use crypto. I
would like to get to a point where like

683
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,000
cryptocurrencies normalized in general and
like society in general, like you just pay

684
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,000
for things on a regular basis. That would
be really cool. I don't know that it's

685
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:05,000
going to happen in three years
necessarily.

686
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I don't think it'll happen in three
years, but I think there's a demand for

687
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
it. What does the gig economy represent?
It represents people trying to grind to

688
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
create some value to live their life well.

689
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I mean, the bottom line is we've lost
cash, guys. We're losing the ability to

690
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
use cash. We're losing the ability to
privately pay somebody without any

691
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
oversight. It's gone. It's essentially
gone, right? You go to the bank and you

692
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,000
ask for more than a couple grand and they
ask you why and they may say we don't have

693
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
that much money on us right now. I went to
the bank when I was sending money to Peru

694
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
for my wedding, trying to get out $10
grand. They're like, nah, sorry, you can't

695
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
get it out. We don't have enough here. I'm
like, what the fuck are you talking about?

696
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I hopefully people get sick enough about
that. But I don't know.

697
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I think they will, honestly. I think that
the best marketing, historically, the best

698
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:09,000
marketing for crypto has always been
government overreach, right?

699
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
It's for your protection, Joe.

700
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I don't think Luca is old enough, but QX
is definitely old enough.

701
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
How old are you, Luca? Are you 27?

702
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I'm 29.

703
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Wow. Do you remember the Cyprus bank
crisis that they went through?

704
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
What year, 97?

705
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
No, that was about 2012, 2013, I believe.

706
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Oh, the recent one.

707
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
OK. Yeah, yeah. Where they suddenly
absorbed depositors' money above a certain

708
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,000
amount. I was not aware of that.

709
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Yeah, don't worry about it. You're too
young. But QX is.

710
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I'm sure I had my head up my ass or under
a rock somewhere.

711
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Yeah, that was the point where Bitcoin
really started to take off, right? You

712
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
can't create that kind of marketing where
all of a sudden everyone's looking at a

713
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
system and saying what the fuck is going
on? Like that's outside of the parameters

714
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
of the rules that I thought I agreed to,
right?

715
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Well, actually, even even even like even
just yesterday, like today, like the

716
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
European Union, just like $90 billion
euros to fund the war in Ukraine. It's

717
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
like none of them are like elected or
whatever, whoever decided or something

718
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
like.

719
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Well, the Canadian trucker thing was
another good example, right? Oh, yeah.

720
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Where they're like, hey, suddenly we're
just going to, limit your ability to

721
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
access your bank account that's when
that's when the normal people wake up and

722
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,000
they're like what the fuck is the user
agreement that I just signed up to because

723
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,000
most people when they download software
all they do is scroll scroll scroll scroll

724
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,000
scroll scroll scroll agree right they just
try to pass on to the next like the next

725
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,000
instance in the UI in the system, they
don't give a fuck. But when suddenly like

726
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
reality wakes them up where they're like,
whoa, what the fuck is happening? Then

727
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,000
suddenly like the idea of privacy and
censorship resistant and all of that

728
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,000
become interesting. We can't create that.
Like we can't fake that as an industry in

729
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
my opinion. It'll always come from the
outside. It'll always be like a bunch of

730
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
normal people are like, wait a second,
what user agreement did I just click I

731
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,000
consent to? And why the fuck is that like
part of the system that I'm in? And the

732
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,000
more that systems overreach, I think more
people will wake up and say, wow,

733
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,000
cryptocurrency is potentially powerful
because you do have stronger assumptions

734
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
as a peer rather than just a user that has
to click a box in order to get to the next

735
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,000
screen. That's where we win. I don't think
it'll ever take over the world. I think

736
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,000
it'll just be a counter economy. But if
you have 5%, 3%, 2% that actively use

737
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,000
that, it's powerful.

738
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I think it can be sold also as, or looked
at as a hedge, right? And I don't mean

739
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
hedge as in, let's make a lot of money off
this kind of thing. A hedge as even a

740
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
one-to-one ratio, right? What other
system, even cash, right? Even cash, let's

741
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
say I have $30 grand, all right? What
other system can I put this into and know

742
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
by memorization, wherever I go, I have
access to this. If I have to get the fuck

743
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
out of Dodge, if I have to go somewhere,
if something crashes somewhere, where else

744
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,000
can I bring this with me inside my head
and still be able to execute systems of

745
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
trade with other people at some point in
time? That doesn't exist anywhere, right?

746
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
This is it.

747
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
This is kind of magic.

748
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Yeah.

749
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I will say that a lot of the time, over
the years when I've talked to like Alex,

750
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,000
have calls every once in a while talk
about what we're working on, what we're

751
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
thinking about is this idea of a neutral
settlement, right? So I don't know if

752
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,000
anybody's paying attention, but in terms
of what Luca was talking about with this

753
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Ukraine, Russia, NATO fucking drama, I was
born into it. That all started before I

754
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
arrived on this rock and I'm pretty sure
both of you as well. The idea that

755
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,000
suddenly countries are going to take other
countries' central bank reserves, that's

756
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,000
pretty fucking crazy. Because I can see
within a system, you can have a lot of

757
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
control parameters, like reversibility,
freezeability. That makes sense in terms

758
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,000
of a higher level controlling a lower
level, basically. as in a very simple like

759
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
hierarchy term, but when you're talking
about how does the United States trade

760
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
with Russia, right? When you create
digital money that has freezeability and

761
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,000
reversibility built into it, who the fuck
would want to accept that? Because they're

762
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,000
no longer equals. It's like you have a
parent-child relationship or a

763
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,000
parent-child relationship, right? So why
the fuck would anyone want to accept

764
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,000
anybody else's money if it's a
parent-child relationship? You have to

765
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,000
have some form of neutral, like medium of
exchange where you have parent to parent

766
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,000
or peer to peer relationship. And when you
have all of these systems that are

767
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,000
cropping up that are all parent to child
relationship, fuck you, I'm not a child,

768
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,000
right? Country should be saying that to
each other. People should be saying that

769
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
to each other because the bottom line is
we need to get past this reality where we

770
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,000
just scroll to the end of a user
agreement, click agree and fucking move on

771
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,000
because we don't know what type of
liability we just inherited. And it's

772
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,000
super frustrating to be like, hey, know
your assumptions, know your assumptions.

773
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,000
But when the assumptions become more
complex, you need to be either a fucking

774
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,000
lawyer or a software engineer to even
understand what the fuck they are. And I

775
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,000
think that when we get into this idea of
simplistic systems like Bitcoin or Ergo, I

776
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,000
think there's a ton of value in that long
term because you can't create a unified

777
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:22,000
reality across different countries without
peer-to-peer, parent-to-parent trade. And

778
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
one interesting thing to look at on the
market side is since And since that

779
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,000
happened with Russia, a lot of the bonds
have been shifting much more towards the

780
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
short term, right? Which means if you were
to freeze US bonds, at least it's on a

781
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
shorter duration versus long term. Now,
obviously we have, fuck knows how much

782
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,000
debt today, but I do think those neutral
assets are absolutely critical. Because

783
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:52,000
with gold, there's always been like a
human assumption. I don't give a fuck what

784
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,000
you think. I don't care what you believe.
But you know, I'll take your gold. Right?

785
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,000
That's always been a like a neutral thing
that kind of balances human trade is this

786
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,000
idea of common money. And when you have
parent child money, it's fucked. And so

787
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,000
personally, I worry about this idea of
parent-child DeFi and parent-child money.

788
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Nobody really cares. No, no, no.

789
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I mean, that's the population. Look at
all these parent-child relationships with

790
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,000
how these corporation-run stable coins are
going to be, right?

791
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Oh, even software, man. Like, why the
fuck do I need to pay a subscription to

792
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
run some fucking software?

793
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Oh, Joe, don't make me stand up. We just
talked for half hour about this.

794
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I remember when you could have a fucking
floppy disk or a CD.

795
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Money, money, money, money, make more
money.

796
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
My first mobile phone was the Google
Nexus
