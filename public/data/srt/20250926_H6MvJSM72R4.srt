00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hello and welcome to the fourth Ergo
Community AMA.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What a morning, what a morning. I rushed
to get here so we could be four minutes

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
late. How's that sound?

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We've got with us today, for starters,
from E3, we've got Grayman, kushti, Byron,

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and anybody else that wants to join in the
chat for the Ergo Affinity.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So lots of stuff happened this week,
right? We threw stones at Goliath with our

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
slingshot, I guess, again, with the HTX
saga going on. We printed some receipts

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
for the conversation we had with them,
which was, if people are not recalling, it

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
was asking for, it was plainly and clearly
taking their marketing fee and revealing

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
that it wasn't really a marketing fee
because 30,000 would buy us 14 days with

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
no delisting and 100k would delay the
delisting.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So it's very obvious in their own work.
These are extortion fees, and it's got

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
nothing to do with marketing. So it's nice
to have those receipts and publish them

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
out there. That tweet didn't get quite as
much coverage as the first tweet. I think

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
we're probably only like 15,000, 16,000
for that compared to the original tweet,

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
which has got to be over 200,000 views
now. So not quite as much, but it is what

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
it is.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So to build off that and back off that,
we created a GitHub repo where we posted

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the receipts as well as some chat logs of
that and asked the community to, not just

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
the Ergo community, but the crypto
community to post their receipts. Kind of

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
like a WikiLeaks or something like that.
And let me let somebody in the room here.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So we're hoping that people stand up for
themselves and the space and expose these

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
people that are just trying to extract
value from any project that comes along,

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
right?

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's the awful part of it. We saw one
tweet reply, I forget which project it

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
was, but same thing happened. They
actually announced that they paid $500,000

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
for a listing with HTX Global. And same
thing, they were not sent a notice about

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
being marked for special treatment, ST.
And then they got the delisting notice

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and, of course, were stonewalled and
blocked and not really communicated well

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
by their person.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So it seems like there's a systemic
method. It's quid pro quo at those places

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
where this is what happens. We put you in
a corner without letting you know really

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
not giving you a chance to meet whatever
demands that they can come up with at any

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
time they want to by the way and force
them that's on the contract and then put

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
you in a corner to where you have no
communication back to remedy anything

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
because you didn't even know you're on
special treatment list and then meet you

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
in the back room with hey here's $100,000
and you can stay delisted kind of thing,

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
you know, so it's disgusting. None of that
happened. Don't worry boss.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah, it's absolutely crazy. So hopefully
if we get more people to join up and do

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
that, that'd be great just to have those
receipts there so we can at least have a

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
repository if not in the current history
to have a repository in the future history

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
looking back of how dirty these things
were in the infancy of the industry,

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
right? So I'm really glad we have that.

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What else is new? kushti, year-round?
What's new on the developer front? What's

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
new in your corner?

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah, a lot of things. Well, sub-blocks,
DevNet progression. Feel free to join

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
maybe in a few days. Some issues to be
fixed, but not so many.

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Actually already left and yeah testing
bombing the devnet with transactions and

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:03,000
yeah well initial supports of input blocks
in mempool and the nodes wallet mostly

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
done, so yeah, proper progression there.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So yeah, also doing some more demos of
ErgoScript possibilities with coding

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:34,000
engines in form of example tests. We are
now working on global transfer policies

53
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:45,000
kind of scripts. And then also iterating
slowly our full-fledged bulletproofs

54
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:56,000
verification, which would be another nice
example of capabilities of the core

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:07,000
protocol in regards to providing a
platform for cryptographic applications.

56
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Doing also with coding agents, mostly a
demo of basis trackers of ChainCash. So

57
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:28,000
tomorrow we'll meet the developer of
Telegram wallet. So then, yeah, I think in

58
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,000
a few weeks we will have demo to be used.
Well, around different communities, like

59
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:46,000
human communities, as well as AI agents
and peer-to-peer networks.

60
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So possibly, I think in the long term to
replace many so-called DeFi

61
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
cryptocurrencies tokens because yeah well
in most cases they are not needed simply I

62
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
believe.

63
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Then yeah also we checked recently with
Git circles guys maybe they will provide

64
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:25,000
updates in developers' chats on their own.
So yeah, it's progressing well there as

65
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
well. So in like a few weeks also they
will start promoting for more once the

66
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:43,000
initial prototype is done around reddit
and other developer communities.

67
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Developing circles, different framework,
focused communities and so on. So, yeah,

68
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
it looks good. I think, well, we need to
get people from outside crypto, right,

69
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
because, well, this crypto space is now
mostly about some weirdest kinds of

70
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
speculation. So it's better to get
developers right and people willing to

71
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
build digital economies for you as well as
real worlds like local economies and so

72
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
on.

73
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Then also there were two fundraising
campaigns done. I don't quite know by whom

74
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:46,000
even but yeah well now it seems well there
are like 7000 ERG in my wallet. So 2k

75
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,000
already there and 5k will be released in a
few days. So like that, need to check. So

76
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:04,000
that's quite great. So I've assigned the
first bounty and Sigma Rust repository to

77
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:13,000
have full-fledged implementation of Ergo-3
interpreter in Rust after all, with the

78
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:22,000
help of that bounty in particular.

79
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And yeah, so we'll publish a plan on
spanning this key. Then what else we have

80
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:46,000
is Dexy-based USD stablecoin. Still
discussions mostly, but here we have a

81
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:56,000
clear plan how to deliver and all the
technical parts there, so it's mostly

82
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:06,000
about discussions, politics, holding
update keys, deciding rules about when to

83
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:16,000
burn those keys, what are the rules, and
so on.

84
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So yeah, it's mostly about humans, not
technicalities. So, yeah, I think, well,

85
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
that also would be a good problem. I
think, right, to bring people from

86
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
outside, but now from crypto, so Rich's
idea is to use it outside of their

87
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
ecosystem, mostly, right, and he uses it
mostly because of efficient arbitrage

88
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:57,000
possibilities with Dexy design.

89
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And then what else? So yeah, well, if I
go around, there are a lot of exciting

90
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
things on his side in regards with rules.

91
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So, yeah, it seems a lot of things have
been there, right?

92
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, yeah, really exciting. I know, it's
amazing. They've got a technique to bridge

93
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
it the other way too. When Rosen first
started out, some of you may not know that

94
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
typical Rosen swap from chain to chain is
you can bring coins or tokens from either

95
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
chain to either chain. But with Bitcoin,
it was a one-way bus, right? You could

96
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
bring Bitcoin to Ergo or Cardano or
Ethereum or Binance, and it would be Rosen

97
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
BTC, but nothing could go back.

98
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So they developed a technique to be able
to bring back tokens and coins onto

99
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Bitcoin itself by using the RUNE protocol.
So yeah, super, super cool, super exciting

100
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
to have that there.

101
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Does that facilitate atomic swaps?

102
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Can you atomic swap? I think you can
atomic swap runes, can't you? kushti?

103
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You mean are atomic swaps available for
our runes? I think so. There are actually

104
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:35,000
multiple atomic swaps before Bitcoin and
other e-tanks of cryptocurrency. So,

105
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:43,000
tomorrow I will join Komodo folks and they
have some atomic swap based DEXes.

106
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The only thing is, well, still those
things are not quite popular,

107
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
unfortunately, right? Well, regardless of
sovereignty and so on. Yeah, it is what it

108
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
is. So, well, I personally would be happy
to provide even some liquidity, right, and

109
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
so on. But yeah, well, it seems it's quite
complex, right, still, to do all these

110
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
things. It's not quite what we want,
unfortunately.

111
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:32,000
For Atomic Swaps, we had a demo of a
private Atomic Swap made with Bitcoin Cash

112
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:43,000
even before Bitcoin supported Schnorr
signatures. Jason Davis made a demo back

113
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:54,000
in 2020. I saw lightning swaps and so on,
but only demos. Nothing popular.

114
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Our guy Death Ergripsson made something
for atomic swaps. Yeah, I'm not sure if

115
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,000
it's finished even, but yeah, well, in
general, well, a lot of such to link

116
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:19,000
around, but yeah, mostly in prototype
form. And yeah, even if it's quite

117
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:27,000
finished, polished, it's still not that
good.

118
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah. Well, guys, let's hit a couple of
Dev updates real quick before we continue

119
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
on with the discussion.

120
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Let's see what we have here. Let me just
arrange my screen a little better.

121
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Perfect. So first up, we have Nautilus,
that's add-on BR, adding configurable

122
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
ledger transport method supports, and
Hermes, added Ergo node client, now

123
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
working on mempool tracking. kushti,
what's Hermes?

124
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I think if you go a little bit down, if
you go a little bit lower, there is

125
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
explanation about it.

126
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That's an explanation. Let's see.

127
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah, sorry. My was off. So, what's,
what's heard me by a Nautilus. What's,

128
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
what, what's sorry.

129
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Hermes right here. H E R M E S added
error client. Now working on mempool

130
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
tracking.

131
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh, yeah, maybe there is some discussion.

132
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yeah, I don't see anything. I'll have to
reach out to him. Yeah, I don't see

133
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
anything, it's you either.

134
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's a real time and mempool aware box
streamer on top of the index node. It was

135
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
initially designed for Machina Finance,
but it will be generic enough to be used

136
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
for any dApp and even to replace GraphQL
on Nautilus.

137
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So it's a Mempool streamer, is that what
you said? Nice. You know, I think MGPi and

138
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Luca built something somewhat similar.
They had to do that for SigmaLock because

139
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
they wanted instant responses from the
chain for the locking and unlocking

140
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
mechanisms. So they built some sort of
cache streamer as well for their backend.

141
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So it seems to be a need for that. That's
really awesome. Very cool.

142
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
All right, ErgoProtica R&D, the rest he
says, he's reviewing PR contract, made

143
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
code coverage for the PRD to test it, made
PR with rules for a crush coding agent,

144
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and he's asking for reviewing 6.0 tests
for Sigma. Trying to finish bullet proofs,

145
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
verification tests, still a lot of things
ahead.

146
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The cool thing about this update, kushti,
I think I saw you notify some nodes, some

147
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
mining nodes is no update needed, of
course, but it is helpful to update to

148
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
support the new protocol on the network,
which is neat. Classic Ergo, where we have

149
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
serious amazing backwards compatibility
with older nodes.

150
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Basis ChainCash made raw demo, basis
tracker server demo, improving it. He's

151
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
discussing contract and possible
extensions for it. And USC Stablecoin,

152
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
still planning deployment, will start
issuing first needed tokens this week.

153
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
We've got Rosen Bridge. They've created a
root ESLint configuration for the app to

154
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
ensure consistent coding standards. The
app, they've put that configuration for

155
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
the app to ensure consistent coding, same
thing. They've improved the UI kit and for

156
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
the watch app, they had to put the ESLint
in as well.

157
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So, Rosen Bridge, we've, as you saw,
besides just the Cardano, they have other

158
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
runes, of course. We're not just focusing
on that aspect of it, but full rune

159
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
integration to Rosen, which is going to be
very interesting to bring runes back and

160
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
forth, not just mimicking tokens when they
go over to Bitcoin, but bringing them on

161
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
to other chains and actually having a
marketplace and liquidity and those kind

162
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
of things. It's going to be very
interesting to see those break out.

163
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Chris, our trusty friend Chris, has added
Javanese support and Malaysian support to

164
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
the Nautilus wallet. It's always great to
have those in many languages for the

165
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
global thing that Ergo is.

166
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Joe Samai is making Game of Prompts,
Judge system done, he's been seeing some

167
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
issues if the judges have a lot of
opinions, so he's updating the rep system

168
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
again. The current implementation asks for
20 to 50 participants, which is great, but

169
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
should be able to be unlimited, so they're
going to try to improve this.

170
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
We've got IOSPOR with Netcoats Engine.
They're working on async stream parsing.

171
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
This is for storing bundled sensitive
information like transaction history.

172
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Let's see. Here's an explanation. The way
it works is that you request a file from

173
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
the factory with a wallet ID as the
initial string. The factory then makes

174
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
sure it looks in the bucket that is
associated with a calling application, for

175
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
example, the wallet application, and then
all the wallet addresses above the wallet

176
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
application, and that wallet ID would
share the same root.

177
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh, very, very neat. So if you want to
delete the root wallet and the child

178
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
wallets, it could also be deleted. You
know, this is neat. So we talked about,

179
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
you know, a year or so ago, I talked with
our identity advisor here at Cornell about

180
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
this kind of, I call them vampire strings,
all right?

181
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So the idea is if we're providing
identity for people, right? And somebody

182
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
up the chain is a bad actor. How can you
guarantee that the identities provided by

183
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
that actor, bad actor, are good, right? So
you cannot trust the identity bestowed

184
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
down lower in the chain of that bad actor.
So you have to seize those identities,

185
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
right? In current AD structure, that's
difficult to do, right? Because there's

186
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
one identity for private provider, it's
federated, right?

187
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But in this vampire logic, right? If you
kill the head vampire, everything after

188
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
the vampire should vanish. So I think
that's a way that crypto can really help

189
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
out with identity, right? So if multiple
actors are deploying identity and granting

190
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
access, you find a bad actor, boom, you
blow it up everything underneath is on

191
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
hold until it's rebuilt, right? So really
neat concept for that. Let's see. And

192
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
that's it for dev updates. Very cool. Very
cool.

193
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So we got a quick question in chat. Let's
jump right on to that. T-Rog says, is

194
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
there any concern for similar delistings
for other exchanges, or has HTX been an

195
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
outlier for demanding this marketing fee,
marketing fee, $1 million.

196
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
In my mind, that never crossed my mind. I
think HTX is probably, from what I've

197
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
heard from the backroom chats, from people
dealing with HTX, is over the past month,

198
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
they've started really twisting the knife.
They've set these unfair changes in

199
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
liquidity and volume, and pushed them on
people without notifying them, and then

200
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
threatened delisting.

201
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And I honestly think it's too, yeah. Chat
in the comments is because Justin Sun is

202
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
cash poor. It does almost seem like
there's a directive from the top that

203
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
says, we need to make money fast. Let's
make it quick. So I think that's what HTX

204
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
is doing, and they're only going to burn
themselves and hurt themselves.

205
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So no, I don't think there's a concern
for smaller delistings for that kind of

206
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
thing. HTX seems to not care at all. Even
our contact in the chat just has stopped

207
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
replying at HTX. They're brazen. They know
what they're doing, and they're just

208
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
hoping that you guys forget about it. And
that's it. And they'll continue to do

209
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
that. That's typically what they do. So
the idea is don't forget about it. We'll

210
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
keep the repository up. And we'll make
them remember every single time, just like

211
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Pepperidge Farm, right? So no trolling.

212
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yeah, I will start to reach journalists
today. We need to get maximum exposure,

213
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:49,000
right? They're doing our own business. I
still think it's not extortion, like push

214
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:57,000
for bribery, right? It's not about
liquidity or volume, so based on who's got

215
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:05,000
the list, it's Ergo, Komodo and Firo. Firo
was totally fine and yeah so it's not

216
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:13,000
about liquidity or volume so it's
something different but yeah I don't know

217
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:21,000
principle but yeah well let journalists
maybe do their business now right and we

218
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:29,000
need to get exposure we need to get
interest rates, traffic and so on. This is

219
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:37,000
the best thing we can do at the moment.

220
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah, about liquidity exchanges. So I had
a talk and also discovered recently that,

221
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
well, for some exchanges, we already can
get some big centralized exchanges, for

222
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:05,000
example, Bit.Get. We can get exposure
basically for free just by providing

223
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:13,000
liquidity whether on Ethereum LP or
Binance Smart Chain, right?

224
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So then I think Binance will catch up,
right? So just there is need to afford to

225
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,000
provide liquidity on BSC pool, right and
at some point they will catch up and the

226
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
coinbase already showing Base LP some
centralized exchange interface, right? So

227
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,000
then base will be supported by Rosen soon,
but yeah, well, there is no need to wait

228
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:50,000
for anything right now.

229
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So let's consider whether to feel pool on
Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, so I can

230
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:09,000
put a little bit as well, right? And with
that, so with some funds in the pool, so

231
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:18,000
AI, the AI filter, you know, so they using
some AI filter to filter out some I don't

232
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:27,000
know, fake LPs and all that stuff, right?

233
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So yeah, it will be shown in the
centralized exchange interface and yeah,

234
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,000
maybe it gets much bigger than HTX like 10
times now because HTX is in decline, right

235
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:52,000
since 2022 and yeah BitGet is on the rise
and yeah especially for last one year and

236
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,000
a half so it's probably number three now
globally so after Binance and Bybit BitGet

237
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:08,000
is number three yeah I'm not sure about
the US but yeah well globally it's well

238
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:16,000
recognized now and we can get there
without any well listing fees right just

239
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:24,000
via Binance for example Binance Smart
Chain or Ethereum so yeah well we need to

240
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:32,000
decide something and put it into just
then, yeah, the same probably will work

241
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:40,000
for Binance at some point.

242
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So all the centralized exchanges are now
going to syndicate centralized exchange

243
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and decentralized exchanges to community
rights under the same interface. So BitGet

244
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,000
and Coinbase already done with that, and
yeah, I think others Bybit and Binance,

245
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:12,000
who else, OKX will catch up, right?

246
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So yeah, that's the way we can get
everywhere for free basically, right? In

247
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:33,000
form of rep tests, but then in case of
some active trading we can get on a

248
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:42,000
centralized exchange, right? So we can get
native integration as well.

249
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:52,000
All right, so yeah, let's discuss that
after the call maybe in Ergo trading, but

250
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:00,000
yeah, I had a talk with BitGet lady and
yesterday basically and yeah it seems it's

251
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:08,000
the best way to move forward right so we
need to choose some pool filled with

252
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:16,000
liquidity so I can put some. We can ask
some known whales and so on, right?

253
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And once we got through AI filters and
once we get some traction interests,

254
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:35,000
right? So we can get native integration as
well, right? But yeah, well, wrapped

255
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:43,000
version would be good. And yeah, the same
talk with Kraken, right? So it was about

256
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:51,000
listing wrapped token, but Kraken is still
using some own centralized solution,

257
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:59,000
right? So they're not automatically
pulling all the tokens from decentralized

258
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:07,000
exchanges like BitGets and Coinbase are
already doing.

259
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You know, correct. Correct. And Kraken
also has, you know, we know a brief

260
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
outline of what Kraken wants from us. So
we just have to hit that. That's all, I

261
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
think, and then re-approach them. I think
we've announced that several times. So

262
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Kraken is in a black box at least that
they would like to see holders in

263
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
liquidity on the token they want to list.

264
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I think ERG itself is probably a bit away
from that. But as you guys may know that

265
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
ERG on another chain with Rosen is, yeah,
Grayman bought us Rosen-ERG, he says in

266
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
chat, is a better possibility in the
immediate. So yeah, Kraken would be

267
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
amazing for ERG, I think.

268
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You know, there wasn't too much traction
on the votes up at for Rosen Bridge. I

269
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
think that's an issue with, I think every
chain has that issue, right? You have a

270
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
lot of participants that are passive
bystanders, right? Passive investors, we

271
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
call them. So that's something that
really, really needs to change for these

272
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
kinds of things to succeed.

273
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So if you guys are just tuning in, you're
unaware of that vote, go to Paideia and

274
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
look up the Rosen GARDs and you'll see a
vote to spread Rosen-ERG liquidity over

275
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Ergo, over Cardano, so that we can reach
their requirement for Kraken listing on

276
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Rosen-ERG.

277
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Yeah, because holding Rosen ERG, right?
If you're just holding, you know,

278
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
theoretically there's not much difference
of holding Rosen ERG or holding ERG. If

279
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
you actually want to utilize the ecosystem
and participate, you know, that's when you

280
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
hold ERG and use it actually. But for
silent partners, as Grayman says, that

281
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
should be an entry point at Kraken that's
perfectly suitable.

282
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
One thing I forgot to mention is I saw
heroes joined us from Twitter, but hero is

283
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
the dev on Cyberverse an update last week
that we missed because we were all

284
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
chatting too long about drama. So let me
just hit this for those of you who don't

285
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
know Cyberverse.

286
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Down for the month. They're doing a
massive upgrade with P2P combat, that kind

287
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
of stuff. So it's really, really exciting
when this comes back. They've worked on

288
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
the stat system back in in combat testing.
They've synced stats with the server.

289
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Example 50, EGI boost speed instantly. Oh,
that's awesome. Combat testing, fighting

290
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
high level enemies now clearly shows stat
differences. Stronger enemies equals

291
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
harder fights. Core system, they've
leveled up resets, HP and gives plus one

292
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
plus one skill point, stats window, spend
points, build your citizen, nice.

293
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Inventory, equip, quick use, manage items
and skills window, learn from books, level

294
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
skills and points.

295
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I think the treat that we have in Ergo
here is that... Well, maybe, I don't know

296
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
if it happens in other ecosystems, but you
can get close to these projects, right? We

297
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
can get in the dev update, we can see
these projects go, we can talk to Pixel,

298
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Mr. Pixel, we can talk to Hero, and you
get to, it's almost like a child, right?

299
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
You can see this infant from what
Cyberverse started on back in the day when

300
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
it was just Ergo integration, and you see
it grow into something like this, and

301
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
it's, it's interesting to look back and
remember what it was like playing this

302
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
game back in the day and where it's come
and where it's going. And so it's amazing

303
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
to be part of that and see those kind of
things grow.

304
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Okay, where are we next? Let's see, do we
have any questions in chat? There was chat

305
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
in the chat about a ERG who's right below
us in the zoom was interested in what's it

306
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
called? Working on some sort of academy
buildup again. We used to have something

307
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
called DECO, which was... Do we remember
what that stood for? Decentralized college

308
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
or something like that? Right? Was that
it, kushti? Grayman? Anybody remember?

309
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Deco-decentralized coordination.

310
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Coordination, okay. All right, thank you.
So that was fantastic. There's a lot of

311
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
videos there on that, kind of like basic
beginner ERG devs and that kind of thing.

312
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So yeah. It would be very awesome to get
that started again. There's a lot of

313
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
videos, and happy to help with the AI
method that I said before about

314
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
integrating those videos as well. So
whenever you're bringing up ERG, we can

315
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
hit it with all the past searchable and
linkable bookmarks in the AI model. So

316
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
students can hit the ground running with
that. So yeah, that's going to be amazing.

317
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
That is.

318
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What else? Anybody got anything else?
I've been talking a lot. So kushti,

319
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Grayman?

320
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Yeah, a lot of things going on. So, yeah,
well, there are some guys looking for

321
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:21,000
developers. So we need for more developers
guys. So if you know some, please bring.

322
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So, well, I brought a few in recent months
but there is need for more all the time so

323
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:37,000
if anyone is willing to promote Ergo
around development circles so yeah let's

324
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:45,000
consider some campaign I would be happy to
participate also and yeah so I think,

325
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:53,000
well, that there is need to promote Ergo
differently, right?

326
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So not as crypto, or whatever it's called
these days, crypto. These days it's quite

327
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,000
confusing to me, right, but yes, platform,
foundation, global, neutral, settlement

328
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:16,000
layer for building digital economies,
rights for humans, human communities,

329
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,000
developing communities, as well as AI
agents, right, and incentivizing

330
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,000
peer-to-peer networks.

331
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So yeah, well, a lot of use cases which
are handled by others in quite cozy ways.

332
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I think amongst the economist community,
most people that are not already involved

333
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
in crypto are somewhat disinterested or
maybe standoffish towards crypto in

334
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
general just because it's the way it's
been presented, you know, with the idea

335
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
that Bitcoin is going to replace the
dollar and hyper Bitcoin ization and all

336
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
this other shit. It just sounds cartoonish
to them.

337
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I mean, economists don't have a very firm
a soapbox to stand on when it comes to

338
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,000
being credible academics. They wouldn't
want to have anybody challenge that in the

339
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
press, but the truth is most economists at
the top of the food chain don't really

340
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,000
think of their field as being entirely
pure and hasn't been for a long time since

341
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:50,000
computers came around and made it possible
for the application of statistical methods

342
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,000
instead of actual thinking.

343
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
But now we have cryptocurrency, which
makes it so that instead of just having

344
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
statistical methods, you actually would
have a way to track the money as it's

345
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
being spent. And if they really want to
turn economics into a science and they

346
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
should embrace it, but there's a long road
between here and there. And most of the

347
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
people that are in that field are going to
visualize using some computer. So they

348
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
think world computer like Ethereum. So
they're all trapped in bullshit land over

349
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
there.

350
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
But really what it's about is redefining
money and then building that from the

351
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
ground up. And I don't see any project
that's doing a better job of that in

352
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
general than Ergo. I mean, in some
specific ways, like for example, Casper is

353
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
just sort of hyper focused on speed. But
until they win the race and get global

354
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
adoption, that's a whole lot of speed
going nowhere. There's barely any

355
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
transactions.

356
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Whereas in Ergo, we have a much more
broadly focused concept of of what money

357
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
is and how it can be exploited using a
deterministic approach rather than this

358
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
kind of open-ended world computer approach
of the Ethereum world. Economists

359
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
eventually will understand that and
embrace it, but it's going to take a long

360
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
time for that to become apparent and a
whole lot of soldiering on our part before

361
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
they'll take any real interest.

362
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So you just have to keep chipping away.
There are a few people like Rubini or, you

363
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
know, Steve Keene is the one that I keep
trying to plant seeds in his mind because

364
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
in my opinion, he's the guy who has sort
of the best understanding of how the

365
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
current system works and how we should go
forward.

366
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
But he's also somebody who earlier in his
career, was academically interested in

367
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
cryptocurrency and posited several
interesting ideas that, at this point, he

368
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
would probably look back and say we're
young and naive on his part. Instead of

369
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
having a carbon tax, having a separate
currency for purchasing gasoline or other

370
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
rationed products, which would then trade
on its own market, and it would give you a

371
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
way to create an economy that would reduce
the consumption of certain commodities

372
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
that were used like that.

373
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
This is something that he wrote about 15
years ago, maybe 12 years ago, and you

374
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
could actually contemplate making currency
systems for nations based on Ergo. That's

375
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
why it fascinates me, but there's very few
people that are in that academic community

376
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
that are just going to immediately leap to
that because it's so far outside of their

377
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
realm of thinking, and because most of the
people that are coming from the crypto

378
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
world are yelling at them that inflation
is stupid and why wouldn't you have a

379
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
fixed number of atoms of gold as the basis
for your currency and all this other

380
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
stuff, and they just laugh and walk away.

381
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But with something like ChainCash and
derivatives that can be built on top of

382
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
it, that's a whole new ballgame. And
eventually, they're going to have to get

383
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
on the field because we're going to make
them. Oh, and I had a question about

384
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
ChainCash for kushti in the chat.

385
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
The question was, can ChainCash protocol
be instantiated in a limited form where

386
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
only a certain type and collateralization
of notes can be issued on an accepted

387
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
standard. Instead of having a more
generalized free banking type system, can

388
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,000
you implement it in a way that it would
only work with certain types of

389
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
collateralization ratios and
denominations?

390
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Oh, so that's left to the party which is
accepting, right, so you can accept only

391
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,000
ChainCash notes which are backed by
particular assets, right, and also sets on

392
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:17,000
collateralization level. So that's, I
think, the whole point, right, so every

393
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,000
party is having individual risk profile
and then yeah well it's not enforced

394
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,000
around the system and then yeah that the
system is not hopefully failing fully,

395
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:38,000
right, like in 2008, the whole financial
system with pretty much the same

396
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:45,000
parameters everywhere failed, right?

397
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So some circles could fail, right, in
times of crisis, but yeah, well, more

398
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
conservative actors would stay at the same
time.

399
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I'm specifically thinking about this idea
of this silver sense, this currency based

400
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
on and tied to the existing United States
constitutional silver currency that's all

401
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
around this country and having it so that
the ChainCash implementation of the

402
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
on-chain version of that would only be
acceptable from vendor to vendor and

403
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
customer to vendor and customer to
customer even. If it followed a certain

404
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
protocol, so you couldn't just start
issuing things that that people, I guess

405
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
that you already answered the question.
You have to create an interface that makes

406
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
it so that the customer understands that
they're getting silver sets. You have to

407
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
have a specific token ID for the silver
sets.

408
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:06,000
In this particular case, if you want to
build some monetary circuit rights within

409
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,000
the whole so you can just make some
default config right for ChainCash servers

410
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,000
and spread right around that silver circle
and that's a default config would set

411
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,000
right particular token ID and
collateralization level maybe, then yeah,

412
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:34,000
it's possible to change collateralization
level individually also, but probably most

413
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,000
of users would just use default value as
usually happen.

414
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Yeah, I mean, ultimately there would be a
for-profit part of it. There were rollout

415
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
apps on iOS and on Android, because
there's no peer-to-peer on-chain activity

416
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
without mobile phones. Let's be real.
Especially if you're trying to go for some

417
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
sort of a LETS, a local exchange trading
system, you need to have people be able to

418
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
just pull out their phones and get a
transaction done.

419
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
So, and that's not going to happen
without some company structure and

420
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
whatnot. So there'd have to be sort of, I
don't know, sorry, I'm thinking out loud

421
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
about this whole thing. I'm trying to
write it up.

422
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yeah, that's much needed. Well, for now,
the idea is to get some working demo as

423
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:40,000
quickly as possible and then maybe try to
use it over some, I don't know, like

424
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:48,000
fairs. How is it so cold? Like for free
trading events.

425
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah, like a festival, I understand. You
have a flea market, swap meet, that type

426
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
of thing.

427
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Yeah, so try to do some flea markets kind
of events, right?

428
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
The other thing, while I have you on the
subject, just if you could quickly

429
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
comment, it seems to me when you were
initially proposing this idea that there

430
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
would be a reputation system involved for
people that are writing these notes? And I

431
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
don't know, is that true and has progress
been made in other projects like Joe

432
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Sammy's work on reputation system that
could be applied there?

433
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Because it strikes me that in the way I
envision it, you'll have these vendors who

434
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
are accepting silver in payment, and then
they can also accept this on chain

435
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
version. And so these vendors effectively
act as a distributed bank because they are

436
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
the ones with the pools of silver change
and they're safe and then taking it home

437
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and eventually turning it into dollars or
ERG or whatever they want.

438
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
But they are the ones who are essentially
holding the larger pools of capital. And

439
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
so it's a distributed form of banking,
sort of old school way, except with

440
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
standardized notes. And they're
standardized based on these physical

441
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
tokens that already exist and already
widespread. So the question is, if you

442
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
have only partially collateralized notes,
and it comes to a situation where somebody

443
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
decides to skip town and head to Mexico
with their US coins and melt them down,

444
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
and the people who are holding their notes
are left holding the bag, and so they want

445
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
to redeem them.

446
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And they get part of their
collateralization back, presumably, but

447
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
they're still out some and they're pissed.
So how do we make it so that guy can never

448
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
come back? I guess that's impossible
because they're going to be anonymous. I

449
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
don't know. Reputation system seems
important for this because if you're going

450
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
to have a bunch of distributed competing
vendors and banks that are not just

451
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
selling banking services, but are also
restaurants or farmers or, you know,

452
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
barbers or whatever. They're all going to
have multiple incentives and whatnot. You

453
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
need to have a way to keep track of how
well they handle the banking part. Do they

454
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
redeem their notes when asked for coinage?

455
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Right, so then, yeah, I think it's the
next step, right, so you can build

456
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,000
reputation only based on some trading
history. So then, yeah, so the idea is to

457
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,000
launch something, right, and then see how
to build some, yeah, kind of reputation

458
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,000
system, which is basically some summary,
right, of transactions history. Right.

459
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
That's all what we have here without, I
don't know, like control from state, you

460
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,000
know, like standards.

461
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I think there needs to be a way to
challenge their reputation and a way for

462
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
them to defend it and for those actions to
be taken on chain with deadlines and

463
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
whatnot in order to prevent it from being
spammed.

464
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yeah, so there could be some agents,
maybe, which are incentivized to do such

465
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
probing, right? That's quite interesting.
So, yeah, well, let's think on this

466
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
shortly, hopefully.

467
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I'm going to go and research what Joe
Sammy's been up to because I haven't

468
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
really paid him.

469
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Joe Sammy did some reputation system for
payments for his peer-to-peer network

470
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Celaut. But actually, I think it's quite,
I don't know, like parallel effort, right?

471
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So instead of using some reputation system
to provide credit, you can just use this

472
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:01,000
ChainCash, right? To provide credit. So
it's also kind of reputation system

473
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:08,000
process. But yeah, need to take a look,
maybe some combinations possible. You need

474
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:15,000
to take with just me also about that.

475
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:26,000
He is quite active and around and yeah
well actually we discussed to bring yeah

476
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:36,000
those basis payments into basis this kind
of off-chain cash in to Celaut particular

477
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:46,000
network. Because yeah, I think it's quite
interesting. So currently, there are a lot

478
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:56,000
of so-called DeFi projects, right, with
total market cap of 20 to 25 billion USD

479
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:06,000
and most of them do have some broken
economies, well, releasing tokens in a way

480
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:16,000
that they are just going down because of
our supply.

481
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:23,000
So the idea is that now we can tie supply
with demand by using just some off-chain

482
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:30,000
cash found by Ergo Reserve. So there is no
need for additional tokens, just Ergo and

483
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Ergo tokens would be enough.

484
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:49,000
So, let's, let's, continue discussion.
Yeah.

485
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Just a couple of questions, kushti. So,
in regards to ChainCash, would it have a

486
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
separate, it would be a separate project
with its own marketing budget and

487
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
marketing team? Would you be focusing on
this or?

488
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Yeah, so there will be no token, right,
for sure, because I don't like to issue

489
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,000
tokens at all when they are not needed.
But yeah, there is need to do some

490
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,000
marketing, right?

491
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Is it reasonable to say that if Ergo is a
platform, that ChainCash is a protocol?

492
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
And that it is a protocol that will be
used by people to create applications and

493
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
that those are what need the marketing.

494
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Ergo is a kind of reserve asset and smart
reserve asset, so it's allowing for

495
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,000
different protocols to be built on top of.
And then we have ChainCash as a monetary

496
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:56,000
expansion tool, because for being useful
for real economies, you need some kind of

497
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:03,000
monetary expansion.

498
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And yeah that's quite different as you
say it's right from all the crypto and I

499
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:21,000
think that's quite a fork of Bitcoin
community idea space let's say of 2010

500
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:30,000
basically right 2011. So initially, they
had a lot of discussions, right? How can

501
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:39,000
you build electronic cash, right? When
emission is strictly set into the

502
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:48,000
protocol. And yeah that they had some
discussions but later somehow the focus

503
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:57,000
shifted to some secondary issues such as
TPS right whatever now that they are

504
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:06,000
having hot debates our there are some
parameters in the protocol clients, but

505
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:15,000
the original talk is forgotten and revived
here.

506
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And those talks, I believe, are the most
important, right? So how to use

507
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:38,000
high-quality base assets, Ergo-right
proof-of-work assets to build better

508
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:46,000
money, right, for digital and real-world
economies.

509
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,000
So there was one other question that was
mentioned on the YouTube stream from EAOK

510
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
asking any thoughts on the infinite pitch
deck that he shared or they shared in the

511
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Dev Telegram?

512
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I need to check.

513
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Sounds like we need to follow up on the
Dev Telegram.

514
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Yeah, so actually, yesterday I was
occupied with quite a lot of talks with

515
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:31,000
BitGet lady and we had a nice talk with
Bruno and so on, but yeah, from Yehokai.

516
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Yeah, it's from yesterday. It was a good
time of mine. So yeah, I was occupied with

517
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:49,000
a lot of talks yesterday. So, we'll
provide some feedback today after coding

518
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:58,000
session. Right. We will do the, do you
guys, anyone, read it?

519
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I did not.

520
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Do we have any other questions? We're
coming up on the hour here. There was one

521
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,000
other question I had actually earlier in
chat, which was about the upcoming meeting

522
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,000
in Colorado Springs, which I guess there
might be somebody who's listening to this

523
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:29,000
that could still get tickets or figure out
a way to drive there in time.

524
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,000
You're welcome to come. If you can get
there, then there's going to be a lot of

525
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
fun. One question that I had earlier, but
I see that HQ has gone, was what

526
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,000
facilities were doing to make it so that
that is going to be broadcast to the

527
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,000
greater internet. But we'll figure that
out. Tickets are not necessary. You're

528
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
just welcome to come. We're going to open
it up to the general public. We're going

529
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,000
to try and put some flyers up in the local
universities. Anybody who's interested and

530
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
wants to come and listen and talk is
welcome to come. It's permissionless, no

531
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
tickets. It's Ergo.

532
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So okay, just making sure you set
tickets. You made me a little nervous. I

533
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
was like, I thought I signed.

534
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I mean, plane tickets. There's definitely
one form of permission, which is just

535
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
geographical permission. Yeah, I was
thinking about what you say. I've got, I

536
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,000
got room for somebody to sleep on a couch
and an Airbnb if somebody needs to crash.

537
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
But there's hotels and everything around.

538
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
We're not recording them. Are we?

539
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I think we are. I think we're live. We
should talk about it on the six chat.

540
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Are there any other questions for this
week's AMA or should we wrap it up? Sounds

541
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,000
like we should probably wrap it up. It was
great talking to y'all in another week.

542
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,000
We'll do it again.

543
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
All right. Yeah. Good chat. And, so, we
have, Colorado events, in two weeks.

544
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Right. So quite soon.

545
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Yeah. Coming up quick. It's going to be
fun. I'm going to get to meet Ed. Bye.

546
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Nice. Nice. Before you drop off, Grayman.
I had a question for you before you drop

547
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
off.

548
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Okay. Sure. Hit me.

549
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Oh no, you guys can end the chat. I want
to ask.

550
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Oh, gotcha. I think Andy is currently
the, the owner, so I can't control it,

551
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
but, it's probably going to. Thanks guys.
We got to roll it out with the music.

552
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Goodbye everyone. We'll see you next time.
