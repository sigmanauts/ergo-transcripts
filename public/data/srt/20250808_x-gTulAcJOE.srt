1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I think the third consecutive Community
AMA, starting off with a few people today.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hopefully we get more people to join in
throughout the hour.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We've got with us Joseph Armeanio, who is
enjoying his fake background at Rare Evil

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Vegas.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Looks good there, Joe.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We've got kushti, who is coming live from
his kitchen, and we've got HQ.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Who knows where HQ is?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't know where HQ is.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Probably in a closet somewhere hiding
from his sleeping bride, I'm assuming.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How you doing, HQ?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
How you doing, guys?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah, my work space.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So yeah, a lot of traffic in August,
right?

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Early August.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So yeah, it seems like most people are on
vacations.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But yeah, we are here.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We're active.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So yeah, HQ, how are you doing?

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I thought I was living in all Ergonauts'
hearts.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But OK, I will just say that I live where
I live.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So yeah, good evening, everyone, and glad
to be here.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Great, good night.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
HQ, I heard you just came out with
something new.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You woke up and you decided to write
another thing.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What did you do, like a simple DAO or
something it's called?

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What did I do?

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So that's the question.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So I just finished paper wallet
creations, paper wallet top-ups, and aid

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
drops, and vanity address.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And on the other side, I did some
on-chain voting into the Alephium side.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So yeah, I think I've done multiple stuff
in the last three, yesterday.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, nice.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So your simple voting is fully on
Alephium.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yep.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's what they needed for that now.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, cool.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Do they care about governance?

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, I told them to use Paideia, but I
think it's not supported.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So no, I know.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It was a joke.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Awesome.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Fantastic.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What else is up guys?

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Before we dive into some topics that were
suggested, what else is new guys?

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Who wants to go next?

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What's new?

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So a lot of things.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We published something on the forum and
we currently have super active discussions

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
in the ChainCash group about the different
stuff which I love like peer-to-peer

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
currencies, ChainCash based monetary
systems and so on.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Then preparing nodes 6.1 release and here
after that we can start testing sub-blocks

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:05,000
supporting mining nodes in the public
testnet, I guess.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So, yeah, well, things are going quite
well and 6.1 will be released later today,

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
maybe tomorrow.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Moin is willing to do some additional
tests.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So, yeah, let's see how it's going.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Then, yeah well for our sub-blocks some
good progress but yeah the writing is at

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
the beginning yeah going quite slowly but
yeah maybe the weekend next week there

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
will be a speed up here but yeah well in
recent days mostly polished.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The implementation did commence and so
on.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We will start to use LLM again to do more
tests and so on.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, a lot of things.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, also published some forum posts on,
well, better money labs and so on.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And we'll publish more different things
in coming days.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What's your need look like for helping
with sub-blocks testing?

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Is it just going to roll out on the
current testnet when we update that?

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, so ideally we need miners, right?

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So we have currently a miner which is not
generating sub-blocks, right?

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So it would be good to test a hybrid
setting where there are different miners,

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
right?

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Because well, many deployment will look
like that.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So it's not mandatory protocol update,
right?

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's not a soft fork even.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No, it would be a soft fork at some point
because you need to...

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You actually need to take a closer look
to activation details.

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But yeah, for public testnet, we just
need for starters an additional miner.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So, well, we need to leave the current
miner intact, right, and add another one

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
with sub-blocks generation going on.

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And then yeah, check inject maybe also
some clients and then test how things are

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
going.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Then, yeah, based on that starts planning
mainnet activation, but yeah, we also need

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
writing, right, and well, for some
security audit.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So currently write some things in the
codes, marking some places for like close

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
security audits needed.

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Speaking of security audits, I heard that
you took a look over the SigmaLock

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
contracts.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
How did those look, kushti?

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah, so I sent some notes to Luca.

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But yeah, well, in general, it looks good
here.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah, you guys can go ahead, I believe,
with that.

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Fantastic.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Fantastic.

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, I think we're waiting on one of the
pieces in the front end or something like

95
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
that.

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So we should hopefully... As I said last
week, we'll test on testnet, I think, for

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
now.

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And then MGPi and I will move it over to
our own infrastructure, Sigmanauts, and

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
we'll open it up to the public.

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So, excited about that.

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That'll be fun.

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
All right, so what's the idea?

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Did you post another kushti token on Mew?

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Did you replenish that token or you
haven't posted it yet?

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Not yet.

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So yeah, I actually thought to check
some, well, Mew tutorial submissions today

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and send out Mew I received.

108
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And yeah, for the rest, I can just put
Mew along with ERG into a liquidity pool

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
probably.

110
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But yeah, well, we will do more token
sales.

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So yeah, it's actually quite, I think,
exciting to do more like community work

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
organized in such a form where you receive
something and then put it in the rewards

113
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:36,000
for other parties.

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So yeah actually I think it could be a
good time to start some raffle also for

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
like two to three months maybe for another
ergo devs fundraising ergo devs now

116
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
because we always spending on something
like we now need to pay for Keystone

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
integration, right?

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's close.

119
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Then, yeah, we paid for Sigma Rust 6.0
support and so on.

120
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah, so I don't know, maybe we can do
fundraising for sub-blocks, security

121
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
audit, or what else could be needed.

122
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's a merge-mined sidechains framework.

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So hopefully, there will be some more
serious funding for that.

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But yeah, we can start with a raffle.

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Or just for sub-blocks, maybe.

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's already quite good, right?

127
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Cool.

128
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What were you asking?

129
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You were asking what we're going to do
with SigmaLock?

130
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah, so from my observations, yeah, you
guys had like few different use cases in

131
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
mind, right?

132
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Right.

133
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The first most obvious one is a batching
of assets to somebody else based on a time

134
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
lock or a price, essentially.

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So a simple contract that allows you to
pass your tokens on to a child or a spouse

136
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
or something like that, depending on a
time that has passed or else a price.

137
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And the beautiful thing about these
contracts are that you know, because

138
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
somebody actually mentioned, I was talking
to somebody the other day who actually

139
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
sold life insurance in the past and
they're like, okay, what happens if the

140
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
person dies?

141
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I was like, well, you know, they still
have to wait for the price to appreciate

142
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
to the strike mark or the time to evolve
to the past to the expiry there.

143
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And I was like, but the contract is
flexible enough to where you could set up

144
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
for one year each time essentially.

145
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So you could continuously update it and
feed it into another contract every year

146
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
for that as well.

147
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And you could do it before.

148
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So let's say I have tokens and I've given
them away already.

149
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You wouldn't want to wait till after the
contract expires to do that because your

150
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
child could cash out your assets if that's
who you're giving them to.

151
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So you essentially check the box that
says, I, as the creator of that have power

152
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
to change the contract at any time.

153
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So once a year or once every 2 years,
whatever you think that span of time is,

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
you could just, you know, at day 363, you
could just push a new contract right out

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
for another year kind of thing.

156
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So there is that option.

157
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
With that, which is neat, it gives you
that flexibility.

158
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The other thought is, you know, the idea
was for vested tokens, essentially, if

159
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
you're working with a developer and they
want to know that they're definitely going

160
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
to get paid, but you don't want to give
them the tokens at the time.

161
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Let's say I'm starting a widget project
and I have a widget token and I want to

162
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
pay the developer in widget tokens, but
you know, there's a liquidity pool in the

163
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
communities, you know, using it and the
project is kind of going and I don't want

164
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
the developer that I've hired to just dump
on it, right?

165
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So I could essentially stage my payments
to that developer with tokens.

166
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I could make a pocket of six months, give
him the unlock token.

167
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I could make him a pocket of eight
months, give him the unlock token.

168
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Make a pocket of a year and give him the
unlock token.

169
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So then that developer could then sell
tokens throughout that time as the work is

170
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
done.

171
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So there are those two options right up
the back that I think you can use for.

172
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And then, of course, the diamond hand
option where you just put it in to hold

173
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
for yourself to protect you against
yourself, so you don't spend it yourself.

174
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Either way, or send your token to cold
wallet.

175
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Alright.

176
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So a couple options.

177
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah, that's interesting.

178
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So you can then use those tokens for
funding projects, right?

179
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So they can get vesting basically.

180
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Kind of like a ChainCash note almost, but
on chain, right?

181
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
A promissory note, I guess, or a
redemption note.

182
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But it's more like vesting, right?

183
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It could be based on time, but also on
price, right?

184
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So it's kind of like an option.

185
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
No, not really.

186
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And then, yeah, it's quite interesting,
right?

187
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So it could be used.

188
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So you can use vesting along with
price-based conditions, right?

189
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
To lock tokens, project tokens, for
example.

190
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But yeah, I mean, it's probably... needed
to cover all those use cases with a few

191
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
articles, right?

192
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Because it's quite vast functionality, I
believe.

193
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Great, great.

194
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What else is new?

195
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, so last night, nice and tired, I
pushed the Paideia DAO.

196
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The vote passed last week, and I was
given 50,000 Paideia in my wallet so that

197
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I could build the InfraDAO.

198
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So I built the InfraDAO.

199
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I have tokens.

200
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I minted 1,000 tokens a month ago or so.

201
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So those people who are interested in
initially joining the InfraDAO, please

202
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
reach out to me again, or I'll reach out
to you.

203
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I have my notes somewhere with four or
five people listed that would like to

204
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
join.

205
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So reach out again and we'll start that
DAO up.

206
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Once we have a handful of people in
there, we'll dump the rest of the tokens

207
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
into the DAO.

208
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
On top of that, I also uploaded and made
a repository on GitHub for the Explorer

209
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
versions that I'm using currently.

210
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's Dockerized.

211
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's based off this, I can't remember who
originally built it, but it's based off

212
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
essentially that with some tweaks.

213
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And that's what we're running here, so
there's a full list of instructions on

214
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
what you need, how to set up the, what to
set up beforehand, you need NGINX, you

215
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
need the full sync node, you need Git, and
then how to set it up and run it.

216
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
If you're going to be part of the
InfraDAO, there's actually nothing you

217
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
need to change.

218
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You simply just clone the repository,
download it, and run it, and then you join

219
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
the DAO and you get the SSL certs from
Cloudflare from us and you insert those

220
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
into your system.

221
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And at that point, we point the load
balances to you, do some testing and make

222
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
sure everything works.

223
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And then you're part of the load balance
for that.

224
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So, that's how we're starting off small
with the Explorer infrastructure.

225
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And we're going to move to hosting
things, hopefully, like ErgoExplorer, like

226
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
SigmaSpace, like ErgoDocs, eventually the
Ergo Platform website, as well as

227
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
SigmaSpace and Sigmaverse, all those kind
of things.

228
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And then beyond that, most likely we'll
move to something like anybody who touches

229
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Ergo from a maintenance side, right?

230
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Updating side can also be part of the DAO
and work on that kind of stuff.

231
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So, yeah, starting off small slowly
building.

232
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
We don't want anything to crash.

233
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So being conservative in our steps.

234
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
All right, all right.

235
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Who'd we lose?

236
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We lost Joe.

237
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Joe must have gotten a calling over at
Vegas.

238
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And yeah, at the time when I wanted to
ask about Rosen updates.

239
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
He can sense it coming.

240
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah, they made some more catalyst
proposals in particular about base.

241
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And yeah, there was a tweet from base
recently that they will allow any assets

242
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:42,000
on base to be tradable on the centralized
exchange Coinbase.

243
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's we can actually get on Coinbase,
right?

244
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So any assets tradable?

245
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

246
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Like any of 8 million assets they have on
base would be tradable on Coinbase.

247
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So we need to get a wrap token over there
kind of thing, or is it ERG on another

248
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
chain?

249
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Rosen ERG, yeah, and well, there is also
a need to find liquidity, right?

250
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Some liquidity providers, but then, yeah,
it would be quite good for liquidity

251
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
providers.

252
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So that means that's for trading, kushti.

253
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So that means we would still enter
through another token on Coinbase and then

254
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
directly swap on Coinbase and hold Rosen
ERG on Coinbase.

255
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah, but that's not different, for
example, from listing Cardano assets on

256
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Kraken, right?

257
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
No, right, correct, yeah.

258
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So it's basically the same, model
liquidity, right?

259
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So well, for base, they will be needed to
find liquidity, but for liquidity

260
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
providers, it should be quite attractive,
I believe, right?

261
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Because probably as an onramp option and
offramp also.

262
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah, it could be quite popular.

263
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So then, yeah, I mean, in a few months,
we can get another option for the US for

264
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:25,000
onramp and offramp, right, and to trade.

265
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So yeah, that would be great.

266
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Nautilus has been pushed to production.

267
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So if you guys opened up Nautilus in the
last day or so, I'm not sure when it

268
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
happened.

269
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You will notice that it has been updated
and there is a buy ERG button in it now

270
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
and the production version.

271
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So yeah, you click on it and it takes you
right to Banxa.

272
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't know.

273
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
How do you say that?

274
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Banxa where you can buy ERGs directly
with fiat in the USA.

275
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's almost like a Bankster, right?

276
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So that's great.

277
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's the first step in integration, I'd
say.

278
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Maybe at some point in the future, we'll
see it fully baked into Nautilus wallet to

279
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
make it even easier.

280
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And we all know that yeah, that seems to
be the thing of choice, right?

281
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
People don't like leaving their walled
gardens in those instances.

282
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So yeah, super excited to see that.

283
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I am yet to test out that on-ramp.

284
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Has anybody here tested out Banxa?

285
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Cool.

286
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's blocked in the UK, unfortunately.

287
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I think it's blocked for you as well.

288
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I think it's blocked in New York.

289
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's one of the states that's not
supported.

290
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Oh, that's right.

291
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I can't test it.

292
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I should be able to test it from South
America, my account in South America.

293
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So we'll see.

294
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I can try that.

295
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Good point.

296
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
New York.

297
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Damn it.

298
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's New York and California, is it?

299
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What are the two states?

300
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's like two states.

301
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yes, a couple.

302
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's a couple of weird ones like Alabama
or something in New York.

303
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah, I need to go look again, but yeah,
it's a few weird ones.

304
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Maybe Illinois?

305
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Illinois, okay.

306
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Okay, interesting.

307
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And yeah, some questions.

308
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So yeah, I think it's KYC.

309
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah, it's KYC.

310
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But can we get non-KYC options for the
US?

311
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Probably not at all, right?

312
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I mean, these days it's not quite
possible.

313
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah, not legit ones.

314
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So and then yeah there is also question
when a new exchange so yeah I don't know

315
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I've received a few listing offers which
are free, but you have to pay for

316
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,000
marketing campaign.

317
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:22,000
There are some MM requirements, but not
strict.

318
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Yeah, the question are those options
needed, right?

319
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Considering that they're not really free
and marketing campaigns probably won't

320
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
work.

321
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
kushti, maybe we should just ask the
Cardano treasury for listing fees to pay

322
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
those.

323
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yeah, that's actually quite fine.

324
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But for this SNEK, right?

325
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah, I couldn't believe that.

326
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's fine.

327
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Drama.

328
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's just funny to see that argument
online.

329
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's funny that people are masquerading
the potential to pump something by listing

330
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
it with the idea that it's going to be
better for the economy.

331
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I don't know.

332
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's funny arguments, seeing these crazy
hollow arguments that are very transparent

333
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
to use community treasury money to list an
individual project.

334
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Absolutely nuts.

335
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Right.

336
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But yeah, I mean, so for Cardano
community, I believe it would be better to

337
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
support base proposal from Rosen, right,
and then yet trade SNEK on base, right, a

338
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Coinbase centralized exchange, as well as
other Cardano assets than Ergo, then what

339
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
else?

340
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Handshake probably, right?

341
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And other blockchains which are joining
Rosen.

342
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The beauty about Rosen on base is that
you're essentially rug-proof, right?

343
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Once Rosen is on base or once Rosen can
connect certain chains that are on base,

344
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
if something's rugged or pulled from base,
then just make another pair somewhere with

345
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
some other token that's already on base
that Rosen can reach, right?

346
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So there's a level of protection you get
when you're using Rosen and ability to

347
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
traverse to another backdoor if one door
is shut on you.

348
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Unlike when exchanges write you and say,
oh, I'm sorry, your fake washing and fake

349
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
volume is not up par with what we need you
to stay listed on this exchange.

350
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
That million dollars you paid us for your
marketing fee?

351
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
No, that's gone.

352
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You're off.

353
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Spicy today, kushti, sorry.

354
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
That's insane, but we need more
centralized exchanges maybe, but the

355
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
question is which ones, right?

356
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So those exchanges which can list for
some marketing campaign amounts, let's

357
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:21,000
say, just they're like CoinDCX, which I
can give a pair with the Indian Rupiah

358
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:31,000
then, what else?

359
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So there are some other exchanges, like a
few ones.

360
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,000
But yeah, the question is, will they
provide any value?

361
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's not clear.

362
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And from exchanges which can provide
value, I think it would be good to get

363
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
maybe on some regional exchanges, right?

364
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Well, what happened?

365
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Is TradeOgre still down?

366
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Has that gone for good?

367
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Did you hear any news on that?

368
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Any additional news?

369
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I don't know so there are no any news and
yeah I mean people are saying that back in

370
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:17,000
2023 they went offline for 12 days in a
row but yeah I mean this time probably

371
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:26,000
people are nervous after ZGex right well
there are expectations of a new incident

372
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:35,000
let's say but yeah it's not quite clear
what's going on because yeah it's it's

373
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:44,000
fully anonymous exchange there are a lot
of questions but no one knows what's going

374
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:53,000
on there

375
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Yeah, but let's hope it will be up soon.

376
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
What was that, Mark?

377
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You're going to say something?

378
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I was just saying it's still there and I
just checked.

379
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yeah, I'm looking at connection time down
for Cloudflare.

380
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I think I've got 50 cents still there
from when I was trading USDT and ERG with.

381
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I think it was a bot that... Can't
remember who made it.

382
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Somebody in the Ergo mining made a nice
little trade bot that works with TradeOgre

383
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
that did pretty well, honestly.

384
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It was just keeping the spread.

385
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It was just trying to keep a spread there
between the two.

386
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So yeah.

387
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Mb says, from Kuwait, new, how can we
help?

388
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Welcome and be new.

389
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Fantastic.

390
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
There's a lot of things you can do here
in the ecosystem.

391
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
There's several DAOs to join.

392
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
There's a Sigmanauts, which is a
community DAO, which essentially tries to

393
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
oversee and help and bolster anything
that's related to Ergo from a community

394
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
standpoint.

395
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
They've branched off and created the Ergo
SIG mining DAO, which is based on a mining

396
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
pool, one of the first to collect storage
rent.

397
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
So there's that to join if you have a GPU
and you want to point that, even if you

398
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
don't want to mine, it's a fun group to
join.

399
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
We just launched, as I said, the Ergo
InfraDAO, which is working on hosting

400
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
infrastructure based on the community
input, as opposed to essentially funded

401
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
model.

402
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
This would be a more of a community
funded model to host all the Ergo

403
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
infrastructure.

404
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But yeah, hop in there, roll up your
sleeves.

405
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
If you do any program, the core devs have
a lot of, the EF has a lot of bounties out

406
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
there that are ripe for the picking that
you can make some money off of and Other

407
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
than that the easiest way to help out Ergo
is to spread the word whether it be in

408
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
telegram Facebook Instagram Twitter or
x.com Or anything like that.

409
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
That's the easiest way to way to give it
a go and of course if you have any

410
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
questions about how it works or why Ergo
or anything like that and hop in chat and

411
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
somebody will be bound to correct you or
encourage you or give you the details on

412
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
why they think Ergo is important in this
place, this time, moment in time.

413
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Yeah.

414
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah, and actually we have some new
generation coming, right?

415
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So recently a lot of new faces in the
chats, actually, as well as our Twitter.

416
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So probably there is need to repost
tutorials from 2021, 2022.

417
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
on how to use applications, what
applications are available, along with new

418
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
tutorials for Mew and so on.

419
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So how to trade, what are security
assumptions, how it goes different in

420
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
regards with open source, know your
assumptions, minimizing trust, enabling

421
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
peer-to-peer interactions and so on.

422
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Did you get any of your submissions?

423
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
At least one, but yeah, I need to check
the chat because I've been busy with other

424
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
matters in recent days.

425
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
But yeah, there is at least one
submission from Michael, so yeah, we'll

426
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
check.

427
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Yeah, pay out reward.

428
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Later today, hopefully.

429
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Still a lot of things, other things, but
yeah, hope to find time for that.

430
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Then, yeah, well, We, I believe, made a
ton of materials, right, over the last few

431
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
years.

432
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Historically, we have so much.

433
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's insane how much materials we have,
kushti, absolutely crazy.

434
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Yeah, most of them are still relevant, so
here we can just repost them for

435
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
newcomers.

436
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I mean, you know, it could be a big
mistake to consider, you know, Ergo

437
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
community as something static, right?

438
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Like people who came when even, right?

439
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I mean, most of people high C rounds came
in 21, right?

440
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
22.

441
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But yeah, well, most of my conversations,
you know, happened around 2019-20, right?

442
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Because, yeah, after that, it got quite
hard to communicate with so many people,

443
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
to be honest.

444
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So, yeah, well, there is need to limit
communications channels.

445
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Mostly.

446
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
But yeah, well, it's not static, right?

447
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It's not formed in 21, right?

448
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Well, in static scene, so.

449
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Yeah, well, people are always coming and
some going, right?

450
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:56,000
But yeah, most of people around, well,
periodically appearing.

451
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,000
But yeah, new face always appearing, and
there is need to basically remind, right,

452
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
about what Ergo is, what tooling
available, what are basic principles.

453
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:19,000
manifestos and so on, so on, so on.

454
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Yeah, we actually need to prepare for
like new big wave of Ergonauts.

455
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I think it's time, right?

456
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Because, well, it's 2025 and yeah, well,
there is a new wave of interest, I

457
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:47,000
believe, in proof-of-work assets, right?

458
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's, well, uncontrollable major assets.

459
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Well, even legally, right?

460
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So in the US, there could be recognition
in the form of the Clarity Act.

461
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Maybe, you know, more.

462
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Yeah, well, it seems it's the time,
right, for major uncontrolled performance.

463
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh, a big notice here, kushti.

464
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Spectrum's winding down.

465
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Ah, okay.

466
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yep, it looks like this.

467
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
So for those of you that are new here,
Spectrum started out as ErgoDEX back in

468
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
the day.

469
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And then they moved to Spectrum Network,
they're branded and they pushed to Cardano

470
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
mainly, so they're very focused on
Cardano.

471
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
They still ran ErgoDEX for Ergo side, but
they've been off Ergo for quite a while,

472
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'd say.

473
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
But it's about Spectrum Network.

474
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yeah, so I think ErgoDEX will remain,
right?

475
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But yeah, I mean, it's not being
developed.

476
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Yeah, it hasn't been.

477
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Mew uses the ErgoDEX front-end
modification, or Crooks did, I think.

478
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't know if Mew uses specifically
that, but yeah, right?

479
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Mew uses it, HQ.

480
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah, I think we are, we're using the
front-end modified version, but we need to

481
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
check with the team about the backend, so
if it's going to run, it's still good,

482
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
because last time we tried to run it, it
told us that it was, like, thick to run

483
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
it.

484
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So I guess if they're going down, we
would just set everything with them and

485
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
get the backup.

486
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
The backend also, so far the backend is
working, so yeah.

487
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Do you run your own batcher bots because
you have Mew HQ?

488
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Yeah.

489
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
We have custom bots, which we have.

490
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Other community members were also running
those, so there's no issue with those

491
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
bots.

492
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Very cool.

493
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
But ErgoDEX, it seems untouched, right?

494
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So it's about Spectrum Network, which has
a white paper, basically.

495
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Who hosts?

496
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Yasha doesn't host.

497
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I mean, Ilya doesn't host ErgoDEX as well
on their infrastructure?

498
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Sorry.

499
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I thought that, posted ErgoDEX on their
infrastructure along with spectrum.

500
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
No, isn't that their infrastructure?

501
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Yeah.

502
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So it's, they front end, yeah, they're
hosting, but they're profiting from it,

503
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
right?

504
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
It's they're getting, that's true.

505
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
That is true.

506
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Yeah.

507
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
But contracts on chain and contracts,
it's the same, basically, decentralized

508
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
exchange with different frontends, right?

509
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
So Mew and ErgoDEX.

510
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But ErgoDEX seems to be intact and
Spectrum Network is a white paper they

511
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:17,000
published back in 21, right?

512
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:25,000
And yeah, well, not sure about
implementation.

513
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So initially, they they stated that there
are some issues in Plutus, right, and they

514
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:43,000
awaited for Plutus version 3.

515
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:51,000
But then, yeah, well, probably the whole
concept of layer 2, right, as mentioned in

516
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:58,000
the white paper, became irrelevant.

517
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So we have some layer 2s coming, right,
but of a different kind.

518
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Well, I think the good part about this is
they are paying back people if they're

519
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
still holding SPF, right?

520
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Because if you go down in the series
refreshment method, so people just need to

521
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
have their SPF in their wallets and they
will be paid back.

522
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Once we return the provider to all the
SPF folders, it's on chain reserves.

523
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
All right, yeah.

524
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
But yeah, well, those SPF tokens intended
to be utility tokens of the network,

525
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
right?

526
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Spectrum network.

527
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:59,000
But yeah, well, this network has white
paper.

528
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I haven't seen any.

529
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Oh, they had some vault contracts,
actually.

530
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Would be quite useful to reuse them
maybe.

531
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So it's it's left unnoticed, but yeah,
vault contract is actually quite cool.

532
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So it has just single public key, I
believe, on chain, right?

533
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So just like ordinary address.

534
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:45,000
the Ergo blockchain but actually
off-chain it's controlled by up to 1024

535
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,000
signers right and that they made some
prototype some demo of signing so yeah

536
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,000
could be reused I believe for some large
scale DAOs and so on right so in spectrum

537
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:06,000
network there was idea to have validators
controlled

538
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Spectrum network validators control
vaults.

539
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:29,000
But, yeah, it's open source, so, yeah,
well, it can be reused in other contexts.

540
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And, yeah, so for layer 2s, well, what we
have is kind of specific layer 2s, right?

541
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Like, Lithos coming and in the ChainCash
group, we are discussing like multiple

542
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:07,000
trackers based off-chain cache, like bit
torrent trackers kind of model, but for

543
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:22,000
tracking state of ChainCash systems.

544
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Any news on Silver Dexy?

545
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
But we don't have Joe.

546
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
He's coming back.

547
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
His phone, his battery died.

548
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
He's coming right now.

549
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Look at this.

550
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
All right.

551
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So Joe, you've got a question, Joe.

552
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
What did I miss?

553
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:49,000
You missed Silver, so the question is
when Silver Dexy?

554
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
That's a good question.

555
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
We do have the Oracle put together.

556
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I would say Dexy's been out for a bit, so
we should have some information in terms

557
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
of how it's operating.

558
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
So all the pieces are there to put it
together anyway.

559
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I don't think we've had a firm date
towards launching it.

560
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It's been interesting.

561
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I know that Gluon was working on trying
to fully verify their protocol.

562
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And then we have Dexy in parallel.

563
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:28,000
So that's a big choice that the Rosen
community can make, which protocol to plug

564
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:36,000
in that oracle to.

565
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Joe, you sharing a booth, Joe, with Zen
Gate this year?

566
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Or are you by your own booth?

567
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Or are you just going to float with the
t-shirts and just cannon them into people?

568
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
No, no.

569
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I'm going to be around Zen Gate.

570
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Very nice.

571
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Is CKB joining you guys as well this
year?

572
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah, I was actually talking with Jordan
yesterday.

573
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
about what they're working on over there
and, you know, potential collaborations.

574
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Watch out for Jordan and Dan.

575
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
They have sticky fingers when it comes to
t-shirts and merch, Joe.

576
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Oh, yeah.

577
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Oh, yeah.

578
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'll be ready.

579
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I'll be ready.

580
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
What were you saying?

581
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Sorry.

582
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Oh, no, I spent some time with them
yesterday.

583
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I had lunch, was talking about what
they're doing, working on in their

584
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
ecosystem, what we're working on,
potential for collaboration.

585
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Are you guys thinking of bridging to CKB
in the future?

586
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Yeah, I would love to.

587
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,000
It fits a lot of the parameters that I
find attractive with Rosen, where it's

588
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,000
proof of work chain, oftentimes
underappreciated, and I would say

589
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:02,000
undervalued relative to, I don't know,
sometimes a crypto space can be weird.

590
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
People will look you straight in the eye
and sell you a cartoon.

591
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
What can you do?

592
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Yep.

593
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Yep, what's new on the EF side, Mark?

594
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Any updates?

595
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yeah, we've got Allison's working with
Banxa to create a notification service, so

596
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
that will be a week or two, he said.

597
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
After that, we can get Banxa Withdrawals
live.

598
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
And finally, we've fully finished Horn
Loft Ramp.

599
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
So that'll be good.

600
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I've just been working on lots of
articles, so I've got my 10 articles in

601
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
the go.

602
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I'm just trying to flood them over the
next few weeks.

603
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I'm also going to update the roadmap on
the docs, because that's been updated to

604
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
2024.

605
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
So I need to update that, and it will be
in the pitch deck as well, because there's

606
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
a bunch of post-launch investors.

607
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So I figure it's worth it, I'll just spam
in the pitch tech out there, out to them,

608
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
try and get some more eyes on Ergo.

609
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Because it's an easy investment, easy
win, if somebody's got the other side, the

610
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,000
marketing organization, if they want to
come in and just build that on top.

611
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
So keep blasting them out and try and get
some baits.

612
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And then just doing a lot of things,
updating docs and stuff.

613
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I've created a partnership guide page for
all these kind of requests we get.

614
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It takes ages to kind of evaluate if
they're legit or not.

615
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
So I'm just trying to account for all the
things and put them to that page so we

616
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
don't miss anybody.

617
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
We always get loads of weird Twitter DMs
and emails and stuff.

618
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
We've got Baby Doge trying to buy Ergo.

619
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
They offered to buy Ergo.

620
00:45:51,000 --> 00:46:03,000
and so it's not them but just anything
that comes in we're just having a

621
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:15,000
boilerplate and so don't miss anybody and
yeah so just do me things that last week

622
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
yeah Mark I'll sell them the GitHub links
for a few million dollars if they want

623
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
it's a good deal oh boy nice what else
guys

624
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Anything else?

625
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
We had some topics, but as usual, we
don't stick to any topics whatsoever, but

626
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
it's at least good to have them there to
start.

627
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I have a question.

628
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Hit it Grayman.

629
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And that's for like any other devs that's
been here recently or for a while is how

630
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
do you guys stay sane seeing the entire
space try to like pivot towards layer one

631
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
ZK?

632
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
In this been here, like from the
beginning, like, how does everybody stay

633
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
sane?

634
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Cause I'm seeing it like quietly be
advertised in a lot of spaces.

635
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And it's like, I feel like it's going to
take a lot of years and it's been here

636
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
since 2019, I guess.

637
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And it's like, nobody talks about it.

638
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I think the best way to stay sane is just
not pay attention to be honest.

639
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Yeah, I mean, it's a bit hard to stay
sane in this space at all.

640
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,000
But yeah, it's better to just stay in
some circle, right, which is not as insane

641
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
as the whole space.

642
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
That's how.

643
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I mean, there's worse ways they could be
pivoting.

644
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
At least it seems to be going a bit back
towards our favor.

645
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Sure.

646
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And not just pure nonsense and meme coins
and logs.

647
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And so I kind of see it as an expected
pathway space would take.

648
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
So I'm just glad it's happened.

649
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I try to think of it like a swimmer,
right?

650
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
When a professional swimmer is swimming,
they're not picking their head up every

651
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
second to look at the wall or anything
like that.

652
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
They kind of know where they are.

653
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
and they know their goal is every time
they pick up the head and breathe and then

654
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
put their head back down and swim.

655
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I think of it that way.

656
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
globally with the stuff that I keep
myself busy with, at least locally here

657
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
with what we're trying to do here with
Ergo and with the blockchain and with

658
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
integrating it into everyday things.

659
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
So I look at that goal and think that
goal is going to serve a wider purpose.

660
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
So let me focus on that and push that
through and make sure that works smoothly

661
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
here and show examples and show real live
working things.

662
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
So that's essentially putting your head
down, taking a big breath and pushing

663
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
through and then picking your head up
again, looking around, being like, why is

664
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
the audience smoking crack and humping
dogs?

665
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I'm going to put my head down and work
some more kind of thing.

666
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
So that's how I get through it, at least.

667
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
But it is frustrating to look at these
things and be like, what the hell is going

668
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
on?

669
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Because they advertise it like it's new,
like they just found some new thing.

670
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And it's like, what?

671
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Yeah.

672
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I like the swimming analogy, though.

673
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Yeah, I would just say, try to find
entertainment in the madness and focus on

674
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
building neat things that we find
interesting, right?

675
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:23,000
So it's like, once you have your own
vision of what you want to do, just follow

676
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:31,000
that and let the noise be the noise.

677
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I mean, most of the people that I talk
to, at least I'm like x.com or see people

678
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
posting.

679
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
90% of those people, it's a speculative
tool, right?

680
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
So it's really hard to have serious
conversations with those people.

681
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
But once you get into communities like
Ergo where people are focused on building

682
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
and making a difference and actually
making tools that will outlast them and

683
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
not just, you know, buff their wallet so
they can exit and pay for their house or

684
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
their car or their truck or that kind of
thing, which I get, but, you know, to me

685
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
there's more to it than that, that's for
sure.

686
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Yeah, and I think actually there is a big
request from developers to build in such

687
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
an environment.

688
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I think there is a need to do another
marketing campaign for developers like we

689
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:39,000
did back in 2020.

690
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:46,000
This time probably it should be more
ideological.

691
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Well, there are a lot of developers
willing to change the status quo with

692
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
their work, right?

693
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
But the crypto industry is not allowing
for that these days.

694
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:09,000
There are just very few harbors, right?

695
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Rebel developers can unite and develop
like Ergo.

696
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:29,000
So yeah, it would be good to make another
marketing campaign like that.

697
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Oh, Grayman's got a question.

698
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Hit it, Grayman.

699
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Welcome.

700
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Thanks.

701
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yeah, I just finished my smoking some
crack.

702
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,000
So my question is a little bit out of
left field.

703
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It's about what's happening to Monero
right now in their battle with, what is

704
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
it, Qubit or this come from behind dudes
network.

705
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And my question is, are they going to
move on from, you know, one proof of work

706
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,000
chain to the next, trying to take over
their mining or is that even possible with

707
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,000
a GPU based proof of work chain, much less
an ASIC-mined one.

708
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Is Monero just an especially soft target
because it's CPU-mined, is my question.

709
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
It's hard to say.

710
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's hard to say how successful this
CFB's attack with Monero is.

711
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:51,000
They claimed they were going to do a 51%
attack, but they haven't succeeded.

712
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:58,000
to say maybe even the sponsor so that
they're sponsoring miners definitely with

713
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:05,000
their tokens but maybe it wasn't
profitable for them right maybe they

714
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:12,000
donated basically some tokens after all in
the exchange for marketing because now

715
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:19,000
well it's quite buzzing this.

716
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I don't know.

717
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Yeah, it's crazy.

718
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
What they're doing is they're having
their miners theoretically are supposed to

719
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,000
be contributing to some proof of useful
work AI thing.

720
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
But actually, they're just mining Monero,
which they get compensated in Qubit or

721
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
whatever.

722
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And then they send the Monero to a chain,
change it for USDT.

723
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
and buy Qubit with it, and then they burn
that.

724
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
So it's just a straight up insanity, if
you ask me.

725
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
But that is their business model.

726
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
And evidently, they had a huge chunk of
the Monero hash rate.

727
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
So I just thought it was that just
because it's CPU-mined, and therefore,

728
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
everybody can have it.

729
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Would this even be possible if it were
Ergo, and they had to get people to

730
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
contribute with their GPUs?

731
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
It just seems like maybe the weakness of
Monero.

732
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I don't know.

733
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Probably economically it's disaster,
right?

734
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I mean, probably they're paying more
tokens than they're burning, right?

735
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Basically, so it's just, so they just
basically paying for the attack, right?

736
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Like you can just rent GPUs, CPUs, and
you can rent a botnet probably, right?

737
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And attack Monero blockchain.

738
00:54:51,000 --> 00:55:00,000
and probably it would be even more
efficient but here you also have a lot of

739
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:09,000
marketing coming from Monero community and
not only rights as we are discussing it

740
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:18,000
right now so yeah well I don't know so I
think it's mostly about marketing, right?

741
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So economically, probably this attack is
complete disaster.

742
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,000
But yeah, I mean, but that's typical
CFB's show.

743
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I'm trying to have patience, but I have
to think this is going to end in disaster,

744
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
like you say.

745
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And it's pretty amusing.

746
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Yeah, but after all, it would be
disastrous for this Qubit, right?

747
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:53,000
So if... So the only hope is that supply
would be increased, not supply, sorry,

748
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:00,000
demand would be increased, right?

749
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Because they're increasing supply
probably by inefficiency of this attack,

750
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
right?

751
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
But then they need to increase demand.

752
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
They are trying to do that via this
marketing, right?

753
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:29,000
But if CFB is failing with that then yeah
i mean it's it's it's a bit disastrous

754
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:40,000
probably but also yeah i mean for for for
the whole Qubit and its reputation right

755
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:51,000
if it's proof of useful work for AI but
instead used as kind of botnet

756
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It's in the long term probably not so
good play even.

757
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Yeah, it's just trying to create some
kind of flywheel effect and make a lot of

758
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
noise.

759
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
You know, it's strange or it's like,
okay, let's say that in theory they did

760
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
succeed.

761
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And taking over Monero, right?

762
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,000
They may just destroy the value that's
underpinning their flywheel, and it would

763
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,000
be worse than when they started.

764
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Well, they dumped the Monero.

765
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,000
They dumped the XMR as soon as they can
to get Qubit.

766
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
So it theoretically would drive that
price down.

767
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
But I think the price has been pretty
static for the last few months they've

768
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
been doing this.

769
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
So, I guess the answer to my question is,
regardless of whether GPU would make it

770
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
easier or harder, we probably shouldn't
regard this as a threat because it's just

771
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
so stupid.

772
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I find it entertaining.

773
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
It's one of those things.

774
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
It's kind of strange.

775
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I don't know what it has to do with the
AI or what the usefulness is of the AI.

776
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Does anybody?

777
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Maybe AI came up with a marketing plan,
Joe.

778
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Probably it would be more efficient to
rent a nice hash just, or rent some big

779
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:29,000
farm, something like that.

780
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,000
But yeah, for efficiency of this emulated
mining so you know it's it seems so if I

781
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:44,000
understand right so that they have some
computational task embedded into proof of

782
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:51,000
useful work then you're basically losing
efficiency right for for this emulation

783
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:58,000
basically but

784
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I mean, in comparison with just running
Monero mining function or Ergo mining

785
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
function on hardware, right, on physical
GPU.

786
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,000
So here you have this level of
abstraction, so this Qubit proof of work,

787
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,000
proof of useful work function.

788
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:29,000
So yeah, you're inevitably losing a lot
of efficiency in mining.

789
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:45,000
would be better to just rent hardware,
right, bare metal and deploy miners there.

790
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
So I don't know.

791
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:54,000
So probably just crazy CFB style story.

792
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Artificial stupidity.

793
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Right.

794
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Well, it's five minutes past the hour
almost another successful community AMA.

795
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Thanks for joining everybody.

796
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I think Andy's back next week.

797
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So perhaps we'll take a change and go
back to the original format.
