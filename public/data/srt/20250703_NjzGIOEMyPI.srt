00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let's talk about user experience and
transaction states in a proof-of-work UTXO

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
chain.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In the classic approach, there are only
two transaction states, unconfirmed and

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
confirmed.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
For a seamless user experience, this is
not enough.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We need at least four.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's look at an ERG to Dexy Gold swap as
an example.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We exchange ERG for one Dexy Gold.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
On the left, our transaction appears
immediately.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
At the same time the wallet opens, we
sign and send the transaction.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The transaction enters the mempool, and
two to four minutes later it is included

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
in a new block.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
A transaction can also be cancelled at
any moment, either by the user or by the

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
network.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In the positive case, the transaction
passes through three stages: prepared, in

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
mempool, confirmed.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Everything starts with the status
prepared.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This is what the user should see
immediately after pressing the swap

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
button.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
A short double blink draws attention to
the change, and the status icon remains

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
visible as a bar loader.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
After the user sends the transaction, it
moves to the In Mempool status.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The status icon switches to a circular
loader.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When the transaction is successfully
included in a block, its status changes to

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Confirmed.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The transition is accompanied by a double
blink with green highlighting, and the

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
icon turns into a checkmark.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now let's examine all the cases where a
transaction changes to the cancelled

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
status.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
First, the user cancels the transaction
in the wallet.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Second, the user signs and sends it, but
it is rejected by the mempool.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Third, the user sends the transaction.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It appears in the mempool, but is later
replaced by another one through a higher

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
fee.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Fourth, the transaction is in the
mempool, but its input box becomes

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
invalid.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Fifth, after the transaction enters a new
block and receives the confirmed status, a

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
block reorganization occurs.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Any transition to the cancelled status is
accompanied by a shake animation with red

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
highlighting and the icon switches to a
cross.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Thank you for watching.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Always remember to provide real-time
feedback to your users.
