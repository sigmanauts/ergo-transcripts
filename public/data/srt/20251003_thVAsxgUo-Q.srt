1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Welcome to the weekly community Ergo AMA,
where if you're brave enough to join, you

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
can ask live questions or be tested with
questions from us of why you're an Ergo

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
member and what you want out of this
space.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So please, we encourage you to join on
the link down there in the YouTube

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
channel.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You'll see it down below in the comments.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And hit us up and join the community.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This week we're wrapping up getting ready
to, well, let me say first hi to CQ,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Byron, Aberg, HQ3rr and kushti are all in
the chat with us today. Maybe one of them

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
will turn on their video at some point.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We'll see, takes a little bit to warm up.
But good morning everybody that's here.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Thanks for joining us in person. You guys
there anybody? Yeah, we're still here. All

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
right.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Good morning, kushti.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And then we got some chat people saying,
hey, great.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So we are wrapping up. I'm packing a box
up this weekend and shipping it out to the

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Meetup event space in Colorado, sunny
Colorado Springs.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Shipping out projectors, shipping out
swag for people that are coming, given our

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
video streaming equipment.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So I hope that box doesn't get stolen
actually.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And we're going to stream the talks that
are there to you guys that can't make it

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
in person.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We're looking on some couple kegs to
drink during the party.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And we've got Chris on the hook for
making us Korean barbecue for dinner on

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Saturday night. Kind of all hands on deck.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's going to be a great time. Good
meetup in the fashion of community and

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
sharing so super excited about that.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So yeah. What's new with you guys kushti?
What's new?

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
A lot of things so yeah, you can actually
make all the participants co-hosts.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So yeah, all of them know.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You trust them?

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah. So Aberg is quite well known on
Twitter from three. Byron participated in

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
the last call, right? And EHQ also quite
known.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Great.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They are co-hosts. Kushti is forced to be
co-hosts, guys, so feel free to turn on

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
your cameras if you want to.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No pressure.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What's new, Kushti? What's new this week?

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
A lot of things so yeah, well quite good
developers chat yesterday and well

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
published also some thoughts on the main
telegram group right, not thoughts but

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
observation what's going on so that is
good progress which I see from the USC

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
stablecoin. Unfortunately Richie can't
join us right now because he has some real

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
life.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But yeah, from November, he's promising
to start spending in the community calls.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's great.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
To participate more. So he joined one
call, right? Not only one.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Then yeah what else, then yeah Git
circles, there is quite good progress and

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
the guys are quite preparing for initial
tests in coming weeks of this month and

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
then starting to reach developing
communities right and get developers to

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
build the digital economies on Ergo.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So, well, community, but digital also.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Native digital financial circles and
solutions, right? Around probably the most

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
natural environment for community counts
approach to be applied.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Rights of open source development
circles.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Then yeah, there is good progress with
basis Chain Cash.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So this month we can start some demos and
one developer started to develop wallets.

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So there will be like two phases, right,
of basis.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Well, at least it is how it's seen from
now.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So, there will be some solution for
community trading, right, with off-chain

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
cash backed by Ergo reserves.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And then, yeah, another solution would be
for agents, robots, right.

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So, no wallet needed here, but we need to
do some plugins for existing protocols

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
like A2P, or just existing solutions such
as peer-to-peer networks and agentic

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
networks.

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Then what else? There is now finally a
fix in Nautilus for ledger as well as some

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
more news from Nautilus, right, covering
the dev update.

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And yeah.

69
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If you're reading the dev updates, let me
hit that right now.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We'll pop it on screen.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If that's what you're hitting through.
One second, I need to charge my device

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
also.

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, so you were talking about Git
circles on the dev update.

74
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I made another pull request for a smile
since three left and yeah, so we need

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
actually for Joe to participate more,
right?

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Because a lot of like a storm of tweets,
having regularly, about rooms.

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So, yeah, it seems a lot of insights and
yeah the guys doing a lot here and yeah

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
actually I'm now in touch it's not covered
in dev chats yeah HQ will answer a bit

79
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
later so.

80
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's not covered in the dev chat, but
yeah, I'm also talking with the other guys

81
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
on Monero. right?

82
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So we are doing some, that'd be great.

83
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What's the big challenge with that
kushti, with bridging to Monero compared

84
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
to other chains?

85
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah. So, there is no much fields to
write data we need for rights.

86
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So, and if there are possibilities, there
is need for some well, support for it and

87
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
the users, right?

88
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So there are some protocol possibilities
which are not covered in wallets, right?

89
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And then they're not quite usable anyway.

90
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So yeah, it's quite challenging, but
well, if this is possible, even in some

91
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
ugly ways, then yeah, we are looking for
better ways to do it.

92
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You can't fragment it and spread the data
across several different entries, like

93
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
several different tokens?

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So you can put data in the whole
transaction, right?

95
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So not just you take the whole
transaction, test some fields.

96
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But yeah, the question is also about
world supports and so on.

97
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So it's not that easy, to be honest.

98
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But yeah, we continue to explore
different options.

99
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So at least there are some options, which
is already good.

100
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But yeah, we need to find some solution
which is also quite comfortable for end

101
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
users, right?

102
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Right, right, right. I mean, no, not some
command line scripts.

103
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I don't know, like two hundreds of notes
around the world. Just.

104
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah, makes sense.

105
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Okay. So let's see. And then, yeah, about
keystone.

106
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So, actually, there was updates recently,
there was our group from, not from AnonBR,

107
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
it's not from TGR.

108
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let me check.

109
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Last I see, I remember that he said that
they were waiting on AnonBR to do some

110
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
stuff for Nautilus and he will be maybe
launching an event, a competition for

111
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
custom keystone.

112
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh, yeah. All right.

113
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So then we need to ping AnonBR indeed.

114
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah. So waiting for Keystone. So
Keystone will let you buy a wallet with an

115
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Ergo engraving or an Ergo sticker on the
back.

116
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah, but the community needs to do
something for that. So yeah, that's

117
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
awesome.

118
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Anyone has information?

119
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So, yeah, PGR told, I'm looking into
launching a small design competition for

120
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the Ergo branded Keystone device they
proposed.

121
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
All right. Well, let's see. Let's hit
through the rest of the dev updates that

122
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
we may have missed real quick, and then we
can keep chatting.

123
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So we've got your Git circles there you
already spoke about, Nautilus, fixed web

124
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
hit, ledger-to-ledger interactions,
researching on Bitcoin runes integration.

125
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That'll be awesome.

126
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Machina and Hermes, still working on it
towards an MVP, but nothing relevant to

127
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
report.

128
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Let's see. Bro Etiquette is working on
LLM commands.

129
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Comrades, he's working on Comrades. LLM,
what's he doing with LLMs?

130
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So he is currently writing persistence
layer for Git circles.

131
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh, nice.

132
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Okay. Yeah, quite okay to do this with
LLM comrades.

133
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So actually it's not on the chart, but
yeah. Actually, like two weeks ago, I've

134
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
pushed agents MD rules for the nodes and
the sigma SDK.

135
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So it's going to be a quite important
topic in 2025, right?

136
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And I'm just current different
possibilities to utilize AI agents by

137
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
myself.

138
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And yeah, it seems they quite great in
analyzing the code, right?

139
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So you know, before we just had a white
paper and then the code, right?

140
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But you need to be a developer to get
through the code and extract what's there,

141
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
right, in details.

142
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But now you can just launch an agent and
ask it to analyze the code, right?

143
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Or even write some tests, some
simulations and so on.

144
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Who is that?

145
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Just another spammer. I removed him.

146
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No biggie. Keep going, sir.

147
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Oh, that's Brandon.

148
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah. It seems so trolls, which is quite
great.

149
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's funny.

150
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
All right. So, yeah. So, you know, now,
yeah.

151
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So talking about trolls. So, a lot of
weird trolls, trying to spread lies even

152
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
about some very basic things, right?

153
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But you can now analyze the code with an
AI agent, right?

154
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And yeah, it will tell you about the
detailed properties of distributions,

155
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
well, supply and so on.

156
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So you can ask it to write simulations
tests, write some showcase programs and so

157
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
on.

158
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So yeah, well, it's understandable why
trolls are going mad.

159
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So now it's quite easy to get code
concepts, right? Even without coding

160
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
skills, kind of.

161
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So you just need to well, tech savvy,
right? To install an agent or an IDE with

162
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
a built engine.

163
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Then, yeah, import the project from
GitHub, but it's not about coding skills,

164
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
right? So just tech stuff.

165
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But then, yeah, two weeks ago, I proposed
rules for agents to limit them to just

166
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
working on the testing code, not to touch
the main code, because it's

167
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
security-critical, so it should be done by
humans only, totally reviewed by other

168
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
humans, I believe, because it's
security-critical and yeah, it should be

169
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
developed like an open source project.

170
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But for tests, AI is actually working
great.

171
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's now helping to cover the behavior of
the tests.

172
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah, it actually can help just tech
savvy people to understand what's the

173
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:01,000
rights on the two or combats, wise,
they've been spread around sometimes.

174
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Okay.

175
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yeah. I see you vibe coded a rough
prototype for basis Chain Cash.

176
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's pretty funny.

177
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah, but it's actually sometimes useful
or sometimes absolutely useless.

178
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So yeah, I spent a lot of time to get it
doing well-correct Schnorr signature

179
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
implementation.

180
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So yeah, it's made everything wrong again
and again for multiple times.

181
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yeah. Before I've provided, well,
concrete code from another project, right?

182
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What are you using for, what tool are you
using? Deep Seek.

183
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So it's Cursor and Deep Seek behind.

184
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes. So, so the main part is Cursor,
which is iterative for kind of agent right

185
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:15,000
so it can run tests then write code then
run tests again right it can download

186
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,000
materials and code from internet so it's
yeah like it's not just chat right chat

187
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,000
bot it's like comprehensive toolset.

188
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Which is also, it's not just composing
codes, right? So chatting with you. So

189
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
it's, yeah.

190
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So, or you need to provide permissions,
right? To to write on this or download

191
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
from internet.

192
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And still I'm using clean laptop for it
just in case, to avoid, you know, the

193
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,000
whole disk to be wiped out or, I don't
know, being uploaded to somewhere.

194
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
But yeah, so it's working great at the
same time.

195
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah, I find it rough prototyping those
initial things on the stuff I do here,

196
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
which as some of you know is in Perl joke,
right?

197
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
HG loves Perl.

198
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's so fast. It's extremely fast.

199
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I just puked here, man.

200
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's crazy fast. It gets through that
whole spot of the, you know, I mean,

201
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
because most of the time when I'm writing
stuff for school, at least recycling a lot

202
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
of stuff, right?

203
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So this essentially lets me get past that
stage immediately into some sort of

204
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
testing phase to see what works.

205
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So, yeah, I hear you.

206
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
HQ never uses AI. He just speaks code. It
just comes right out of the fingertips,

207
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
right HQ?

208
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You said fingertip, right?

209
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh, you don't have any fingertips?

210
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
No, I was just referencing to something
else, but I will stop doing that.

211
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh.

212
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
All right, taking silver so it's idea by
Grayman and others cool idea by Grayman

213
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
here if you guys haven't heard it.

214
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Maybe we'll get him to talk more about it
at the meetup and he can stream some of

215
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
that stuff. He's gonna bring a couple
Grayman says yeah I'm gonna bring some

216
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
dime bags to the meetup and I was like
you're gonna bring pot to the meetup? And

217
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
he's like no, no, no I'm gonna bring
silver dimes in little bags and hand them

218
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
out. It's like well, that's a lot
different than a dime bag.

219
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Engrain them.

220
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So that'll be neat to have. He's got some
early century, 52 or maybe earlier, silver

221
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
dimes that he's going to hand out.

222
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Math Spectator started a wallet. kushti
talked about that already.

223
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
We've got Glasgow on the Docs Ergo
Platform improvements.

224
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
He's done some nav tidying up. Start here
overhaul, which is great.

225
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Developer and wallet docs. New developer
guides and wallet area now uses clear

226
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
language and updated links throughout.

227
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
New content, added a page for how to use
a Rosen Ergo on BNB chain.

228
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh, nice. And fixes and polishes,
corrected URLs, text, removed typos, and

229
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
cleared MK docs for him.

230
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Thank you, Sir Glasgow.

231
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Let's see, kushti's got node, protocol
and reference client R&D, mempool and

232
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
wallet support for input box done, writing
a white paper on input ordering blocks,

233
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
generated more tests with an agent on 6.0,
and generated global transfer policy

234
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
contract example, fully in ErgoScript.

235
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Braid version of native support would be
much simpler.

236
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Let's see we got anything else here.
We've got USC stable coin more info about

237
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
that the USC oracle pool version 2
launched by 4 or 5 6.

238
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh, when did that happen?

239
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yeah, so just few days ago. So now we
have four running USC oracle pool.

240
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Amazing. How many oracles did you make
30?

241
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Oh, actually, I don't know. So it was
done solely by PGR, which is quite great.

242
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The time not involved in just another
venture.

243
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah.

244
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So HQ says 12 oracles already in that
pool.

245
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But, yeah, I think it's, yeah, 30 tokens
from what we discussed before the launch.

246
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And, yeah. So now we are discussing with
Richie and the group that is telegram

247
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:54,000
group some launch parameters for the bank
and the LP.

248
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Nice.

249
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
All right. Well, let's see if that is all
right. Good. That's that we got a couple

250
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
of questions.

251
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We can bang out real quick. Let's see.

252
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Oh, here's a tough one. Maybe a little
spicy. Let's see.

253
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Oh, Byron, where are you talking?

254
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Somebody was CQ CQ.

255
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah, I was just going to say before you
jump in on the AI agent stuff or model,

256
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,000
LLMs, DeepWiki works really good for
looking at the various projects repos.

257
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It can, I mean, break it down and give
you a high level summary and ask a

258
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
question.

259
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So anyway, it's just DeepWiki.com or .ai.

260
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It does a great job. I've used it for
Rosen to send information on how Rosen

261
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Bridge works to people and whatnot.

262
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Anyone.

263
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Nice.

264
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Okay. Thanks. It's funny how these.

265
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I think we can do a more exciting thing.
So, my hope to find some time, maybe to

266
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:18,000
prototype some whole application like
dApp, right. It's an agent just.

267
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah, and another idea we discussed
briefly about the dev chat I proposed. So

268
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
we have a lot of ideas from 2020 and now,
yeah, it seems it's possible to white-code

269
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,000
them into the tests, right, for Sigma SDK,
like we did back in 2019 when I designed

270
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,000
the interpreter on the high level of
ErgoScript language.

271
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So, yeah, we did examples like DEX
orders, well, the mixing contract, right,

272
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
which then was evolved into the Ergo Mixer
ICO example, because it was time of ICOs

273
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,000
back then and so on.

274
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And yeah, well, it's quite useful content
right and well as we have for much more on

275
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
the format to make sense to make more
examples now maybe assign small bounties

276
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
for people to do such stuff with agent and
I can just manually review contracts right

277
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
and the testing preppers that there is no
need for humans to bother with it mostly.

278
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So if test is passing, then everything is
okay.

279
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And the replica could be just generated
automatically.

280
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And then, yeah, with that, we can go
further.

281
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So I think as Ergo contracts are
templatizable, actually, they also are

282
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
friendly to AI.

283
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
HQ says, fun fact, it will take him 10
seconds to create a complete marketplace

284
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
with USC token utility trade swap.

285
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I think if I'm not mistaken, that's the
same amount of time it took him to make

286
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
his child.

287
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
So he's pretty good at that. 10 seconds.

288
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm the only one laughing at that. All
right.

289
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Ten seconds, right? Because we just need
a front end to allow the selection of it.

290
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And that's it because it is already
supported in my, in MewMart.

291
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Oh, nice. Nice. Very cool. Very cool.

292
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
All right. Let's see this question. Here
we go.

293
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Sigmanaut says, it would be cool if
someone were to clarify who is still an

294
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
active member of the EF, Ergo Foundation.

295
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Who is responsible for what? Or are they
all afraid of bearing any responsibility,

296
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
thanks in advance?

297
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Kushti, don't answer this one, please.

298
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So...

299
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:10,000
But I have no idea, to be honest. I would
be interested to see an answer.

300
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So we've got Justin, we've got AnonBR,
we've got Allison, we've got Glasgow.

301
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Joe is I think off by now, yeah. I think
that he talked about it a while ago about

302
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
leaving and I think he somewhat made it
official unofficially.

303
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I don't know.

304
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So yeah, you got the core members right
there. During the EF, Glasgow, as you

305
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
know, is structure that you see online.

306
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
That would be the website, the docs,
working with those, all the discords and

307
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
telegrams as well.

308
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
That's his shtick. You have also Andy,
who's running the video show, right?

309
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,000
The EF has Andy involved for that. The EF
also hires Angie as well to do some

310
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
promotions, like some of the Twitter,
what's it called?

311
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You'll see it for the ErgoHack, those
kind of things as well.

312
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Finds writers to help write articles.
Pretty much it as far as that goes.

313
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
You know, we're trying to move everything
as community oriented as possible.

314
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So there used to be a person they paid
for infrastructure and we're trying to

315
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
migrate that to the community
infrastructure.

316
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I know that's taken a little while and
that's on my fault. Oh, MGPi, thanks HQ.

317
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
MGPi joined as well, the EF.

318
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So that's something that I'm trying to
take in on mine, but you know, with the

319
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
meetup front and center it's kind of
slowed down.

320
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I've got some machines I have to take to
Colorado I think to give to yeah I don't

321
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
think yeah there's a payroll person as
well says HQ.

322
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I don't think people know our name I'm
not saying our name people can see it in

323
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
chat but yep so there's that person as
well.

324
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But a couple machines that take the
Colorado handout and another one to ship,

325
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
but I just have to drive by the place to
do that.

326
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So yeah, that's the idea that we're
trying to offload those kind of

327
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
responsibilities to the community so that
the chain can truly be community

328
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
organizing community run as opposed to a
centralized entity doing things and it's

329
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
possible just slow, right?

330
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So eventually. Hopefully, I think at some
point they spoke about the EF being some

331
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
sort of research wing or something like
that.

332
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But even at this point, I don't know what
the possibilities are considering kushti's

333
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
offshot is developer DAO, which could turn
into research and development as well.

334
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So yeah, I mean, when community have the
power to do anything they want with a

335
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
chain, then anything can happen.

336
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And that's great. So yes, that's
hopefully that was a cloudy enough answer

337
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
for you Sigmanaut on that.

338
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Yeah, so on the ErgoDevs DAO site, we
have quite a lot of bounties proposed for

339
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,000
different issues, and thanks to our recent
crowdfunding campaigns done by some

340
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,000
community members, I don't know.

341
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
But yeah, we now have a bigger budget, so
we can do some more aggressive promotion

342
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
among developers.

343
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And then yeah, I'm also investigating
possibilities to do a commercial company,

344
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
so vibrate and so on.

345
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:52,000
is about that, so I think it could be a
good time.

346
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Bitcoin, for example, had a Blockstream
back in 2015, so I think it could be the

347
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
same.

348
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
They also had a Bitcoin foundation at
some point.

349
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Then, yeah, Blockstream and now from what
I see, so the core developers are

350
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
sponsored by a few, actually not many,
like three or four commercial companies,

351
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
right?

352
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It's important to have different entities
to avoid protocol development to be taken

353
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
by one party just.

354
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:52,000
It also would be great to see more
commercial entities around Ergo.

355
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Yeah, well, it would be good in a way to
start with one, even like Monero, because

356
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Tari loves, right?

357
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And Bitcoin had a Blockstream, aside of
mining businesses back in 2015, maybe.

358
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So yeah, it was a Blockstream only, I
believe.

359
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Right, and yeah and then with time.

360
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
So what do we need is to have like a
stable foundation and I believe we have it

361
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
right like foundational documents like
manifesto and so on white paper.

362
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Then yeah maybe there is need to compose
more but what do we need is to develop

363
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Ergo itself as well open source kind of
project and yeah, the goal is to get the

364
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,000
protocol to provide a global neutral
settlement layer for programmable money,

365
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:07,000
right, of different kinds.

366
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Where the native cryptocurrency, the
proof-of-work cryptocurrency ERG is just

367
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:23,000
the lowest common denominator, so the
collateral of the best quality, because of

368
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:31,000
it's been native, right, in the first
place.

369
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So, yeah, well, we had a lot of talks, a
lot of things written here and there over

370
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
the years, so maybe it makes sense to
compile all this.

371
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Yeah, we need to strengthen the
foundation and to grow.

372
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So that doesn't make sense to rely on
some entity, right, to do everything.

373
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So it's the time for that is over. And he
actually over like a couple of years ago.

374
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I think so. Now it's time to to grow in
all the directions.

375
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So Sigmanaut has a follow-up. He says,
thanks for the answer.

376
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's just a bit weird as a long-term
community member not to be informed about

377
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
major changes in the EF.

378
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Community approach is great, but not
without officially informing the

379
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
community.

380
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah, Sigmanaut, I would say that we've
been very clear about this in AMAs and

381
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Telegram chats and Twitters about people
leaving, about people joining the

382
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
foundation.

383
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Many, many times during AMAs, we've
discussed about what the idea of the EF is

384
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
and what their goal was and what it is.

385
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And the goal was to have a foundation
that could help bootstrap the community,

386
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
right?

387
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And then slowly fade out into whatever.
either non-existence or a research

388
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
foundation or something else that just
helps with maintaining things.

389
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So that's been, ever since I've joined,
that's been what I've spoken about it in

390
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
public, as well as what has been spoken
about in the channel.

391
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So I think we've been, probably not
recently been clear about it, but it has

392
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
definitely been a topic many times
throughout the last several years about

393
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
what that is going to look like.

394
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So I hear you, but yeah.

395
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Okay.

396
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And yeah, and according to the white
paper, so the original plan was to have

397
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
this bootstrapping entity for two years
and a half, right?

398
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And now it's a year past, so yeah, it's
actually well, long overview, but it is

399
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
what it is.

400
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So still, yeah, it's doing some needed
things, right? The sanctity, but yeah,

401
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:11,000
well, we need to act towards growth and
well, I think, and yeah, it's going from

402
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:18,000
the white paper, right?

403
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And the white paper was published back in
2019, a few months before the mainnet

404
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
launch.

405
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And that's, yeah, well, there was no plan
ever to have this bootstrapping entity to

406
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:46,000
to control the growth forever.

407
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's limited simply by the white paper.

408
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Yep, yep, yep.

409
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Okay, we've got another question from,
let's see, from Willem Jan Vandenberg.

410
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Is there a cooperation between Ergo and
Palmyra? Are they building Palmyra

411
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
platform on Ergo and Cardano?

412
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Perhaps one of you could provide clarity
on this, thanks in advance.

413
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
The best person to answer that probably
is Luca or Dan I think MGPi is not

414
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
necessarily involved in that specific part
of it in Palmyra last time I asked him but

415
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
the bottom line you have to remember yes
we've seen Winter Protocol being ported to

416
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Cardano and running on there but the
bottom line you have to remember and the

417
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
best I can answer right now without being
involved with Palmyra is that one Ergo's

418
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
an open chain people are going to use it
right two.

419
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
nothing compared to Cardano. Scalability
of fees, network fees, to create all these

420
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
tokens and tracking is I don't think
feasible on Cardano necessarily compared

421
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
to how feasible it is on Ergo.

422
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So as a company when you look at two
things and you're saying okay I can run my

423
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Winter Protocol on this chain but it's
going to cost my clients this much and I'm

424
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
going to have to pass that cost on to them
or I can run on this chain and the cost is

425
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
less from a straight business decision.

426
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It's obvious which chain is going to be
utilized for that.

427
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So that's just where I think in my mind.
And I think that's probably what you'll

428
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
see in the future once Dan's business gets
in full swing with that kind of stuff.

429
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Yeah, so I cannot probably because we had
a lot of talks with Dan and Sam, but not

430
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,000
in recent months.

431
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Back in February, we were around
consensus conference and before in Dubai,

432
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
we had a lot of talks.

433
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So, you know, Palmyra is a real-world
assets company and then, yeah, it all

434
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
depends on their real-world partners.

435
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So, almost one year ago, we discussed to
use Dexy or Dexy lithium stable coin to do

436
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:14,000
insurance for lithium in Argentina but now
for many months I haven't heard anything

437
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:23,000
about lithium in Argentina.

438
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Do you guys know anything about it?

439
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah. I mean, it, it heavily depends on,
the needs of real world partners of

440
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Palmyra as well. Right. So we discussed
some things and yeah, well, there are

441
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,000
certain contracts implemented, I've
removed them and so on.

442
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,000
But then, yeah, it all depends on
concrete things on the ground, after all,

443
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
right, because it's a real world assets
company.

444
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So the best thing we can do is to invite
then or look and ask them, right?

445
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Because so here we don't have, anyone,
deeply connected with Palmyra, right?

446
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So yeah, the the the best think we can.

447
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Yeah.

448
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Maybe we should invite Sam next time. I
think he's expressed interest in these

449
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
kinds of AMA.

450
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yeah. So Sam is quite devoted to
Ergonauts actually.

451
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:44,000
But, yeah, well, the thing is, you know,
it's still a super early startup and yeah

452
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:53,000
they are changing playing plans regularly
which is quite normal and yeah it all

453
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:02,000
depends on external actors as well right
because.

454
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Yeah, well, a lot of instability in
jurisdictions they're working with and

455
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
yeah, a lot of instability in the
development of this space, real world

456
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
assets.

457
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It depends on many factors such as legal
and so on, right?

458
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It would be good to invite them and have
a detailed chat instead of trying to

459
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
invent something on our site.

460
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Yeah, agreed. Yeah, I'll ping Sam. We'll
see what he says.

461
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
OK, let's see what else we have here.

462
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
We have in Zoom chat, HQ has asked, how
optimistic do you feel if we invited all

463
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
mining pool operators in creative mining
DAO and move the important chain votes on

464
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Paideia instead of doing with changing
node settings as we do it now?

465
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So HQ, I would say that I would say the
de facto final change is always going to

466
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
be on the node config, right?

467
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So that's always the change period. So no
matter what you do in a DAO, on chain on

468
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
the DAO, no matter what you do, things
will not take effect unless miners tag

469
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
along and update their node configs to do
that, right?

470
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So what's that?

471
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
So, actually, you can build some logic on
top of the node to read, well, voting

472
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
decisions from DAO and change config
automatically.

473
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
But in reality, it wouldn't change
anything really, right? Because, well, you

474
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,000
can just tweak the settings instead of
using web interface still.

475
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You can always get around it. Yes,
correct. Yeah, exactly.

476
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,000
So that's HQ. That's the idea of what the
SIGS mining DAO was at some point, right?

477
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
To educate and to get people together to
group them up and have them interested in

478
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
tracking these changes and pushing these
changes and even proposing things, right?

479
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And then pushing from there. But yeah, I
mean, it'd be neat.

480
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Actually, GitBlock used this, right, for
some software.

481
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Right, right. Yeah, they did the wallet
voting for the software. Exactly. Yep,

482
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
yep, yep.

483
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
So these things have that in the dial
right there, but it's not tied to a direct

484
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
change on the node, that's for sure.

485
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But yeah, I think my thought would be
that if it could be iron clad, if there

486
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
was some sort of soft fork that changed it
so that this is exactly where we're

487
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
getting all details to, you could undo
that at some point.

488
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
So it's not de facto in the end. The only
de facto thing and the only fact is that

489
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
miners can run a config and have a chain.

490
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So while we can't police that
essentially, at least you can have a group

491
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
organization like a DAO, like the SIGS
mining DAO. to at least gather people in

492
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and have discussions before those things
are even tried to push to GitHub for

493
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
changes.

494
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
That's one of the things which I was
talking, at least you have a ledger of

495
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
on-chain voting and what we discussed,
what was put up on vote, who talked on

496
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
that.

497
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
We can at least have that. There are many
people who are trying to bring the

498
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
innovation and they're trying it.

499
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
But I think the thing is that we have
tools which are not getting used.

500
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So what we have to do is adapt the people
to use those.

501
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So how do we get, so the great idea would
be to create a mining DAO or modify the

502
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
SIGS mining DAO and invite all the pools
out there.

503
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Invite every single pool out there as
well as any individual miners we have and

504
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
see if they'll participate.

505
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
My guess is that we're probably not going
to see much participation in a mining DAO

506
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
from big pools, right?

507
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Ergo is just one facet of this massive
amount of other chains that they do.

508
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Maybe you will, I don't know, like
Herominers is really good to us, right?

509
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
What's the other one?

510
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Unless there is an incentive for them,
right? You can always mint a DAO token and

511
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
you can have an LP there for it.

512
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
So people are seeing that it is a DAO
which is working DAO and people are doing

513
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
stuff.

514
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So there might be price change in them.
The only source of getting those tokens

515
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
would be by participating in the DAO
because they are staking, they will be

516
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
staking and they will be getting using the
DAO emission.

517
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
That's it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
True. True.

518
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
It's like pre-confirmation votes before
the electoral votes. You got it. Yeah.

519
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Yep.

520
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But yeah, it can act as campaigns.

521
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Like constitutional conventions. Yeah.

522
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Yeah. But it still separates it from, so
you can say this is the vote, but this is

523
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
the actual votes.

524
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It's like pre-voting.

525
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Yep.

526
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Yeah. Yeah, and the idea would be, right,
if you got everybody on board that's part

527
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
of the DAO, then you could be pretty sure
that the node config changes and people

528
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
would change their node configs and follow
through kind of thing.

529
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And your votes actually ensure that the
pool operators actually show up because

530
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
the nodes that are pointing to them voted
for them to show up.

531
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So you can de-stake, I suppose, or
whatever.

532
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Yeah, that'd be interesting. If Mark,
maybe Mark, when Mark watches this later

533
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
from the SIGS DAO, maybe he could start
thinking about getting other mining pools

534
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
involved in the DAO.

535
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Just because it's called Sigmanauts
mining, my DAO doesn't mean it has to be

536
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
just for the Sigmanauts mining pool.

537
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
It's just labeled Sigmanauts, I guess, at
that point.

538
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
So yeah, Mark, if you're watching this,
what are your thoughts on that?

539
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
When you wake up, probably sleeping,
because your baby's been awake all night,

540
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
right?

541
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So, cool.

542
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
All right, what else we got? What time is
it? 9.52.

543
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
We got another question. Here we go. From
Zoom Chat.

544
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
That would be from Aberg. Says, does Ergo
have the capabilities of launching an

545
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
XMR-like privacy coin?

546
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
kushti, on the sub chain?

547
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yeah for sidechain it's possible and
actually one of the earliest ideas for

548
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
sidechains.

549
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:38,000
There is no any white paper or written
proposal but yeah possible.

550
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
So one option we discussed in the charts
is to do DarkFi based sidechain, but

551
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
DarkFi is not around yet.

552
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
So DarkFi is an merged mine sidechain of
Monero, which is bringing capability to

553
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
execute private contracts.

554
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:07,000
But yeah, it's in development yet. There
is only some early testnet and yeah. Well,

555
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:14,000
it makes sense to wait till launch or a
moment when it will be stabilized at

556
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,000
least. Right.

557
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:29,000
And would there be, would there be a need
for a mixer besides saving money on

558
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
bridging, when you have a privacy chain, a
side chain like that?

559
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Sorry. Would there be a need for
ErgoMixer at that point besides the fact

560
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
that you'd save money running ErgoMixer if
you just bridged to the side chain and

561
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
then slowly came out on other endpoints
kind of thing utilizing the privacy side

562
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
chain as a mixer?

563
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I don't know, so you can actually exit
from the side chain to the mixer on the

564
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
main chain, right? Or stealth address.

565
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Yeah, I think it still would be useful.
Just for different tasks, maybe. Subtasks.

566
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Gotcha.

567
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Cool.

568
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Well, anything else, guys?

569
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
We have a reduction coming up. I thought
we'd bring that up.

570
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Oh, nice. Byron. What's it going to?

571
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I think is what sub double digits now. Is
it nine?

572
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Is it the first single digit?

573
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Wow. That's crazy.

574
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Yeah.

575
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Yeah. Yeah, so QX, I think there is need
to tweet and yeah, I think maybe next time

576
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:54,000
let's discuss Twitter strategy X strategy.

577
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Let me use these few seconds to again
invite people up to trial on the

578
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Sigmanauts account and then jump up to
Ergo or show experience that you've had

579
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
and jump right up to the Ergo platform.

580
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
We would love more contributors to
Twitter. I tweet when I can, and that's

581
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
about it.

582
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And then Glasgow tweets sometimes as
well.

583
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
But yeah, if you're interested, please
let us know.

584
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
And we'll either look at the previous
tweets you've done and take you right to

585
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
the Ergo Platform one, or you can trial
run on the Sigmanauts Twitter and then

586
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
jump up to the Ergo Platform Twitter.

587
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So please, please help.

588
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I think someone asked when sub-blocks and
I think it's what mid November ish or end

589
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
of the year. It's time for it.

590
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I think he's joking, but when sub-blocks.

591
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Oh no, he means the voting. Oh yeah.
Yeah. Right. When's that, when's that come

592
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
into effect, kushti?

593
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
6.0 or what do you mean?

594
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
The vote's happening, right? Or when does
that actually switch?

595
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
So 6.0 will be activated in a few days,
like five days.

596
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Five days?

597
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Yeah, it's like 3,000 or 3,500 blocks,
something like that.

598
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So, yeah, just like, five days.

599
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I guess we need to tweet that too.

600
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Yeah. That's two things I have to tweet.
kushti. That's going to, that's going to

601
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
send me back a week or two.

602
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Yeah. So there is a lot of materials for
tweeting, right?

603
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So, we have a lot of things are discussed
in the Telegram chats, unfortunately, and

604
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:46,000
not going beyond that, right?

605
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:53,000
So there is need to tweet for more, to
use forum for more.

606
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Because forum is good for archival
purposes and yeah, to have more articles

607
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
and so on.

608
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
You know, I think I can point an agent at
the Telegram chat and just come up with

609
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
daily tweets from those discussions and
the dev chat.

610
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Maybe I'll try that. That might help out
a little bit in the meantime.

611
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Yeah, and yeah, even things which are
announced to our telegram groups. Such as

612
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:23,000
main even and dev updates and so on.

613
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So yeah, makes sense to to tweets at
least great idea kushti great idea.

614
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Yeah, we also need for like, catchy
tweets, more like I don't know

615
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
revolutionary tweets because drama kushti.

616
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
We had done with drama for the week or
the month or we have enough drama. I guess

617
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
it's a new month.

618
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I don't know about drama, but I think we
always need to remind about principles and

619
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:01,000
so on while the manifest, when it was
tweeted for the last time like years ago.

620
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,000
New people are coming all the time and
well, my impression is that many Ergonauts

621
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,000
are considered a community as something
stable, right?

622
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
It's like a small circle of their friends
they're chatting with and so on.

623
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
But in reality, new people are coming all
the time and that there is need to

624
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,000
introduce them things which are very known
to the old members, right?

625
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:39,000
But still newcomers need to get into
them. To remind about principles and yeah,

626
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:47,000
to build everything for growth, not for
staying in the small circles.

627
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:54,000
in some charts. I mean, that's not the
way to get any adoption.

628
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Yeah, I agree. It's manpower, too,
though. So, yeah.

629
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So, please, anybody who wants to help out
with Twitter, that'd be great.

630
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
HQ just reminded us that Mark, sorry,
Glasgow used to do weekly summaries in

631
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
chat.

632
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
And I don't think I've seen those lately.
But those are AI runs. So, there's no

633
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
reason that we can't then extract from
that already agent that he's doing that

634
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
with to bring out tweets for the next week
kind of thing as well.

635
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So let me work with Mark or Glasgow and
we'll see if we can get those back up and

636
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
see if we can extract tweets from these to
do from all the channels.

637
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So yeah.

638
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Yeah, and another point is don't forget
about national groups.

639
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,000
So back in 2020, we built a network of
national groups, Chinese, Indonesian,

640
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Russian, French, Spanish, and so on,
right?

641
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:55,000
So it makes sense to even auto-translate
and publish, well, automatic translation

642
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,000
or ping moderators of national groups,
right?

643
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Yeah, so from our observations many of
them are disconnected from the news stream

644
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,000
and that's quite unfortunate because we
basically have maybe more people there in

645
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
total than in English groups.

646
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Right. So the, the main and, what else we
have mining concern. So, the, there are

647
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
national groups about mine concern.

648
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Yeah. And then in total, more people
stay, but, they have forgotten often.

649
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:49,000
All right. We'll do better with that.
We'll try to, are you a miner?

650
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Is my mic up? Oh, I have my monitor in my
living room, but it's not set up.

651
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I need to set it up. I need to set it up.

652
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,000
But I was going to ask if the ERG-1 could
serve as like also using the DAO framework

653
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,000
as well to pick a community member like
the usual ones that we see that do a great

654
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,000
job on their own promoting to like help
you cold produce tweets and then they can

655
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,000
show that they are who they are that's
producing it.

656
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Obviously their main account and tweet
from the account to help you out as like

657
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
winning the whatever the ERG-1 reward is a
week or a month or whatever it is or

658
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
something like that and rotate it.

659
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
So it's like community active actions.

660
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
So you're talking about getting those
people from ERG-1 involved and helping

661
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
send tweets and write tweets and pull good
tweets from their database of what's been

662
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
leaderboard that week?

663
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Basically, approved members that's been
in the community for a while that already

664
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
support Ergo could help you produce tweets
on the main chat since you have other

665
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
things in real life and things to do as
well as work on Ergo that could help you

666
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
out, especially since they pick a winner
for something.

667
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I forget the frequency and it'll rotate.
So it's like an active community involved,

668
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
like even membership.

669
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Right, right. Yeah, so people write their
tweets and then they submit them to the

670
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
site and then depending on how many
retweets or likes they get or views, I

671
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
think that's how they're ranked, right?

672
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
So yeah, I mean that's a treasure trove
of probably really good Ergo tweets that

673
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
are promoting Ergo that could be used.

674
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
So yeah, all right. All right. So let's
see what Glasgow and let's see what Guifa,

675
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Guifa, Guifa, Guifa.

676
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I'm saying I'm butchering the name from
ERG-1. Have to say HQ knows what it is.

677
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Good friend of HQ's.

678
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
All right. Sounds good, guys. It's 10.03.
I'm already three minutes late for my next

679
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
meeting.

680
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Guifa.

681
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
G-I-U-F-A. Thank you, HQ.

682
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Great. All right. Everybody, any closing
words?

683
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Byron, you want to close it out? kushti,
you got any closing words?

684
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Oh, kushti had to go. kushti was like,
okay, goodbye.

685
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
kushti Irish goodbye. Byron, close it
out. Go for it.

686
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
We're going to be in the clouds in
Colorado. Enjoy your weekend, guys.

687
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
That's right. Thanks everybody for
joining. Ciao.
