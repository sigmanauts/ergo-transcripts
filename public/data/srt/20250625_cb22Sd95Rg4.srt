1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And I'm CannonQ.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We worked on a project with qx() who's
busy on a lake somewhere.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In Georgia.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So yeah, so this is CodeUTXO. We're
revolutionizing blockchain development

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
with AI, making Ergo development
accessible to everyone through AI power

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
tools and natural language interfaces.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And so basically we wanted to package
something that would address all of this.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Because, from my experience within Ergo,
there's definitely a steep learning curve.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And so you maybe think you know the ins
and outs, but then when actually

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
developing and how to actually do
something on chain or using the data from

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the chain, it's more of a user issue.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And so we wanted to alleviate that.
There's a bunch of different documentation

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
from here to there. Most of it really
good, but again, there's just a lot of

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
data and, trying to eliminate... I don't
know, what do you think, CannonQ?

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, yeah, I mean, end of the day, we
were trying to find a way to basically

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
compile a lot of what's out there but make
it to where you can ask questions of AI. I

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
mean, Marc's been big on trying to
spearhead different AI things in the Ergo

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
community and this Ergo hack was a nice
fit for this project we'd been talking

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
about.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And so, yeah, it's making the chain
accessible, making it accessible for

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
programmers based on other GitHub repos
and things like that where you can query

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
those or try to get examples from those,
get examples from the chain or get

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
information from the chain. So yeah, it's
trying to make it all accessible.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, and then I think there are the
documents, right, but there's just a lot,

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
it would just be easier if we could just
have AI talk to it. And then specifically

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
with developing, you have to have the
right context to do a lot of different

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
things.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And so hopefully with this tool, we're
providing the right context, creating

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
tools that allow you to just grab things
and move on from there.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So moving into that, our solution, we
have an AI chat interface. The platform

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
itself will have a native payment system.
So you can pay with ERG, pay with native

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
tokens. And then the two tools that we've
developed is what's called the Ergo MCP or

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
the blockchain query MCP, and then the
price data MCP.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And so the blockchain query basically
allows and utilizes the Ergo node through

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
a natural language interface. You don't
really have to understand what the APIs

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
are, what they do. Really what you need to
do is tailor your prompt and then ask that

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
question if, of course, the tool is
available.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And I mean that in the sense of just like
if we have that tool. So for example, if

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
you were gonna hammer a piece of wood
together, you need a nail. And so we just

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
make sure, if there isn't a tool,
definitely reach out. We'd probably most

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
likely be happy to create that.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Price data MCP, very similar. Grabs that
price data from Crux Finance. And we're

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
looking at other ways to be able to grab
live price data from DEXs.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So if you wanna cover the technical
architecture.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, I'm the right guy to cover this. So
actually, it's sort of funny. I hacked

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
this together. Marc had sent me sort of a
how-to guide, and so I put this up on a

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
server currently. qx() has this now, like
we're self-hosting this.

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But basically, OpenWebUI, it looks and
feels like if you're on Anthropic or Grok

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
or ChatGPT, ask it questions, it gives you
responses or it goes through the

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
responses.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
LiteLLM, basically it's a great tool set
for managing AI models or LLMs. So

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
currently for the Ergo hack we really
truncated everything and just put it into

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
small buckets. We're using GPT 4.0 but in
the coming weeks to month there will be

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
access to various levels of LLMs from
something simple like Gemini 2 or Claude

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,000
3.7, all the way up to Claude Opus, like
the latest one.

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So it allows us to route the API,
everything else, back to those LLMs and

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
then bring the data back to you.

59
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The MCP servers that Marc has created,
they sit there, you ask the question of

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
the, right now, ChatGPT 4, you ask the
question. It then goes, okay, what do I

61
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
need to do, right? And so it passes that
info to the MCP server.

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It actually is doing the queries of the
Ergo node or doing the research from the

63
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Ergo docs we've already provided it, sends
it back to you.

64
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And so, what's nice about the way this is
all set up is you can do standard queries

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
LLM like hey help me with some code do
some other things like just to build a

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
project or to sharpen your own tool set
and then you can plug in on the Ergo side

67
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and these MCPs Marc's more adept at
explaining this but what I like is they're

68
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
almost like little silos of data that we
can create.

69
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So what he showed earlier is we have the
one that talks to the node or to the node

70
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
APIs, and then we also have a separate one
that's working on pricing, but there's

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
other things. So we can work with other
sets of data that we want them to

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
basically connect with or help coders on,
developers on their code and connecting to

73
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
the API sources themselves.

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah, absolutely. And the cool thing
about MCP servers is really, you can make

75
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
a tool for anything that you want. So I
saw somebody made a code repo for

76
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
validating smart contracts.

77
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So what's to say someone creates an MCP
or I can create one, put that into our

78
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
service here or even download it and put
it into cursor or something like that. All

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
you have to do is paste in or point to
your smart contract. Then it runs that in

80
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
the back end and says, hey, it doesn't
work or hey, it does work.

81
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So really what we're working on doing
with the MCP service is really

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
streamlining the whole process in some
sense with the context of Ergo.

83
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Right. And then so the Ergo payments,
that's the last thing on this slide, but

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
it's connect to Nautilus, make the payment
so you're buying the credits or the tokens

85
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
to be able to feed the LLM or your
interaction with the servers.

86
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Sweet, so yeah, so our MCP or model
context protocols, again, we already

87
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
touched this, but directly connects to
your node, natural language queries, so

88
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
for example, give me the top 10 holders of
this specific token ID, and then it

89
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
returns a formatted token holder address
and balance.

90
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So price MCPs, real-time price feeds,
native token tracking, historical data, so

91
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
right, what's the price of ERG from the
last 10 days?

92
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And then again, talking about why we're
doing this, so we're really empowering the

93
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
community, the ecosystem. So traders, this
might be a good thing to take a look at.

94
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We could have further MCPs that are more
trading focused, where you're looking at

95
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
specific metrics tied to some sort of
historical perspective.

96
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Developers, so now it's probably, even
with AI in and of itself, without our

97
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
tools, it's a lot easier to stand up
something, but now inject our tools into

98
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
that. It's definitely a lot easier to
interact and build stuff on top of Ergo.

99
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And then for newcomers, like we wrote
here, a gentle introduction to blockchain

100
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
concepts. You can really explain it, say,
hey, how did we come to this conclusion?

101
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And then our knowledge base is curated
from the community. So all the various

102
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Ergo docs, code bases, smart contracts,
etc., it's all loaded up into that for

103
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
your usage.

104
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And so here's sort of an example of what,
right? So what's the current block height?

105
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And then it's like 1.1 million, two,
three, four, five, six. And then again,

106
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
show me the price of our trends in the
last three days. Here we go. But of

107
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
course, we'll actually give you guys a
live demo.

108
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, CannonQ, you wanna cover this one?

109
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah, sure. So the tooling, we've stood
this stuff up, put it together during the

110
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Ergo hack. The payments, so there's no way
to give this stuff away for free, right?

111
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Someone has to pay for the models, someone
has to pay for the servers, all these

112
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
kinds of things.

113
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So what we've tried to do is, I always
wanted to get like a subscription

114
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Anthropic, but I'm cheap, right? Because I
didn't want to pay 20 bucks a month.

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The way we've set this up, what it allows
us to do is basically you can buy credits

116
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
as little as like basically one ERG or two
ERG worth of credits. You can see what

117
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
your usage is after you do the question on
the query like literally real-time you'll

118
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
see it ticking down also when you're doing
the query after it's responded to you you

119
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
can see how many tokens to use, what was
the volume usage there so again right now

120
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
we just have 4o that we're presenting to
you guys but you'd be able to use

121
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
something less expensive to start and then
if you're really digging in go to a Claude

122
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Opus or something more expensive, Gemini
2.5, something like that.

123
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But the cool thing about it is basically
your credits don't die. So it's fair, it's

124
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
transparent, and you don't have to pay out
like a monthly subscription. You can buy

125
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
what you need, which I think for people
that are new to the ecosystem or casual

126
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
users, I think it's cool.

127
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can say, hey, show me, give me some
research on Cypex. Give me some research

128
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
on the Rosen token. I mean, you can start
messing around and saying stuff that you

129
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
can't easily see in Explorer or just by
looking at the chain. Because most normal

130
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
folks aren't coders, even though there's a
ton in the Ergo ecosystem.

131
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So, and there's a lot of opportunities
obviously that we're looking at how to

132
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
people make their own MCP servers, plug it
in here, get a cut. I mean, there's just

133
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
all kinds of different things. We're
trying to figure out how to make it a

134
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
community effort, not us driving the ship
the whole time.

135
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah, absolutely. And then even goes to
say for say you have like a beefy setup,

136
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
you want to host your own LLM, plug that
into our system and somehow, and then you

137
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
can, we can call your LLM, serve that to
people, figure that out.

138
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And then the MCP servers, a lot of these
tools are really built for users, but I'm

139
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
sort of building them in the mindset as
well as for AI agents. So they're going to

140
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
need to be able to pull stuff from the
chain like block heights, the price of

141
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Ergo for like a trading bot and things
like that.

142
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So a lot of this is very foundational
layers and hopefully continue to build

143
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
upon and say, once we have all these MCP
servers, you can make an AI agent that has

144
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
a specific workflow and maybe you rent
that out and then people can run that

145
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
workflow and you can rent it, they get a
cut, something like that, or just straight

146
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
up buy in sort of a marketplace fashion.
So a lot of possibilities here.

147
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And so for our roadmap, we have the core
foundation here. So the core platform, be

148
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
able to buy credits, the LiteLLM running
in the background to manage our users,

149
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
OpenWebUI, serving everything together,
the MCP servers.

150
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We want to make some future enhancements,
so again, more MCP servers, UI

151
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
improvements on our front end. Community
features even as well. And then I'd really

152
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
like to have some sort of trading agents.

153
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The biggest hurdle right now is just
getting some code set up to interact with

154
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
the smart contracts on the DEXs. And then
once we have that, it's just a matter of

155
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
just coding them up and then giving them
the logic to run on their own. And that

156
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
part I feel like is the easiest.
Ironically, the AI part's easiest.

157
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So again, DeFi integration, advanced
analytics relative to the trading agents.

158
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah, and go back for one second. I think
the other thing that's sort of crazy is

159
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
the more MCP servers. So the more that the
community interacts with us, gives ideas,

160
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
or builds on their own, things can get
plugged in.

161
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So it's not a, again, like we're trying
to, as much as we can decentralize this,

162
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
right, make it a community effort, not a
top down. We had joked, hey, it'd be cool

163
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
if there's price stuff, and Marc hacked
that thing together in a couple days.

164
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Maybe he'd been thinking about it for a
long time, but it was like, I mean, it was

165
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
a couple days, and it's like, hey, check
this out. This is pretty cool.

166
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You can do a lot of amazing stuff once
you have the base tooling set up. And

167
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,000
that's what excites me about this project
is creating the platform or a base layer

168
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
for everything to stack upon.

169
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I sort of, throughout this whole thing,
we sort of said, oh yeah, the web UI, the

170
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
LiteLLM, there's a lot of heavy lifting
that qx() did that's like, let me think

171
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
about it, and it's, there's a lot of
stubbed toes and busted knuckles on

172
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
getting this thing to where it's at right
now.

173
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And I'm just really excited to see how we
can grow on top of this, right? Grow the

174
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
community on top of this and give people
access to better modeling, better data

175
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
sets.

176
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah, for sure. And I think too, like
we've been in the weeds for a little

177
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
while, so it'd be kind of cool to come out
of that for a little bit and then see what

178
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
other people sort of think in terms of
tooling like MCP servers and whether they

179
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
make them their own or give us the ideas,
that's gonna be pretty exciting.

180
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And yeah, like the MCP servers, I feel
like were the easiest part of this

181
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
project, ironically, for the whole AI
thing.

182
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
They're easy for you, dude.

183
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
True, yeah.

184
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
They're not easy for me and that's part
of it though, right? Like the MCP server

185
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and you sort of hammered it home for me,
but why they're great for what we're doing

186
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
is they're really good at like hitting
APIs, right? And like getting data, taking

187
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
the request, getting the data and
massaging it. I mean, that's sort of

188
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
what's nice about them, right?

189
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Versus doing a big, I think we started
five months ago talking about let's build

190
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
a huge RAG, right? And that's sort of
shifted to this a bit. So yeah, it's

191
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
exciting.

192
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Absolutely. So I mean, yeah, our expected
impact, I mean, I think some of this is

193
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
ambitious, right? But go home.

194
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So, 10x faster development. I mean,
honestly, for me, using the MCP servers,

195
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
especially with the Ergo MCP, when I've
been using it, that definitely makes

196
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
things a lot easier for when I'm trying to
develop something.

197
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
There's something that I've been wanting
to make some time. It was sort of like a

198
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
token ID look up for users for total
tokens or collections and things like

199
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
that. So that's connected with MCP, but
now it'll be a lot easier to code. And so

200
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
probably can use a lot of the same code as
well.

201
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So really want to showcase that over
maybe the next couple of months, how easy

202
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
it is to set that up.

203
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And even from the documentation
perspective, the tools are now open

204
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
source, so if you want to clone the Ergo
MCP, the price MCP, feel free to do so and

205
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
build upon it, contribute, that would be
fantastic.

206
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And there's some other ideas that we
have, from like, actually instead of just

207
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
trading with AI agents, more or less using
AI agents to curate sort of a knowledge

208
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
library. And so instead of creating
content for humans, we're gonna create

209
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
content for AI.

210
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And so then that would make our knowledge
base more robust. And then when your

211
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
humans are interacting with that, it makes
it a lot more easier to get to what you

212
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
want.

213
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I mean, yeah. Look at his MCP servers. If
you're that kind of guy or gal, tackle it,

214
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
figure it out and say, Hey, in a week,
let's see who gives us one. I'd love

215
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
someone so we can plug in another one and
just keep growing this thing.

216
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah, absolutely. And like, once you have
the API, this is really easy. I think when

217
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I first made the Ergo MCP, the initial
version that took me like an hour to do,

218
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and then the Ergo Price MCP to the state
where it's at now took me like four to six

219
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
hours, so it really wasn't that long a
time, and plus I'm like vibe coding it the

220
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
entire time, so that definitely was
helpful.

221
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So, with that, supportive vision, with
what we're building, we have some various

222
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
advantages that we sort of talked about,
right? The first mover advantage, I

223
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
suppose, in AI, Ergo AI tooling,
sustainable pricing model. We do charge a

224
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
little bit more just in terms of the token
usage out of the box, but I think most AI

225
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
providers do that. And then we have a
clear path to trading AI agents.

226
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't have any questions, do you?

227
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
No, man. I'll go ask CodeUTXO.

228
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Okay, perfect. Yeah, good idea.

229
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Sweet. So here's our actual front page to
get started. So just the gist, we can get

230
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
started through here, put in an address,
you can buy some credits, it'll take you

231
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
to our credits page. You can view your
usage into the accounts. Of course you

232
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
need to sign in.

233
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And so just run through, there's our
website. Just like CannonQ talked about,

234
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
we have GPT 4.0. Here's the pricing. And
then here's some sample usage costs. And

235
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
then here's our token packs. So we can do
the small pack.

236
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So we can see it's about 1.1 ERGs, and
then we apply a 10% markup for tokens. So

237
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
SigmaRSV, SigmaUSD, and then we do a 20%
markup for Quacks, Comet, and if you don't

238
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
see a token that we have on here and you'd
like it, just let us know, we can think

239
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
about it.

240
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Click these buttons, we can see, so
pretty much 100 to 1,000 and then 3,000.

241
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And then this will change live. And so
basically you wanna, yeah, go ahead.

242
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah, so the tokens, the reason why there
is a cost lift between just paying in ERG

243
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and paying in anything else is basically
we're swapping it back to ERG. We're

244
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
taking best practices we've seen from
other projects, namely, honestly, Quacks,

245
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
right?

246
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
When they do arrays, they're swapping it
back to SigmaUSD right then. They're

247
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
raising ERG or they're raising ADA and
they're swapping it. And so that's

248
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
basically so that we have costs on the
backend that we got to cover.

249
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So some of those other tokens have higher
slippage, things like that. We're just

250
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
trying to make it available if you have a
bag of it and that's what you want to use

251
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and not use your precious ERG. That's
great. But there's a little bit more

252
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
volatility with some of those smaller
community tokens.

253
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Absolutely. So we'll go walk through
getting started. We're going to sign up,

254
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:57,000
put in your Ergo address, demo user,
create an account and so we see you have

255
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:07,000
0.25 credits so we give everybody this
amount.

256
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Please don't go overboard in using a
bunch of different wallets for free

257
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
credits, otherwise we might have to
replace that.

258
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Daygens are gonna daygen, man.

259
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah, right, right.

260
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Sweet, so here's our token page, or I'm
sorry, our account page, so you can know

261
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
your user, your wallet address that's
connected, how many credits you spent, how

262
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
many credits you actually have.

263
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Then we can actually go to the buy
credits page, we'll connect the wallet.

264
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Now my wallet's actually connected to a
different one at the moment. Let me

265
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
refresh here. Sweet, we're connected.

266
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And then from here we can just pick
whatever asset you'd like to use. So ERG,

267
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
SigmaRSV, etc. We'll click ERG. I'm going
to buy a hundred credits and I don't think

268
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
it'll pop up on here. It'll be off screen,
probably on the recording.

269
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Okay, so here we go. So as you can see,
1.1 is leaving the wallet. This is going

270
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
to our wallet, the network fee, sign it
and go from there. So it'll pop back.

271
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And so basically what happens once you
sign it, it'll run in the server will wait

272
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
to see that's confirmed. And then once it
confirms, we'll pop back here, you can

273
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
sync with that. And then it'll say, Hey,
you just bought 100 credits, you'll have

274
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
100 credits, and then how we translate
that back into our system. We'll do that.

275
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And then from here, we can then navigate
to the OpenWebUI portal. And you should

276
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
just have the GPT 4.0. But I'm gonna
actually show off the Sigma bot real

277
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
quick. I don't think we have this native
to our general users, but this is what I

278
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
was talking about with the code base.

279
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And so we can say, what is the pros and
cons of ErgoScript? I haven't asked this

280
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:18,000
question before, so we'll see.

281
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And so we can see it's searching the
knowledge base. So all those documents

282
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
that I have, I'll have to make a GitHub
repo or something like that and come up

283
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
with like sub modules so then it just
pulls them. But basically what I did was I

284
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
grabbed all the different, and I spelled
this wrong, but it knows what we're

285
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
talking about here.

286
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I got rid of all the different files that
we don't really need. So like build files

287
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and things like that.

288
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Sweet. So we can see here's the summary.
So that's pretty nice, advanced scripting

289
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
language and we can actually see what file
it came back with 88% relevancy. So from

290
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
an AI perspective, obviously that is
important.

291
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And this is actually where it got it
from. It got to 88%, so efficient

292
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
consensus, low fees. As we know, if you
build or trade or send TXs right, we know

293
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
our fees are pretty low.

294
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Scalable, fast transactions, well, sort
of. Two minutes is sometimes can extend,

295
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
yeah, so.

296
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
That's why we didn't do the payments. No
shade to anybody, but if we do the

297
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
payments while we're recording, we know
we'll hit that 12 minute block.

298
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Right, exactly, exactly. So smaller
ecosystems, certainly true. Ongoing

299
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
development, yeah, obviously, but I think
that's not necessarily a con here.

300
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I don't know, what's a question that you
have for the Sigma Bot CannonQ?

301
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Is this the one where we can actually ask
it, like show an example of code and

302
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
things of that nature, or is this more the
ecosystem, different that we have?

303
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It's got all of that in it.

304
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:24,000
How about ask it about demurrage?

305
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So searching through, and then while
that's loading, you can see here. So we

306
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
have 985 for completion tokens. The prompt
token is 1306. So completion tokens, I

307
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
believe, are output tokens. 1306 is the
input tokens, and then total tokens is

308
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
2291.

309
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So demurrage is storage rent. It is like
a small fee you pay if you're holding onto

310
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
your box of money on the Ergo blockchain
for a very long time, specifically after

311
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
it sits there untouched for four years.
Think of it like having a piggy bank where

312
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
after four years you need to put a little
bit money to keep it.

313
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
In Ergo, this fee is usually about 0.14
for a simple box of money every four

314
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
years. This helps keep people from putting
their money on the blockchain and never

315
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
touching again and making sure the network
stays healthy.

316
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Nice.

317
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And then, yeah, here we go. rent.md. And
then if you wanted to, right, you can just

318
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
open this up and open up, well, you can't
see it, but open up the markdown file. And

319
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
so that's the SigmaBot. And that's coming.

320
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You will not see that today, but you'll
see that hopefully in the next week or

321
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
two.

322
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Yes, sir. Let me go. So now we'll do...
We got a bunch of different for us in

323
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
here.

324
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Okay, cool, so we got, so we can see Ergo
Explorer, so that's the Ergo MCP, and then

325
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
we have the Ergo Price MCP. So we'll start
with Ergo MCP, or the Price MCP.

326
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So let's say, what is the price of Ergo
from the last 10 days, and can you, okay,

327
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:06,000
that's fine. And then I'm gonna click this
code interpreter.

328
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So the code interpreter basically allows
to take that input and this will rather

329
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
the MCP grabs that input for the LLM it
processes it and then it allows it to

330
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
output relative to that context and then
from there with the code interpreter it

331
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
can then take that data and then plot it
for us like we see here.

332
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So now we see this price data. It looks
pretty accurate from what I can tell.

333
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
So let's do, can you make this plot bar
chart and add a moving average? I'm not

334
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
sure if it can do this. I was trying this
the other day with trying to add Heiken

335
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Ashi candles and it didn't have a library.
So I think there's probably something on

336
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
our end. We just need to install that
library and then it can be able to have

337
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
that functionality.

338
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
But looks like it's analyzing it, so it
shouldn't be a problem. Sweet. So there

339
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
you go. There's your moving average. And
so we could probably extend this to look

340
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
at it for the last year, add some various
moving averages.

341
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And so now you can sort of, instead of
looking through TradingView or something

342
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
like that, you could easily just use our
tool, query it, grab the data that you're

343
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
looking for, try to see if you're bullish
or bearish relative to Ergo, but also we

344
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
can look at specific tokens.

345
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So let's grab our Rosen. Let's start with
something simple. And so for right now, we

346
00:30:45,000 --> 00:31:03,000
have to use token IDs for this. It doesn't
natively know token name to token ID.

347
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Price of Rosen, it's been quite stable.
Well, thank you for the last 10 days.

348
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I think there might be some nuances with
this, just in how crux does it, but let's

349
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
see. And then while that's cooking, I'm
going to do, okay, cool, fantastic.

350
00:31:33,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Now let's do two things. Let's...

351
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So basically what I'm asking him to do is
plot those two tokens, Ergo and Rosen, and

352
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
then basically have the lines sort of
match up. So you have a y-axis for Ergo,

353
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
you have a y-axis for Rosen.

354
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Yeah, and this is a good time to say this
is... Oh, okay, so... Yeah.

355
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Well, that's good to tease out. So it
looks like, right. And this makes sense.

356
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yeah. But relative, it's like, yeah, this
kind of do be expected.

357
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
But again, so this is something that
like, hey, if this is really something you

358
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
guys want, we can add more tools and
functionality to more, I like to think of

359
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
like an MCP is sort of like, in data in
particular, like a cloth and the more you

360
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
squeeze it, the more data comes out and
stretch it and move it in different

361
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
directions. And so that's what we need to
do here.

362
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Sorry, I cut you off. What were you gonna
say, CannonQ?

363
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
No, I was just going to say it's the
prompts, right? So like when we were

364
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
testing this, I asked it, I forget what
the question was, but it gave me like a

365
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
real cheeky response. Like the first 10
wallets and it gave me all the details and

366
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I said, well, give me all 50.

367
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And it's like, well, here's the first 10
and the next one, yada, yada, yada,

368
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
basically. And then qx() asked it the same
question, but just changed it slightly and

369
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
it gave them all the details.

370
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So, anyone who's used LLMs, I mean, you
get that. What would be great is here, if

371
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
you let us know or let the community know,
here's the best prompt for me trying to

372
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
get this information. It took me a little
bit, but here's how I did it. Here's the

373
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
best way to do it because his and mine
looked identical but for a few words and

374
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
it made all the difference.

375
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Yeah, and that's actually a feature with
OpenWebUI. We can create prompts, and then

376
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
all you have to do is like this, and then
plot, and then run the variables and

377
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
stuff. We just haven't done that,
obviously.

378
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
So here I'm asking it, I'm not sure, we
haven't done this type of one before, but

379
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
plot the holders of the token. So I'm
asking it like two separate things. So

380
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
grab all the holders of Rosen and then
plot those. So testing it, see what it can

381
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
do.

382
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And really a lot of these use cases are
really, certainly not developer focused at

383
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,000
the moment, but really just sort of like a
learning sort of get the ideas pumping

384
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah. And I mean, that's the, I mean,
it's a hack, right? We had a week, and I

385
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
think people are going to see just from
this the power of it. We have great tools

386
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,000
in the community, but sometimes you have
to be a power user to get them to work or

387
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,000
to massage it further. And that's what
we're hoping this will do for you.

388
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:33,000
That's fine, didn't give it to me. Here,
let me try this.

389
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yeah, I was doing some cool analysis like
this the other day. And then I was

390
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
identifying myself like, hey, here's,
that's a DEX. Number two is a DEX

391
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
contract. Number three is a team wallet.
Now reanalyze this without those two. Like

392
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
what percent are those and what's leftover
for general holders, that kind of thing.

393
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
There's some good, I don't know if you
want to call it money flow, but economic

394
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
flow through tokens that you can do with
this that I can't figure out how to do it

395
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
anywhere else.

396
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Yeah, I mean you can scour the Ergo
Explorer and just go from one to one to

397
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
one, but it just takes a long time. And so
if you have this process that you can

398
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,000
define, right, then that's what the MCP
server is. And then it's just a matter of

399
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,000
flowing the data into it.

400
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I believe this is Rosen.

401
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah, so I did that one. It's a funny one
because there's the various team wallets

402
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
and hot wallets and cold wallets, all the
different spots that it is.

403
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yeah, so this is a great research tool.
It's like, hey, should I buy this token?

404
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
All right, well, let me look at the
tokenomics. Let me, of what the team says.

405
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
All right, well, actually, let me see what
actually on chain says.

406
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
CannonQ, you said, you would really like
a tool for liquidity, inflow and outflow,

407
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
how many transactions per day. And there
are some tools that do that, like, I

408
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
think, like, I think Crux shows that or
something like that, or, but in any case,

409
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
or maybe MewFinance has that now.

410
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Well, one of the things I was curious
about, we launched the trading, I'm sorry,

411
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
the trading, the mining DAO released PFT,
right, the recycled token. It'd be cool to

412
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
look at the LP in there and understand
what's happening.

413
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:46,000
There's a big unlock coming in another
month, what's not locked, how many holders

414
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,000
don't own the locked portion, that kind of
thing. And that's sort of hard to see

415
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:00,000
anywhere without a ton of know-how.

416
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Like a normal person can't just walk up
and go, oh, I can trade it on a DEX, but

417
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
how many people are making up this
liquidity pool that I'm trading with? You

418
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
may want to know. It may be five wallets.
It may be the same five wallets are on

419
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
every token. You can do some cool stuff.

420
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:32,000
All right. Well, while that's loading,
let me load up something else. I'm going

421
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:46,000
to get the latest big transaction. This
plotting is really taking its time.

422
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Again, I'm going to have to cut this
short here in about five or three.

423
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
All right, cool. So here's this
transaction. It's got the inputs. It's got

424
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
the outputs.

425
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Oh, nice.

426
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Got a lot of ERG 33,000. And then we can
come here real quick. This is the actual,

427
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
and then we see 33,000, the various box
IDs. And you can do the same for box IDs.

428
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You can do address balances.

429
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So let me just do one last thing.

430
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Now, I probably wouldn't suggest this
because you just look at an explorer,

431
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
right? Pay to look this information up.
But in any case, here you go. This is my

432
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Tipper wallet. So you get to see 14 ERG,
all these different tokens. So yeah.

433
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So yeah, I mean, again, if you want an
MCP server, let us know. Happy to make it

434
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
probably. Or if you want to join up, let
us know. That would be fantastic.

435
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And I think a lot of these tools are very
curated for a lot of specific tasks. And

436
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
so we can have a lot of different agents
doing specific things, because a lot of

437
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
this is very complex. And so we can then
functionalize it, put it into an MCP

438
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
server, and then abstract that and put
that into the hands of something more

439
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
autonomous and then run in the background
for us doing whatever you'd like, maybe

440
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
forensic analysis, trading, grabbing
information, etc.

441
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Right. And just the last thing I'll close
with is it's called CodeUTXO. We hid the

442
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,000
eUTXO in there, right, at the end of the
code. But we're hoping to apply this to

443
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
other UTXO chains.

444
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So, I mean, it's... Hopefully someone
sees this presentation that's not part of

445
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
the Ergo community or they're involved in
other UTXO chains. We'd love to start

446
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
figuring out how to apply those, but we
have, from some of our research we've

447
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
already started, not everyone's nodes are
as easy as Ergo's to run, I'll tell you

448
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
that right there.

449
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Yeah, or just space-wise.

450
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Yeah, for sure. We've been having to kick
some bricks trying to get them to reboot.

451
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
But yeah, it's Marc, me, qx(). qx() is
the unsung hero here since he's not here.

452
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And he's done a yeoman's job here, just an
amazing amount of work on the back end,

453
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
getting everything to talk and chatter
with each other.

454
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
But hope you guys liked the presentation.
We really enjoyed building this. Me

455
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
watching it more than building it and
throwing grenades. Hey, can we do this?

456
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Can we do it that way? And Marc going,
yeah, qx() going.

457
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Damn it. Finding good edge cases, that's
for sure.

458
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Yeah. Good feedback. It's been a fun
project. And I think you guys can tell

459
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
from our querying, probably less in the
presentation, more in the querying and

460
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
just talking about it when we're getting
to use it. I mean, it's an awesome tool

461
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
and we're looking really forward to
everyone jumping in, getting a few credits

462
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and making this better.

463
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
We're open for feedback. We're not an
ivory tower on this one. We want everyone

464
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
to be on the ground floor with it.

465
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
So absolutely. And with that, I will say
again, the MCP servers are open source. So

466
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
if you have a cloud subscription, you just
need to take that into your cloud desktop

467
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
and port that over and then you're off to
the races.

468
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Same thing with cursor. So obviously,
maybe use our platform. But again, if you

469
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
don't want to, you can look, hook it up
with OpenWebUI yourself, hook up your own

470
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,000
MCP servers in there, and there's so many
different platforms you can use this, so.

471
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Yeah, thanks guys so much. Alright, cool.
Alright, see you everybody. Thanks.

472
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Alright, peace.
