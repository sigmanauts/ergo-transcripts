1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Thanks for joining.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Today we will explore Game of Proms, or
GOP.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The main idea is summarized by our
slogan, AI challenges, blockchain

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
solutions.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
GOP is a new platform designed to help AI
development become more open and

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
collaborative.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's built on top of two technologies,
Celaut, that is a system ensuring that

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
services are unchangeable, immutable, and
run in a safe, separate, isolated spaces,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
which is vital for fair and trustworthy
competitions.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and the Ergo blockchain, which provides a
transparent system for rewards and

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
verifying results when training and
testing AI models.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Celaut can also be used to execute
services in a distributed manner, where

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the interaction of processes is occurring
in Ergo, but this property is not relevant

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
here in GOP.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So today we use AI more and more, but its
development is often centralized.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This can limit broad participation, make
it hard to see how things work, and hinder

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
collaborative efforts.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
How can this be improved?

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
How can more people globally contribute
to solving complex AI problems and

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
building better AI?

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
These are the motivations behind Game of
Proms.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So the main idea is to make AI
development more like an open competitive

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
sport.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The system runs as follows.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
First, creators can define specific AI
problems or challenges as game services.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
For example, a creator could design an AI
challenge for the game Snake.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And the game's service will be the snake
game itself, its rules, and how it

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
measures the AI's score, like the snake
length.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
These game services provide the
environment, any necessary data, and

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
clear, objective ways to measure AI
performance.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Then a global community of developers and
AI enthusiasts can then create and submit

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
their solver services for the Snake
example.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This would be their AI designed to play
Snake.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So these solver services run inside the
game service.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Celaut ensures that this happens in a way
that is safe and isolated, protecting both

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the game and the solver.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We will see this later in the demo.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And finally, the scores, performance
data, and prize distributions are all

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
managed transparently and fairly on the
Ergo blockchain.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So GOP aims to get more diverse solutions
by opening up challenges to everyone.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It makes building and testing AI models
more distributed, transparent and

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
accessible.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So this platform isn't just about simple
games.

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's about building a framework to
improve AI collaboratively with incentives

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
for innovation.

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Let's look at the key components.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So first, the game service.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Think of this as the AI benchmark or the
controller test environment.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's a Celaut service.

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This means it's packaged so it cannot be
changed.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's immutable once it's defined by the
creator.

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and it runs in its own safe, separate
space, so it's isolated.

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is vital so everyone can trust the
test environment and its fate exactly how

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
the creator specified it.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And it defines the problem that provides
the context and includes the logic to

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
evaluate any submitted AI model, any
solution.

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Probably it will be executed by the
participants on its own local nodes.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And it's capable to do that.

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Second, the solver service.

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is the model or algorithm created by
a participant.

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's also a service.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So it's also immutable and runs in
isolation.

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This ensures the game service can trust
the solver hasn't been tampered with.

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And the solver is protected from
excessive interference during the

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
execution.

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's their proposed solution ready for
evaluation.

68
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Then the GopWeb portal.

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This acts as the central hub.

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Creators can publish their AI challenges
here, and developers can find these

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
challenges to download game services and
later submit their results for on-chain

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
validation.

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And it can be as a local service or not.

74
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And finally, the Ergo blockchain.

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This serves as the highly secure and
transparent ledger.

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's used for registering AI challenges,
tracking participation, cryptographically

77
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
validating AI model performance, and
distributing the rewards fairly.

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This structure, particularly with Celaut
immutability and isolation, ensures a

79
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
trusted execution environment, allowing
complex AI tasks to be broken down into

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
verifiable and competitive challenges.

81
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
OK, so let's see what creators and
players do.

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
A creator who designs an AI challenge.

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
First, they design the game or a test.

84
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It needs a score that can be measured.

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's also very important that the game
has a variety or changes each time it's

86
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
played.

87
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This stops players from just finding one
fixed answer for a game that never

88
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
changes.

89
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Then they generate a unique secret code
for their game.

90
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This code is a key for securely verifying
scores on the blockchain later.

91
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Then they package their game as a service
with the inside, with the secret inside,

92
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
make the service unchangeable.

93
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And finally, they publish it, they
publish the service.

94
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This involves creating a game box on the
Ergo blockchain, which stores hash of

95
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
their secret code, the competition
deadline, the participation fee, and the

96
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
game service hash and other parameters.

97
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And on the player side, the player is who
builds an AI solution for that challenge,

98
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
for that game.

99
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So the player first finds a game or
challenge on the GOP web portal and

100
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
downloads the selected game service.

101
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The download can be done across the
Celaut node if it's available in some

102
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:25,000
peers or in a centralized repository like
Mega or Google Drive or something.

103
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Then they can design their solver service

104
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
their AI model or strategy.

105
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:49,000
package the solution as an unchangeable
Celaut service.

106
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Then they run the game service with a
solver on their own Celaut node.

107
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Because they are Celaut services, they
run in their own separate safe spaces,

108
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
ensuring a fair test.

109
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
When it finishes, they get their
performance data, a cryptographic

110
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
commitment, a list of scores, the real
score is hidden among these, and a hash of

111
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
the game logs.

112
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And if they are satisfied with their AI's
performance, with the score, they submit

113
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
their entry to compete into the
blockchain.

114
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They do this by creating a participation
box on the Ergo blockchain and paying the

115
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
entry fee.

116
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Now how are scores kept secret during the
competition but still proven to be correct

117
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and fair at the end.

118
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This is done using these commitments on
Ergo.

119
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So let's explain it.

120
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
First, when a player tests

121
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
the game locally, the game service, which
knows the game secret, the game secret is

122
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
inside of the game service, generates a
commitment.

123
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
This commitment is a special hash code,
like a digital fingerprint.

124
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's made from the solver ID, the real
score, the log hash,

125
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:47,000
the game record code and a secret game.

126
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The player submits this commitment and a
score list, the real score plus some

127
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
decoys.

128
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:06,000
to the blockchain, we use a list of
scores because publishing the exact score

129
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
directly could discourage later players
from submitting their own items unless

130
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
they were certain they could beat all the
current scores on the blockchain.

131
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
With this way, their actual score isn't
public yet, but it's on the blockchain.

132
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So after the game's deadline, the creator
reveals the secret code.

133
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And then the Ergo smart contract, the
script on the game box, does the

134
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
verification for every participant.

135
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It uses a valid secret, their solver ID,
their log hash, and tries each score in

136
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,000
their score list to calculate the
commitment.

137
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,000
If this commitment matches the real
committed commitment in the participation

138
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:22,000
box, the player originally submitted, that
score is confirmed as the true and

139
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
validated score for that AI model, for
that solver.

140
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Then the contract automatically
identifies the participation with the

141
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
highest validated score and that player
wins.

142
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
This entire process is transparent,
verifiable by anyone and enforced by the

143
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
blockchain code.

144
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Okay, enough talk.

145
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Let's see how the system works.

146
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So first of all, we need to install the
Celaut node.

147
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So let's go to the node github page.

148
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's an alpha version, so this is
important.

149
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's actually an alpha version, it's
recommended to use a virtual machine.

150
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm not going to use a virtual machine,
but it's recommended.

151
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So first we install this.

152
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
OK, so the node is installed.

153
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's check info.

154
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
OK, the key up.

155
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yes.

156
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And we can see this is the address of
this node, the conversion.

157
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And it's connected to an Ergo node.

158
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
was created two wallets, two Ergo
wallets.

159
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You can check how it works on the node
documentation, but actually it's data

160
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
doesn't have ERGs.

161
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But this is not important for Game of
Proms.

162
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So first of all, we need to implement our
game service.

163
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
We have implemented it, but it's

164
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's in games.

165
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
This is our folder with the game service.

166
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So it contains all the logic to make the
score, commits, and all of this to manage

167
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
the solvers.

168
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So inside of the code, this is the secret
that we should previously generate

169
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So we are going to use this secret to
submit the game service.

170
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
First of all, we need to pack it into a
service.

171
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So for that, we need to do node pack.

172
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And wait, because this could take like 20
minutes maybe.

173
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So I'm going to break the video here.

174
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Okay, so the service game package process
is finished.

175
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So we have the service on our Celaut
node.

176
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:01,000
We can check it with this command or we
can inspect it.

177
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
this other command.

178
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Here we see all the information about
this service, the metadata that these

179
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
hashes, the hash of the service, the hash
of all of this content, and the reputation

180
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
proofs of the service that are

181
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
on Ergo, but this currently doesn't have
anyone.

182
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And here we see that the service can't
connect to outside sources.

183
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So it can't submit information to other
servers or something.

184
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So it's for privacy or things like that.

185
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So now let's, as game creators, we are
going to... We are going to submit our

186
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:04,000
game to the Ergo blockchain.

187
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So we will need...

188
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Okay, well, this is not the browser, is
this?

189
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Perfect.

190
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Okay, so here we see the games and we are
going to create a new game.

191
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Snake demo video.

192
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The game service is this.

193
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We should add the type of the hash, maybe
here.

194
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And our game secret that is in the code,
internally in the game service.

195
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So the participants can't see it because
it's obfuscated.

196
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Actually, it's not obfuscated, but it
should be.

197
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:28,000
participation fee, we are going to put
the minimum and two hours maybe.

198
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The game creator will receive 20% of the
total amount that is accumulated in the

199
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
contract.

200
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:48,000
We can put a link and snake

201
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and use an image and this should be like
the URL where the user can download the

202
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:06,000
service game if his Celaut node can't take
it from other peers.

203
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So create a game.

204
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Okay, sign the transaction.

205
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
OK, so the transaction is done.

206
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So here we have the game.

207
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
This is the time to the deadline.

208
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And I can submit my score.

209
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
This is the same wallet that created the
game, but could work too.

210
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So here we have the NFT of the game, the
token that identifies the game, me, the

211
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
creator.

212
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
This is the service game, the game
service.

213
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
A link with more information, the
participation fee, the creator commission,

214
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
the stake that the creator puts on the
contract to ensure that he will resolve it

215
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
at the end after the deadline.

216
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And some URLs, a list of URLs that a
participant could use.

217
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
to get a game service if the Celaut
network can't provide it.

218
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Because maybe it doesn't have any peers
with this service.

219
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
This could be a centralized service
provider or like Mega or Google Drive or

220
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
something, or IPFS or other centralized
solution.

221
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So let's play now the role of

222
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
the role of developers.

223
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So now, as developers, we want to
participate in this game.

224
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So we need to implement our solution that
is here.

225
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
There are two solvers, but actually we
are going to use the basic solver that is

226
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
a very basic AI algorithm with A-star.

227
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It's very short.

228
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So the other one, it's a language model
solver that creates a prompt to control

229
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
the snake.

230
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But we are going to pack this.

231
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So for this, we need to do the same.

232
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And this could take 20 minutes too, maybe
less, but we need to wait.

233
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Well, our basic AI snake, our robot to
play snake, it's packed, actually.

234
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
here, you can see.

235
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So pack means that we transform from the
source code to a service, OK, specifying

236
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
the Dockerfile to create all the file
system, specifying the interface of the

237
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
service,

238
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and these things.

239
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You can read more about it on the Celaut
Project repositories.

240
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So now we need to play the Snake game.

241
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:59,000
we need to execute locally or in one of
our peers, the snake game.

242
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:08,000
We have it actually on our node, but if
we downloaded it from a mirror URLs, we

243
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:17,000
should make this command import, like for
example, snake game, that would be,

244
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and it should be imported to the node
repository.

245
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Well, the node registry of service.

246
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So actually we have one peer, I think,
that it's running in another computer of

247
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
my local network.

248
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So we don't have ads.

249
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
This is the information of this node.

250
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm talking very much about this, but
each node has its own Ergo wallet.

251
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So they transfer ERG one to each other
for rent gas, where gas is the

252
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
representation of resources of a node.

253
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But yes, actually, they give to each peer
a default amount of gas free.

254
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So they don't need to transfer ERG.

255
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Okay, so let's execute the service game.

256
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So here, the node has decided to run the

257
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
execute the snake's game on the other
peer, but if this peer doesn't have the

258
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
snake game service, so it will take from
this node then, but it's running on our

259
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
computer.

260
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
We can read it here.

261
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
This is the instance ID.

262
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The service is the snake game.

263
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And the parent is the client that
represents all the execution from the

264
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
terminal.

265
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And the gas that has this instance.

266
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So we can access to this.

267
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So the Snake game, it's hosting a simple
webpage to control it.

268
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
That allows you to play games, to play
participations with your solvers, and to

269
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
reproduce

270
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
solvers from other participants.

271
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
If they share their solver logs of the
game and seed, game seed to allow

272
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
deterministic reproduction.

273
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So we need to get our solver with a
Celaut service extension.

274
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So we need to, for that, we need to
export it.

275
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Export, what's the name?

276
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Sorry.

277
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So we export the basic AI snake.

278
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Actually, we have this on the desktop, so
we can run the game.

279
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
We load it on the game service and start
the game.

280
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So actually, the game service is
receiving the solver in a file using a

281
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
library that allows the service to
interact with its node.

282
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,000
The game service will be able to request
the execution of the solver to the node

283
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
that is executing it.

284
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,000
If you are interested in how Celaut works
or how Celaut manages services or things

285
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,000
like that, you can check the demo videos
that are on the Celaut repository.

286
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,000
It has the repository.

287
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Okay, so we can see actually that the
game service has sent the solver to the

288
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:04,000
node.

289
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The node is building it.

290
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Building it means that it's taking all
the file system and creating a virtual

291
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
machine for that service.

292
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But this is only needed at the first
execution of a service in a node.

293
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay, so actually the node, it's running
actually the solver.

294
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So we can check these.

295
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Checking other instances.

296
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So actually, both services, the game
service and the solver, are running on the

297
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
local node.

298
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
This can be seen here in location.

299
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:07,000
But if the other peer of my network takes
the execution here, where my node says,

300
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:15,000
okay, where I should execute this.

301
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And it's only considering itself because
the other peer doesn't have the service.

302
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And as we can see here,

303
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
The game, the snake game, the game
service loses some gas, spent some gas to

304
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
execute.

305
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Our solver has dependency.

306
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And yes, so this game snake game, the
game service, it's controlling, it's

307
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
executing the solver service.

308
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So here we can see the progress.

309
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So for each time, the game service sends
the state of the snake,

310
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and the environment to the solver and the
solver returns a position like up, down,

311
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
and so on.

312
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
This time was only length three.

313
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It's a low score, but it's valid.

314
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And this is the seed of this game.

315
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
We need these two.

316
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
to allow reproduction for other
participants to check our solver if they

317
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
want.

318
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Here, now we need to download this
participation data.

319
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
We could replay it more times.

320
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
This solver can get to a 50 score or
things like that, but we are going to

321
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
participate with this.

322
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So here we need to...

323
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,000
to download the data packet so this
contains all the information that we need

324
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,000
to add to the Ergo blockchain it contains
the solver ID our solver ID that is this

325
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,000
the hash logs that basically add all the
logs this log file that is here this

326
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:32,000
contains all the information about the

327
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
The game?

328
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
This is the commitment that contains
internally the secret, just the game

329
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
secret that only the game creator knows.

330
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And this is a score list where this is
one of them, it's all real one.

331
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And these other, actually, these
parameters are not going to be loaded to

332
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
the Ergo blockchain.

333
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
They should be in other versions of the
protocol.

334
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:19,000
this is the seed that reproduces the game
and determinism index says to the others

335
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:28,000
how many times you need to reproduce the
solver

336
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
to get the same logs.

337
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
So for this example, for this solver,
it's very deterministic.

338
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But if it's a language model, for
example, solver, probably it needs a more

339
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
high index.

340
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Maybe.

341
00:33:49,000 --> 00:34:01,000
modify these scores if we want, but it
must contain the real score because if not

342
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:13,000
contain the real score, the contract will
not add our participation on the code.

343
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So, okay, we can download this and we are
ready to participate, to submit a

344
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
participation with this data.

345
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:51,000
so okay 30 minutes only i have made i
have repeated some parts of the video so

346
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Okay, submit my score, so I can put all
the input forms manually or submit a JSON

347
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
file.

348
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Downloads, yes, this.

349
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So here is the commitment code that
contains the service, the service secret,

350
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:20,000
the hash logs, the hash of the logs, the
service ID, the real score.

351
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
This is the solver ID, hash logs, yes,
hash logs, and scores, where this is all

352
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
real, but other participants will not
know.

353
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Confirm.

354
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And we need to wait now to this.

355
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So we can reproduce if we want the logs.

356
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Here, yes, this.

357
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Play, and we can reproduce our game, for
example.

358
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Or we can play another time, if we want.

359
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
OK, so the transaction is confirmed.

360
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:42,000
So participation was submitted.

361
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:50,000
OK, there's one participation and there
are 22 minutes left.

362
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
OK, so this is our participation.

363
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
We can see the score list, but the
reality is encrypted.

364
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And there are this amount of ERGs to the
prize.

365
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So we are going to stop the video and
resolve the game after the deadline.

366
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Well, so after the deadline, the
participation is closed.

367
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So now the participants need to wait that
the game creator resolve the game.

368
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Because for resolve the game, the game
secret is needed into an output of the

369
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
transaction.

370
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
of the transaction that will spend the
game box and all the participation boxes.

371
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So, as the role of game developers, the
game creators, are going to take the

372
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
secret that is inside of the game service,
we are going to resolve the game.

373
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:11,000
So this transaction, the script of this
transaction will loop all the

374
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:18,000
participations and all the scores of each
participation and select the correct score

375
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,000
for each participation and will allow send
the prize to the participant with the

376
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,000
highest score.

377
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:46,000
The transaction is done.

378
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
It's completed.

379
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
We can see now that the game was
resolved.

380
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
This wallet is the unique participation.

381
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
is the winner.

382
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So we received the transaction with the
ERG.

383
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And yes, and we can see here the real
scores of each participant.

384
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And that's it.

385
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
That's it.

386
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So why

387
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Why is Game of Proms good for making AI
better in the future?

388
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Well, it ensures fair and trustworthy AI
tests.

389
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
The rules are code.

390
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
A model performance is only openly
validated and prizes are given out by

391
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
smart contracts on Ergo.

392
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Unchangeable and isolated services are

393
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,000
are okay for this trust, so everyone
knows the game and the AI players are

394
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,000
running exactly as intended without hidden
modifications.

395
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It rewards innovation when prizes are
given for the best AI models.

396
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It encourages people to try new
approaches and find breakthrough solutions

397
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
to AI problems.

398
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It fosters decentralized collaborations
and provides the trust layer for results

399
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
on payments.

400
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So GOP can help break down traditional
silos where AI work might be stuck with

401
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
one group or in one place.

402
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It opens new kinds of challenges.

403
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
The platform can host competitions for AI
models in many advanced areas like

404
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
algorithmic trading in simulated markets
or scientific discovery like

405
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:54,000
like protein folding, for example, or
complex resource management problems,

406
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:02,000
like, for example, energy optimization on
installations.

407
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,000
There are a lot of challenges that can be
done.

408
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
It empowers both creators and developers.

409
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Creators can design and monetize unique
challenges, and developers get a platform

410
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
to test their skills, gain recognition,
and potentially earn rewards from their

411
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
innovative AI models.

412
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Then the AI models that are

413
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
shared between the community are open not
not source open maybe could be but not

414
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
necessarily but they are on

415
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:52,000
are isolated pieces of software so anyone
can use in its own local computers or

416
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:00,000
other computers but without the censorship
resistant of other AI solutions where are

417
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:08,000
hosted only on the developers' servers.

418
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
So as we say in the last slide, the snake
demo is just the start, because Game of

419
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Proms is designed for a much wider range
of AI applications.

420
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I'm going to mention some of them.

421
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
learning to navigate and control things
like a more advanced version of Snake Game

422
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
or Pac-Man or other retro games or that
can be to a simulated robots in complex

423
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
environments, complex and simulated
environments.

424
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And then these same solvers can be
executed in real robots in the real world,

425
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
for example, and algorithmic trading bots
where AI agents compete to achieve the

426
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
best returns in simulated financial
markets.

427
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:07,000
There is an example of trading game
implementation on the code base too.

428
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
We could have scientific discovery, AI
challenges for tasks like protein folding

429
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
or discovering novel material properties.

430
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
AI for strategic planning or resources
optimization, games that test an AI's

431
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
long-term decision-making.

432
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
AI for making or fixing computer code,
where AI writes or optimizes software, if

433
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
the rules of these challenges are well
specified.

434
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And natural language processing task,
where AI are scored on their ability to

435
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
understand, interpret or generate human
language.

436
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,000
That is the trending topic, actually, in
AI.

437
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So if an AI's performance on a task can
be quantifiably scored, and if its

438
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
environment can be built as a third-party
game service, it can be a Game of Proms

439
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
challenge.

440
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
OK, so vision and future plans.

441
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So the first version was built for
ErgoHack.

442
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:23,000
The first version was built for ErgoHack,
showcasing the main idea.

443
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Looking ahead, the vision of GOP is to
make it a significant platform for

444
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
advancing in AI in a new open and
trustworthy way.

445
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,000
So for that, I'm going to enumerate some
points.

446
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
that could be necessary or important.

447
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
With the community, the aim is to attract
AI researchers, developers, and

448
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
organizations to both create compelling
challenges and zoom into innovative AI

449
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
solutions.

450
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Develop advanced game mechanisms and AI
evaluation metrics so the platform can

451
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
support increasingly complex AI tasks.

452
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
provide better tools to simplify the
creation, testing, and deployment of game

453
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
and solver instances.

454
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:21,000
This is more a task for the Celaut part,
so the Celaut layer, maybe.

455
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and explore possibilities like
multi-chain support and integrations with

456
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
other AI platforms to expand reach and
impact.

457
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Particularly the multi-chain support can
be, it's more detailed on the

458
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
documentation of the ErgoHack proposal.

459
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
You can read it if you want.

460
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:52,000
So basically, this opens a big
opportunity for a worldwide incentivized

461
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:59,000
and transparent platform for finally
making and testing AI models.

462
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So that's Game of Proms, AI challenges,
blockchain solutions.

463
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It's a platform designed for people to
compete, collaborate, and advance AI in an

464
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
open, distributed, and trustworthy manner.

465
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So thank you for listening, and I'm happy
to answer

466
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Any questions on Discord, Telegram or the
YouTube comments of this video?

467
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So, thanks.
