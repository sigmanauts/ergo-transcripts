1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Mark, what's happening, man?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hey, Tim.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Good, man. Good. Warm and sunny in
Florida. How about you?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Dude, it's cold over here. It was, I
think, in the 20s this morning when I woke

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
up. But you know what is heating up,
though?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, the bull run, right?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh, dude, I gotta say, the other day, I
saw that dumb bird just like going up and

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I was the worst employee. I checked my
phone like 30 times, I swear to God. I was

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
like, holy shit, 90,000.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What a great Monday, you know, it's just
like, geez, and then I see people on

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Twitter. It's like, okay, we don't have to
post every $1,000. You know, it's starting

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
to get like that. It's exciting. You know,
it's just like, oh, man, you know, texting

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
the normie friends like guys, it's
happening, you know, the conviction. Yeah,

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
we have it's finally, you know, it's
bearing fruit in some sense, right?

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, dude, I gotta say, when Bitcoin was
down, I told 50 to 100 people, like for

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
sure, at least that many. I even did a
presentation in my doctoral program

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
because we had this assignment where it
was for an evaluation class, like how to

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
structure formal evaluations. And so my
like little side project or like mini

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
project for this class was is Bitcoin a
scam? And so I like conducted a formal

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
evaluation. And clearly, it's not a scam.
I don't know if it's going to be the

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
reserve currency of the world, but it's
not a scam. And so I gave this whole

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
presentation. Everyone was like, didn't it
just crash? I'm like, yeah, that's why I

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
told you about it right now. I told all
these people, probably 100 people in that

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
class and otherwise, the only person that
listened to me was my mom. My mom bought.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
My mom bought Bitcoin and is now like,
yeah.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's awesome. Yeah, good for her. So
how did you convince your mom? I feel like

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
my parents, at least my dad, he's like,
you know, I should have bought it or like,

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you know, but then doesn't get the go
ahead, I guess, you know, what was your

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
argument, I guess, right?

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay, so really, I wasn't like convincing
my mom, my mom asked me kind of a long

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
time ago, like, Hey, like what's Bitcoin?
And I was like, I can't give you a really

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
good answer. Let me like read and learn.
And you know, like two months later, I was

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
like, Oh God, Bob, we need to, we gotta
like, look at this. So like her and I both

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
kind of like went a little bit in and then
that led me to, you know, Cardano and then

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Ergo.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And then you know the crash and everyone
was depressed and all this and my mom

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
honestly like forgot about it and then you
know when everything was super low. I just

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
like kind of brought it up again I was
like hey mom you need to like get back

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
into Coinbase and like you should buy a
little bit more now because you're gonna

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
have twice as much buying power and it'll
be worth it.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah. It's funny too, like you were
saying, right? Some people are like, well,

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
didn't it just crash? They weren't saying
that, right? In 2008, 2009, when the

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
housing market crashed, you know, people
were buying up a bunch of houses. If you

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
have the liquidity, of course, a lot of
people were hurting, but people weren't

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
going to say, oh, are you not going to buy
a house? I mean, of course, it's a little

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
bit different from an asset perspective.
But I don't know. I think it's

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
interesting. Maybe it's just so new.
People are still kind of, I mean, we're so

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
early even too, right? It's just so,
people are still just not really sure

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
about it, right?

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah, man. It's really funny. Like
whenever you start saying your honest

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
opinion about this to people, like how
early are we? Like you feel kind of crazy.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You know, it's like, yeah, no, it could
legit be in the millions. If, if Bitcoin

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
hits half of gold, that's like 400k.
That's crazy. Half of gold. And why not?

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Why not?

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah. And then with the current
administration, or not the current, the

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
next administration kind of coming in, it
seems they're suggesting, right? It could

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
be an indicator that's positive for
Bitcoin. And then also other people are

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
maybe starting to come around. I don't
know if you saw a tweet from Peter Schiff.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Peter Schiff's like, I'm starting to come
around. Maybe we can fix the social

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
security problem. He's like, if we buy 25%
of all of the Bitcoin, that would shoot it

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
up to 20 million. Then we would just hold
and coming up with all this stuff and that

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
would be amazing. Obviously good price,
but even for social security, like I would

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
love to retire and get social security,
you know?

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I think he was being sarcastic, but the
further he went along, it's like, dude,

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
you're making the exact point. He's like,
well, then you have to sell your Bitcoin.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And I actually posted the meme. Dude, I'm
going to actually show this meme real

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
quick. I won't show the meme. It's the one
where Neo is talking to Morpheus. And he's

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
like, so you're saying I'm going to be
able to sell my bitcoins for millions of

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
dollars? He's like, no, Neo. When you're
ready, you won't have to. I sent that to

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Peter Schiff, probably didn't see it. But
whatever.

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No, absolutely. I mean, and if what are
you saying, you know, right, maybe it will

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
be a reserve currency, and then you won't
have to sell it. And you know, there will

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
be all of these financial mechanisms to
where it's like, you can leverage your

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Bitcoin without selling your Bitcoin in
some sense. And we're starting to see

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
different vehicles with the stock market.
You can buy the ETFs. That's been doing

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
really, really well. Micro strategies. I
don't have you paid attention much to

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
micro strategies. That's a crazy volatile
index relative to Bitcoin. It's like, it's

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
hotter than Bitcoin. I bought some like,
when it first not micro strategies, but

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
when the ETF came out, and I'm up pretty
good. And it's just like, it's crazy, like

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
to see.

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah, dude. I saw when Grayscale,
remember when Grayscale was that just like

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:57,000
a deep discount? It was like nice little
discount, you know, and then...

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah. So it's a wild time. So when do you
think a hundred K is going to happen? You

84
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
know, right now, what is it around 90
something 92, 93?

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I think it said it was at 91 and then I
saw it at 89 dude, for all I know, it

86
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
could be like three o'clock. I don't know.
It wouldn't surprise me. It also wouldn't

87
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
surprise me if it went down and tested 70
K again. Just, you know, that's how it

88
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
goes. Like why not?

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Absolutely. Yeah, I think people are
going to probably start taking profits.

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And I mean, it's just been a super hot
week these last like three days. And then

91
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
now it's, you know, I would imagine maybe
some cooling down. But, you know, I'm sure

92
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
a lot of people are just bullish with this
new administration coming in from a crypto

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
perspective. And, you know, Bobby Kennedy
has even mentioned like, you know, some

94
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
things that he wants to do with Bitcoin
and you know, paying off the debt with it.

95
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And like, so I think there's gonna be a
lot of positives relative to, but of

96
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
course, we're biased because we've been
exposed to so.

97
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But overall, dude, super exciting. And
hopefully it kind of becomes normal. I was

98
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
starting this business with my wife and
was looking to use some of my funds to

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
borrow against them rather than sell to
start this business. And none of the

100
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Bitcoin anything, nothing related to
Bitcoin is eligible in the stock market at

101
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
least through Schwab or whatever. So all
the stuff I have in Bitcoin, I would

102
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
actually have to sell it that could borrow
against it unless I go through like, you

103
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
know, third party or whatever. So I'm
learning more about that kind of see how

104
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
realistic it is.

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That's interesting. Yeah, especially with
the stock market, right? Because it takes

106
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
because it's cool that's in the stock
market, but we actually lose a little bit

107
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
of applicability within the asset because
it sort of locks it, you can't move it, we

108
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
lose control. But of course, there's
certain vehicles why you'd want to do

109
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
that. Like I have my 401k, you know, I
don't really need to take it out and do

110
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
anything with it.

111
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So yeah, same. That's what I had it in a
sheltered account. And so it's like, you

112
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
know, doing all this tax free and I can
like make these trades without

113
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
capitalizing, you know, having to pay
taxes. So yeah.

114
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So hopefully this bull market kind of
carries over to Ergo. I've seen some

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
people, you know, like, oh, are we going
to see above all time highs? Some people

116
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
are starting to say, oh, I don't think so.
I'm not really sure. I haven't really

117
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
given it too much thought, but it's
exciting. I think nonetheless, these next

118
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
six months.

119
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So I actually put this in a tweet
yesterday. If you look at the price, it

120
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
looks bad, like per coin, right? But if
you look at the market cap, it's not as

121
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
bad. So market cap, we're one eighth of
the way. So we're at a hundred million

122
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
right now. And all time high was at like
800 million. Right. So, but price is like

123
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
$19 to $1. Right. So that looks bad, but
it's because all that heavy emission in

124
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
21, 22, and then now it's like pretty low,
the emissions pretty low. So per market

125
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
cap, like, I think we're okay right now
and ready to participate in the bull

126
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
market. Like, who knows? Are we gonna stop
at 20 or like send it to you know, $10

127
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
billion market cap one of these days.

128
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah, that was a great tweet that you had
because you were saying something up to

129
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the effect, right? Basically, the lower it
stays or the longer it stays in that sort

130
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
of level, the more sort of springboard to
sort of shoot up, right? And I could

131
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
probably see that too, you know, because I
think we've seen that, like, if you look

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
at Bitcoin, Bitcoin was trading in those
trenches for such a very long time like

133
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
you're saying right very similar Ergo the
emissions were extremely high people were

134
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
spending 10,000 bitcoin on a pizza you
know like very similarly here you know

135
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
with Ergo you know people are spending
hundreds of ERG right for for certain

136
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
things and so I don't know I feel like it
could probably it just needs time and it's

137
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
just inevitable right and so we'll see
what happens absolutely but I think we've

138
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
got a lot of good things confluencing kind
of together from an ecosystems perspective

139
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
to a community perspective the chain
itself.

140
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh, yeah So we'll see what else is going
on. We've got ErgoHack. What do you know

141
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
about ErgoHack? That's just finished up
and judging is about to start. Is that

142
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
right?

143
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah, yeah, I think Glasgow said in one
of the chats it started. I think it was

144
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
either yesterday or today. Yeah, ErgoHack
9 so that's pretty sweet. What was it?

145
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's about UI and mining so great theme. I
think. You know, Ergo is poised to be, you

146
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
know, one of the best proof of work chains
out there. So of course, highlighting that

147
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
to outsiders, I think is extremely
important. And then of course, relative

148
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
from the user perspective, you know,
harnessing the UIs and making our UIs a

149
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
lot better. Because I think for some, a
lot of people don't really like, I guess,

150
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
UIs in Ergo. But I feel like, to me, that
doesn't really mean much. And so like UI

151
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
is user interface. So like, what about the
UI? Does it make sense? And you brought

152
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
it, I think, I think we might've talked
about this on the last podcast where it's

153
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
like, well, what do we mean when we say
this is a bad UI? And I think you were

154
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
kind of saying like, basically know your
assumptions. What exactly does it do? What

155
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
it doesn't do FAQs, things like that. So
it would be cool, kind of interesting if

156
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
like there was a standardization relative
to UI. So like someone that's coming new

157
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
into the ecosystem could say, Hey, I want
to make something we could point them to

158
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Hey, this is sort of the standard. And
then we can kind of continue to build up.

159
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah, for sure, man. I think there's been
a lot of good things to come out of these

160
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
ErgoHacks. And even if it's not
necessarily a project that comes out, it's

161
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
like, just a culture that kind of develops
over time or people just kind of want to

162
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
help others learn. And a lot of this stuff
is open source. So like things, you know,

163
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
even if something doesn't work out or a
project dies, you know, like, I think

164
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
ErgoPad just shut down, right? But like,
it's okay. All that stuff is still there

165
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
to get reused. All the vesting contracts,
that's super useful. And somebody is going

166
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
to take that and use it. And same for all
these ErgoHack projects. Though, of

167
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
course, I hope they succeed. I saw some
cool ones on the list of the present

168
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
ErgoHack. One of them I was super excited
about was Minotaur. We've kind of been

169
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
waiting for a good multi-sig. I saw the
video. Looks pretty simple. You know,

170
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
that's exactly what we want.

171
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah. Well, so how does it work then? I
guess is it basically because for

172
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
multi-sig need multiple people, right?
Maybe four out of seven keys. So how does

173
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
it handle that? I guess.

174
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So the video that I watched, it was
really just showing like several wallets

175
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
being open at the same time. And when one
like submitted the transaction, it

176
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
appeared on all the wallets like you need
to sign this transaction. And then so all

177
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
the people would be able to fulfill that
obligation and then the transaction would

178
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
go through. And I think that's like super
necessary as I don't know, let's say

179
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
somebody got a million bucks in ERG in a
few years. You really need to think about

180
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
your security and ensuring that you're not
going to lose that. Like myself, I use the

181
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
steel plates. That's what secures my
funds, but I also give incomplete plates

182
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
to different people. And so they know,
like, if something happened to me, they

183
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
could talk to these other people and
figure out how to get my funds, right? So

184
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
they could like put their thing together.
But that, you know, that's a multi-sig.

185
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But it's a little tricky. And so this is
just like taking all the work out of that

186
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and all the sketchiness where I could
actually just like set it up and do it

187
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
legit, like thank goodness. Thank you,
Minotaur.

188
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Right. And I think too from like, like
you're saying, like, you know, I see some

189
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
people who have like hundreds of thousands
of ERG in a given wallet. That makes me

190
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
nervous. You know, I have multiple wallets
set up. But if you have a multi-sig and

191
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
you hold all the keys, you know that
that's kind of a reinforcement of like no

192
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
one's going to hack you because they have
to hack you maybe four out of seven keys

193
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
for example or whatever the case so I
think that's definitely an extra security

194
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
benefit security blanket makes you sleep a
little bit better at night with that's you

195
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
know if you're especially if you have if
it's a hot wallet right because I mean

196
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
that's eventually going to happen say you
take profits and you do have that much

197
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
it's like that's going to be nerve
wracking. You know what I mean? And

198
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
putting that all in a hot wallet and you
know, maybe some guy has your keys, just

199
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
doesn't know it waiting to see, Oh,
100,000 just popped in there. They run

200
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
their script or bots just waiting. I mean,
hopefully not right. But I'm just, you

201
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
know, thinking of the worst sort of
outcome that would be devastating. You

202
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
know what I mean?

203
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah, man. I mean, keylogger is probably
the easiest thing to happen to somebody,

204
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
you know, just they get your password,
remote access, gone.

205
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Right. It's like, dude. Yeah. And then
that's what's, in some sense, cool about I

206
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
guess it's more of more institution type
stuff because it adds like that security

207
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
blanket, I guess. But I don't know how
from an insurance perspective, like if

208
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
they were to lose your keys. But I think
at the end of the day, you got to take

209
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
accountability. If you're going to put all
that money into that sort of stuff, you

210
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
need to make sure you know what you're
doing. You know, like, for example, there

211
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
was somebody in Rosen that got scammed,
like, I don't know, 16,000 because he gave

212
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
his keys. But it's just like, dude, you
have 16,000 or like, how do you not know

213
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
that you don't do that? Like it's just
money growing trees for you. Like how do

214
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
you know what I mean? It's just like, it's
a weird concept that people sort of, I

215
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
guess, ape into something and then don't
do any like due diligence. So certainly a

216
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
wild west, but of course a certain level
of accountability needs to be in place.

217
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So let's see what else we got. We got a
cool one. 3D Ergo. Bro, you wanna talk

218
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
about 3D Ergo?

219
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yeah, so it looks like it's a, what would
you call this? An explorer for, I guess

220
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
not an explorer, right? More of like a
visual explorer, in any case. Yeah, like a

221
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
visual explorer. Looks at a specific block
and then you can zoom in on the given TXs

222
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and see where they're going and coming
from. I got it pulled up, let me see if I

223
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
can share this. And like this would be
really neat, for example, if like you had

224
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
one input and like 10,000 outputs, I would
love to see something like that, you know,

225
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
or like where people are trying to stress
test sort of the network. That would be

226
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
kind of really cool to see.

227
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Mark, while I'm doing this, do you wanna
look for the block that had the MiGoreng

228
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
drop?

229
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Okay, yeah, let me see. That one had,
let's see if we can, okay. So I'll talk

230
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
about this. So here's, these are the
transactions that are in the current

231
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
block. Oh man, I did this like 15 minutes
ago. Oh, there we go. All right. Now we're

232
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
cooking. So you click on it and you can
really see what each block is doing and

233
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
what it's connected to. And there's like a
starting point and an ending point and you

234
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
can, oh yeah. Look at this. Oh wow. Yeah.
I just think this is so dang cool. Like, I

235
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
think you would have to be doing this like
kind of purposefully to like really, oh,

236
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
look at that, there's a SigmaUSD.

237
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I think maybe a next step with this could
be from an analysis perspective to where

238
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
it's like maybe you put in your wallet and
then you can see all the different wallets

239
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
from a networking perspective that they're
connected to. So then you could, if you

240
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
were like, Hey, this guy has like, you
know, 10 million ERG, but he's doing some

241
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
weird sketchy stuff. You know, you can
maybe analyze all his wallets that he's

242
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
interacting with, and then kind of figure
out maybe what they're doing. Maybe it's

243
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
like the Silk Road and you can kind of
follow that a little bit more closely.

244
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah, that's a cool idea, man. I was also
thinking about it like you could see if

245
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
your privacy was broken, you know, like,
like, oh, did I make a mistake in my

246
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
wallet? Am I screwed? Do I have to like
mix all this again or whatever? You could

247
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
just put your wallets in here and see if
they connect. And if they don't, you're

248
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
good.

249
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Right. Yeah, absolutely. See if it's
traceable back to you. I mean, yeah, that

250
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
would be really neat. I mean, especially
from a mining pool perspective where we're

251
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
sending out, you know, transactions every
day, it would be cool to see like, based

252
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
off our sort of node, just the branches
and like how that sort of like ripples, so

253
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
to speak, throughout the ecosystem, people
switching stuff, moving it around. I

254
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
couldn't find the block. I found some
article on Reddit, but they didn't give me

255
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
that.

256
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Well, we'll come back to it. We'll throw
that up next episode. It sounds good.

257
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Probably crash there. They can pull it up
20,000 times. And so what else we got? You

258
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
have a project in this ErgoHack. Tell me.
I actually know very little. I saw your

259
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
tweets, something about NFTs and swapping.

260
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So no swapping. That was my last one. So
I'm calling it the Miner Rights Protocol.

261
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So MRP for short. And so essentially the
idea is to, it's similar to kind of mining

262
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
in and of itself nowadays. And so in order
to mine at a given mine shaft, you have to

263
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
buy the rights if you don't own the land.
You have to buy the rights to be able to

264
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
mine that. And so the idea here is that
miners would then buy this token, buy the

265
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
rights to this token, and then the
protocol owner of this token can then set

266
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
up various mechanisms for emission. And so
call it MRP as the token, for right now

267
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
and say we have 10 million for a given
Ergo block maybe there's a hundred

268
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
thousand or I guess a thousand are
released and then we can then tie the

269
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
emission to the miner that found the block
on Ergo so then we can essentially

270
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
bootstrap the Ergo protocol on top of a
token and then we can then emit this token

271
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
through the mining system instead of an
IPO or ICO initial coin offering. And

272
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
then, so then this way, whoever has the
rights will then, in essence, sort of

273
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
restrict sort of, I guess, the difficulty
in some sense, right? Because if only five

274
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
people have it, it's going to be pretty
difficult to mine. But if the entire

275
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
ecosystem has it, then pretty easy. But
again, allow for the miners to control

276
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
rather than so so then yeah another idea I
guess kind of with that is you could mint

277
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
NFTs with this and let the miners mint the
NFTs sort of programmatically and so then

278
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
the given block that a miner found could
be then used within the algorithm that

279
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
generates the NFT to then make that NFT so
it's driven by the sort of parameters and

280
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
so in essence it helps with rug pulling in
some sense because you can't the only way

281
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
to rug pull this is no miners are running
it and so so it's based off the miners and

282
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
so I can make one but they could be like,
oh, well, this is stupid. I'm not going to

283
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
run this. Oh, but I like this other one.
Or the mining pool could do it. And then

284
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
the mining pool could facilitate it. So
it's basically putting the token emissions

285
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
back into, specifically for tokens, into
the miners' hands. And then they can sell

286
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
them to whoever they want. But also, we
can gamify this, kind of developing an

287
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
idea within the game to where miners
finding blocks is gamified and then if

288
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
they find a block something happens like
so for example maybe they have some

289
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
probability of finding some given reward
and then if they get it then they get that

290
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
token. I don't have anything. I have some
of this coded out, but kind of in short,

291
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
we set up the emission contract and miners
will then verify that they found a given

292
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
block. They will then run off chain bots
to then collect this UTXO because then is

293
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
now spendable for that miner. And then the
person who's running the bot will then get

294
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
a little bit for themselves. Again, based
off the protocol, you could maybe not

295
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
incentivize people to run bots. But why
would you do that? It would make sense.

296
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Like, for example, if you're not a miner,
you maybe want to run a bot. So then you

297
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
could get a little bit of rewards for
giving a miner that given token because

298
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
they found the block and then you can kind
of facilitate it from there but of course

299
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
only mine it if you have that given rights
token and then the rights token can help

300
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
with I suppose the price because say you
have I don't know 10,000 rights tokens and

301
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
only one miner and one rights token is I
don't know one ERG and doesn't make sense

302
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
to have more than one, you know, then
you're kind of, and that's 10,000 ERG. So

303
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
then that could be sort of the market cap
for this given token initially. And so, I

304
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
don't know, so kind of playing around with
some of like the specifics, right. But

305
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
from a conceptual perspective, that's what
it is.

306
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Dude, that's so sick. So I think maybe
previously there was something about like,

307
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
a specific mining pool. If you are in this
specific mining pool, then they can

308
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
distribute tokens to that pool. But yours
is not a pool, but it's whoever's holding

309
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
that token.

310
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Right. Yeah, exactly. And then it has to
be a miner. Yeah. So just somebody,

311
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
anybody mining who has that token would
then be eligible to earn your tokens if

312
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
they find a block.

313
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And then
again, we can like build upon this. So

314
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
where it's like, say, you're not a miner,
but you want to like invest in my mining

315
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
company, right? Because so then you could
buy mining rights tokens for me and then

316
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
stake your mining tokens on my rigs or
something like that and then you get a cut

317
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
of my rewards when I find a block because
you can like maybe within the protocol the

318
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
more mining rights tokens you have that's
as a multiplier for how much is emitted

319
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
you know and so but then you can also,
that's true. Maybe in six months, the

320
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
general emissions are cut in half. You
know, so you could have halving, you can

321
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
have a logarithmic curve, you can have a
linear, you can do whatever you want. The

322
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
idea is really kind of sort of to kind of
create this putty and then we can stretch

323
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
it kind of however we want it to fit the
sort of space that we need. So it should

324
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
be pretty flexible in terms of what people
like. So I'm hoping to make an entire user

325
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
interface. So then if you wanted to make
this, you could do that. And then people

326
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
then just put in the proxy contract
address in terms of off chain bots, and

327
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
then they could just be on their way. And
then it would just kind of work together.

328
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Sounds like you need somebody to create a
new project and wants to distribute some

329
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
tokens.

330
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah, right. Otherwise, I think I might
try to release the first one. But yeah,

331
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
it's going to be fun. And then if I create
it, right, I don't get any money from

332
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
this. Right. I mean, unless I put it in
the protocol fees, but people will be able

333
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
to see that. So it's not like people can
just create something and it's not obvious

334
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
a rug pull. You know what I mean? So it's
just a different way to make miners more

335
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
income potentially. Right. Cause it's up
to them if they want to buy the tokens or

336
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
not.

337
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Yeah, I can imagine a lot of different
uses like one way or the other, you know,

338
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
yeah, but you have a good point. You know,
not everything needs a token. That was

339
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
something I read very early on in Ergo and
kushti was maybe criticizing Chainlink a

340
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
little bit, like, why do you have a token?
Like, you're an Oracle, you could use the

341
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
ETH of like, what's this for? You're
clearly just trying to get some money

342
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
here.

343
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Totally, totally. So I think for this,
kind of on that sort of, like, yeah, I

344
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
guess, in some sense, yeah, definitely
don't need to, but I think from an

345
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
educational perspective, it's kind of cool
to see because then people are running off

346
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
chain bots, you know, and maybe people
aren't privy to what that is. And so, you

347
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
know, that's kind of a cool mechanism to
kind of explore. So maybe some

348
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
educational, but even what's really cool
in my mind is just bootstrapping the Ergo

349
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
protocol on top of this. So then, you
know, we're essentially kind of, it's not

350
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
a side chain. It's not like a layer two, I
guess, but it's, I don't know. It's like

351
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
a, it's like an in-between layer on Ergo,
I guess. And we're just essentially using

352
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
those tools and kind of creating our, and
now you have wrote this, I'm glad you

353
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
thought of it. So it's like a synthetic
GPU mining. So the miner rights are

354
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
essentially synthetic GPUs. You buy those
synthetic GPUs to be able to have the

355
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
access to mine this given token, just like
how Ergo is. Right? I'm buying a GPU and

356
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
that gives me the right to mine Ergo. So
pretty interesting. I think at least dude.

357
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Yeah, that's a sick idea. Congrats.
Thanks. Yeah, we'll see what I'm curious

358
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
what other people think. So I'm super
pumped to get this developed and out the

359
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
door.

360
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Right on, man. All right. Well, what
else? What else do you want to talk about

361
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
today? We've been going for about 30
something

362
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yeah, I mean, we can definitely, I'd say
so we talked a little bit about maybe some

363
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
standardization with UI, right? And maybe
why that's important. So I think kind of

364
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
pivoting back to that, we have the Ergo
improvement proposals. And that's, to me,

365
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
is kind of like the shows the topology of
the chain and sort of how it works, why we

366
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
do certain things. So why do we have proxy
contracts or why do we do certain things

367
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
like with Babel fees or. So if you haven't
looked up at the EIP, I'd say definitely

368
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
kind of take a look. You know, there's
there's artwork standards. There's I think

369
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
the most recent. I know that's not true,
but like there's a collection standard for

370
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
NFTs, you know, so maybe you've heard
that. So I know Cyberverse has its own

371
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
collection. For the NFTs and maybe you
thought well, why is that a thing? Well,

372
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
we can read on the Ergo improvement
proposal of why that was a thing There's

373
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
probably a problem that was looking to
solve right and this is the solution for

374
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
that. So I think it's kind of like for
lack of a better word it's like the Bill

375
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
of Rights of the chain in some sense of
like, you know of why we're doing certain

376
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
things a certain way I guess

377
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah, okay. That's super cool. So maybe
let me say it back. So an EIP is like an

378
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
agreement among the users of Ergo that
this is the way we're going to do

379
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
something specifically and it's like
limited to whatever the EIP says or is

380
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
like the topic that they're talking about.
And the purpose of that is to just make

381
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
sure that we're a little bit more
organized and can like kind of agree upon

382
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
like a procedure for this specific set of
actions like NFTs or whatever. We had

383
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
talked previously about the emission
reduction. That was one EIP that got

384
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
proposed and passed. Let's say I have an
idea for an EIP. How do I propose an EIP

385
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
and how does that get approved?

386
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
That's a great question. I know there's a
repo and I'm looking at it right now and I

387
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
think you essentially just put in a pull
request because there's a bunch of

388
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
different EIPs that are I guess being
voted on and I'm not sure who votes on

389
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
them. Maybe the miners vote on them. I'm
not really too sure. Maybe we can get

390
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
kushti on here and he can help us out with
that. I think he'd be a great person to

391
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
talk to on that. Yeah, because we have,
there's like 26 pull requests right now in

392
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
the EIP. And I know one of them, right, it
was written by qx() with like ephemeral

393
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
tokens. And so I think the general
generality of the idea is just kind of put

394
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
a good use case, kind of explain the
problem, right, and then why we kind of

395
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,000
need this sort of standardization. So
like, kind of going to an example here is,

396
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,000
would be EIP-5, so it's a contract
template. And so you might be able to see

397
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
in some of the ErgoHack submissions, a lot
of people are using this template to

398
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
facilitate the explanation of their given
contracts. And so, let's see, does it say

399
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
anything specific? So, I mean, it just
kind of tells you, right, just the given

400
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
formats or maybe this is the right one. In
any case, definitely worth checking out

401
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
and then even comparing to like Bitcoin's,
proposals and improvement proposals and

402
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
other things, and things like that.
Because again, I think it's important to

403
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
kind of take a look at and for a while I
didn't really, wasn't really aware of

404
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,000
this. And so, I mean, EIP-27 is the soft
fork, emission retargeting soft fork. So,

405
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
it's definitely, you know, something to be
with the ecosystem, right? So.

406
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Yeah, yeah. I wonder, like, if some
things are voted on and others aren't, or

407
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
does everything need to be voted on by
miners? It's like, I kind of wonder, you

408
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
know, what's the scope of an EIP, you
know, like is an EIP always, cause it

409
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
sounds like the contract template. Like
that's not something that's in the core

410
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
protocol, you know, that's like something
people are just kind of agreeing on using.

411
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So like, does that get voted on by miners?
Or is that just like, did we just talk

412
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
about it in GitHub? And everyone's like,
cool, right?

413
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Yeah, you know, what's the consensus
mechanism, I guess, for accepting the

414
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
social layer? Yeah, I'm not too sure, to
be honest. So I would imagine for forking,

415
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
miners need to approve that. There's
probably a vote. But if there's no fork,

416
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
so EIP-6, Informal Smart Contract Protocol
Specification Format, that is the one I

417
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
was actually referring to. But that didn't
need a fork. maybe some of the core devs,

418
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
maybe from EF, that sort of thing, we're
like, hey, this is a really great way to

419
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
facilitate that and let's accept that and
then becomes an improvement proposal. So I

420
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
think the heart of it is, like you were
saying, it's not part of the core

421
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
protocol, but it's an improvement. And if
it makes sense to, I guess, the core devs,

422
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and I think, it's always subject to
change, you know what I mean?

423
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Maybe that's it right there. If it
requires a soft fork, it requires a vote

424
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
by miners. Right. I bet that's it. Oh,
look at us. We're learning.

425
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
But yeah, definitely it's interesting.
And so when I was writing some contracts,

426
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I kind of stumbled upon this and I was
like, oh, I need to kind of pay attention

427
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
to this. And so if you're a new dev to the
ecosystem, I mean, a great place to start

428
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
to understand Ergo and the topology is for
sure the EIPs.

429
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Yeah. And I think I think even not devs
should should kind of understand you know

430
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
just like know your assumptions you should
know a little bit you don't have to be

431
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
like super technical I don't think I'm
super technical but I'm like aware of

432
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
these decisions that are being made that
are going to affect my bag, you know, it's

433
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
like, yeah, you got to know, you got to
know. And if you don't know, it's your

434
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
fault, because it's all public.

435
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Yeah. And then from a, you know, bag
perspective, like, maybe why should I

436
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
invest in this? What are they proposing in
the future to be an EIP? Maybe they have

437
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
something that's like, very critical, and
that could be really interesting. So like,

438
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I know, right now, sub-blocks are kind of
on the hot topic right now. So I would

439
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
imagine there's probably an EIP kind of
coming up or in the works potentially for

440
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
that. There's one on storage rent, right?
So it's very interesting. Yeah, definitely

441
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
worth taking a look at and kind of diving
into just to kind of be more of a bull, I

442
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
suppose, for Ergo, because there's a lot
of stuff happening. And this is a great

443
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
way to see that, right?

444
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So maybe I'll share this and we can talk
about it and then wrap up. I made this

445
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
yesterday, and your talk about EIPs and
all this stuff is in the GitHub, and it's

446
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
all right there. It's here for everyone to
see. And when I go through that exercise

447
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
of really understanding Ergo, I could just
kind of see where all these things are

448
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
just falling short. It's like, if anyone
who's in these anyone outside of Ergo is

449
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
listening to this and you're involved in
these projects like like take take a

450
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
second and look at what we got man like
it's just so clear how none of these

451
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
things are going to stand up like none of
these things stand up dude I actually saw

452
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
a tweet from somebody from Luna Classic
yesterday and I just I couldn't I couldn't

453
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
believe it like what are you doing what
what are you doing

454
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Right. What did they, what did they say?

455
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Oh, just like, I don't know, they were
just like, hyping it up. Like, are you

456
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
serious? Like, are you serious?

457
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Yeah, I'd say, you know, it's hard to,
you know, be, I guess, unbiased,

458
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
especially if you got so much money. And
maybe that's the case for them. And I

459
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
think it's important to I mean, and that's
a great what you did there. It's a great

460
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
you know, exercise in validating your own
sort of ideas on Ergo, right? Because it's

461
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
like, well, is it the best or, you know,
is this a good idea? And, you know, we're

462
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
able to kind of run through those specific
other chains, kind of see where they fell,

463
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
you know, and it seems, right, Ergo is
kind of, you know, kind of this top dog in

464
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
the sense of its protocol and, you know,
everything it kind of stands for compared

465
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
to these other chains where they've in a
sense fell short, right? Because I'm sure

466
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
they had a, yeah, go ahead, sorry.

467
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
No, to your point, I think when you kind
of get married to a bag, you get in some

468
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
blind spots. And I was trying to be a
little bit funny with some of these. But

469
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
also, I don't know, maybe illuminate some
of these things like Litecoin. You're all

470
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
in on Litecoin. That's it. That's what
you're doing. And maybe a few people would

471
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
kind of just reflect and be like, oh, it's
been 15 years and maybe something is a

472
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
little bit better.

473
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Right, absolutely. Yeah, especially from
a tech perspective, because it's just

474
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
like, you know, Litecoin is just a copy of
Bitcoin. There's not really anything

475
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
inherently special. So I guess with that,
you know, when do you think Ergo is going

476
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
to get a fork? And we'll start to see Ergo
get forked in the sense of like light Ergo

477
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
or like, you know, Doge Ergo, in a sense
of like, it's a copy of it, just like how

478
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
these other coins have, you know, do you
think that'll happen?

479
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I'm sure Ergo will get forked. I mean, I
am surprised it didn't happen with the

480
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,000
mining reduction. Very easily could have
happened. Ethereum forked when they

481
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,000
started messing with their mining and got
rid of their mining. Totally. Yeah, it

482
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,000
wouldn't surprise me if there was some
update that a substantial amount of people

483
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,000
didn't agree to. But that's why we do soft
forks. Ergo kind of is committed to not

484
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
having hard forks because we recognize the
value of a coherent social layer where

485
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
we're kind of all on the same team. And if
the majority of us don't agree to

486
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
something, well, then we're not going to
do it. Totally. And I just appreciate

487
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
that. And honestly, I wish that our actual
government had some sort of function

488
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,000
where, like, if somebody makes a proposal
and 90% of the population votes for it,

489
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,000
that should be a law. Right. That should
just be a law. And I don't know. Maybe

490
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,000
that will happen sometime, but probably
not.

491
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Yeah, I mean, I think it's a good
indicator in some sense of like, you know,

492
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
the ethos of the community that we haven't
had a hard fork for like Ergo Classic or

493
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
some shit like that, because it's like,
you know, we are true to our values. And

494
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
so because of that, we're still on the
same lane as we've always been versus like

495
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
something like Bitcoin. OK, we're going to
fork to Doge just to make a joke. Oh,

496
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
we're going to fork to Litecoin because,
you know, we'll be the silver or whatever

497
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
their original, you know, whatever it is,
you know, kind of going after money.

498
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Right. They're doing it for the wrong
reasons. Bitcoin Cash, same thing. You

499
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
know, going after the money. Whereas, you
know, that's not necessarily the case

500
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
here. So people are kind of in it for the
core values, for the everyday people, kind

501
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
of that sort of thing. And that's kind of
cool to see. Hopefully, after this, we

502
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
don't see the hard forks take place. I
think it's a good sign from a community

503
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
perspective that that hasn't taken place
yet.

504
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Yeah, 100%, man. Totally agree. I think
this might be a good place for us to wrap

505
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
it up. So thanks, Mark.

506
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Yeah, thanks, Tim. Have a great time
everybody. See ya.
