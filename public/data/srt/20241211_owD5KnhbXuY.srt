00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey guys, I'm Gvuldis from the team
Kropli and we are here to introduce you to

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
On-Ergo.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It is an amazing tool that we are
building here on Ergo and I hope that you

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
guys enjoy and find it useful.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So let's start our presentation by
talking about the problems that we are

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
going to address.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm fairly sure that most of you guys
have seen what has happened with Cardano

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
over the last few years since it is of
course our testnet. It started well with a

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
wallet and then boom, it was overwhelming
so quickly and it was basically impossible

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
to stay updated on most developments.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This was at least my experience, I don't
know about you guys, but we believe that

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ergo, though considerably smaller right
now, is going to end up on the same path

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and face this same problem.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And we believe that it is better to solve
this problem sooner rather than later. And

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Cardano, as far as I know, still doesn't
have the solution for this. That's why we

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
are here right now.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
One more problem that inexperienced
people face in crypto is that things are

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
much more complicated than we as
professional community members think. The

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
reality is that most people investing in
crypto will never withdraw their coins

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
from centralized exchanges because, well,
it is simply too complicated at this stage

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
of time.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
As of now, there isn't really a clear,
consistent guide for navigating the

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
ecosystem and exploring all the
opportunities that it provides or will

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
provide in the future. And newcomers are
just scared to make mistakes with their

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
money. They need to be encouraged somehow,
in some way. And marketing, when?

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So on Ergo, our solution to these
problems that we started to create during

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Ergo Hack 9 will provide both new and
experienced users with an event calendar,

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
an educational platform, a Discord bot,
and with some very nice incentives to get

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
people to discover new possibilities
on-chain.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Let's take a look at them separately with
more details. First of all, an event

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
calendar. Whether it's community meetups,
dApp launches, updates, or special events,

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
everything gets listed here. And it's
super easy for projects as well as

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
community members to add events
themselves.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We are still polishing the details and
permissions for adding events. However, we

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
want to make those rules as decentralized
as possible. For now, possible solutions

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
include a Discord bot integration or NFTs,
granting the possibility to post. So

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
you'll always know what's happening, when
and where.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Imagine not having to dig through 10
different channels or announcements, it's

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
all here in one place, and you don't have
to miss anything. We are aware that this

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
might not be as useful at the moment,
however, as I mentioned before, this can

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
become very useful with several project
pre-sales launching at the same time

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
during Ergo's exponential growth.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Here you can see a small preview of the
very early stage development that we have

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
done so far on the event calendar.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So, besides just keeping you informed, we
want to help everyone learn about Ergo

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
too. That's where our educational platform
comes in. We are creating a quest roadmap.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's kind of like a game where each quest
is a learning opportunity.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
For example, your first quest might be
something as simple as creating a wallet,

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
then maybe sending your first transaction
or integrating with the app. Each

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
completed quest brings rewards. So you're
not just learning, you're playing a game

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and earning along the way.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Our goal here is to build confidence and
knowledge, guiding you from a newbie to a

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Sigmanauts, step by step. We have made
some of these roadmaps, however we don't

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
want to reveal too much so that we can
make the launch even more exciting.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Here's a small preview of a start of a
potential quest roadmap on the educational

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
platform about the Cyberverse game. Each
new quest unlocks after the previous has

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
been finished. And this is basically how a
start of such roadmap could look like.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Our Discord bot is like the backbone of
this whole experience. It's integrated

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
with the platform and acts as an assistant
for the community. Let's say you're

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
curious about upcoming events. Just type
slash events and it will list everything

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
that's on the calendar.

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Projects can also use the bot to add
events directly with a slash add event,

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
making it instantly accessible to the
whole community. As I already mentioned,

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
we are thinking of possible solutions for
adding events, and one more possibility

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
would be to integrate this Discord bot in
Ergo ecosystem's Discord servers, make

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
them follow the announcement pages, let
the posts go through AI check, and

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
automatically add the event mentioned in
the announcement to On-Ergo's calendar.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We are exploring many options and we will
make sure to choose the best one with the

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
help of Ergo's community and its feedback.

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Now, what's a community platform without
some incentives, right? We are going to

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
have leaderboards, raffles and rewards to
keep things fun and engaging. So, if

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you're completing quests, attending events
or just actively participating in the

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
ecosystem, you'll be recognized for it,
and who doesn't love a bit of friendly

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
competition.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
These incentives are all about building a
healthy, active community where everyone's

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
excited to contribute and engage.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
On-Ergo is more than just a platform.
It's an innovative approach to managing

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and navigating the Ergo ecosystem. We are
combining event management, gamified

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
onboarding, and DeFi accessibility all in
one. We're creating an ecosystem hub that

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
doesn't just give you information but
actually helps you experience the

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
ecosystem hands-on.

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This innovation is all about making Ergo
user-friendly and accessible from

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
beginners to seasoned pros.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Our community is at the core of
everything we are building with On-Ergo.

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This platform is designed to grow and
evolve with community input. We want to

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
hear from you, your ideas, your feedback,
your events. On-Ergo will make it easy to

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
organize and promote community-led events,
building a central hub for the entire Ergo

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
family.

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Together, we'll create a thriving,
connected ecosystem where everyone can get

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
involved.

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So who will actually benefit from this?
First of all newcomers, because On-Ergo

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
simplifies the entry into Ergo with guided
learning and easy-to-find events. Then the

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
community, because the platform helps by
summarizing all updates and events in one

94
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
place.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And projects, new projects especially,
can gain visibility and engagement with a

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
simple way to list events and updates and,
well, On-Ergo strengthens the entire Ergo

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
ecosystem by making it more accessible and
pushing people to use the ecosystem more.

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So, what's next? We're starting with the
essentials, the event calendar and the

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Discord bot to get the foundation in
place. Then we'll expand with more

100
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
educational quests, enhanced incentives
and user-driven updates.

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We are also planning to open source the
project later on so the community can

102
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
contribute directly. This roadmap is
flexible. As we grow and get feedback,

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
we'll keep adapting and improving to make
sure that we are meeting the needs of the

104
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
community.

105
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
In summary, On-Ergo is here to bring the
Ergo ecosystem together, all in one place.

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Whether you're looking for events,
educational resources or community

107
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
incentives, we want On-Ergo to be your
go-to hub. Our mission is to make Ergo

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
simple, accessible and engaging for
everyone.

109
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
One ecosystem, one platform, that's
On-Ergo. Thank you for being here and

110
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
let's work together to make the Ergo
ecosystem the best it can be. Thank you

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
for letting us participate in this Ergo
hack and thank you for attention from

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
On-Ergo.
