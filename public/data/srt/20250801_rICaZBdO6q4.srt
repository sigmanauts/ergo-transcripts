00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Welcome Ergonauts to the July 31st 2025
episode of the AMA with a lot of Ergonaut

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
luminaries on board to educate you and
answer your questions.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If you are on YouTube, welcome. If you
want to ask questions, we will try to have

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
a look at the comments there. But if you
want to participate directly, please join

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
us on Zoom. Links are in the Discord or
the Telegram channels.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And without further ado, here is Mr. QX.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Are you going to pass it off to me?
Thanks for the intro. Fantastic. Well, I'm

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
on the road today, but still joining you.
If I crash, you'll witness firsthand the

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
first blockchain death. So that could be
something that would elevate Ergo to new

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
heights. But otherwise, yeah, please join
up.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The links are in the Telegram chat or the
recent Twitter post from Ergo platform.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
kushti put up some topics for today. One
of them is Sigma Lock, so I can comment on

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that real quickly before I pass it off to
kushti for the two topics that he popped

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
up and maybe wants to talk about.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We have not had any progress this week
with it. Last I talked to 4i's consulting,

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
they are going to push it to their
reversal for sigma testing. The domain is

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
already, it's going to be sigma lock at
sigmanauts.com. That's a lot of sig, I

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
guess, right? But hey, you can't have too
much Sigmanauts.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And we're going to test it out in our
group first, just a little bit, and then

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
we'll release it to the wild once it gets
on to our permanent server. So looking

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
forward to that.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
For those of you that don't know, we
used, we did a DAO vote in the Sigmanauts

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
two weeks ago to buy the kushti two-hour
token. And what that does is kushti put up

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
his own time on MewPhysicals, MewFinance.
Then you can buy a token which grants you

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
two hours of whatever you want to do with
kushti. I don't think you got specifics,

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
so if there's any time left over, I might
get creative. kushti, you better watch

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
out.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So we did a DAO vote and we spent 70,000
Mew, which is around 500 bucks at the

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
time. And we purchased two hours of kushti
time and the SigmaLock contracts are going

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
to be officially reviewed by kushti
himself. So that should bring us a little

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
bit of confidence into the actual platform
that we're trying to put forward here for

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
everybody to use. So we're really excited
about that.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And then on top of that, since kushti has
70,000 Mew now, if you guys didn't miss

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
the chat yesterday, he offered like
bounties for people willing to do videos

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
on MewFinance and MewPhysicals and the
things that MewPhysicals, the swap app

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
that you just made, all that kind of
stuff. So if you're looking to make some

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
cash and you do videos then reach out to
kushti and see his post there to see what

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
you can earn from doing that. But yeah
excited about the release of Sigma Lock

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and looking forward to it.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah, so I've announced three prizes for
20K Mew for creating tutorials on how to

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
use some new services, any of them because
I think like everything is not so well

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
covered with guides and tutorials at the
moment right. So yeah it could be text or

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
video so yeah please share in the
MewFinance group and Ergo platform group

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and yeah I'll check them a bit later.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So yeah, well, I think we need for more
tutorials and yeah for more circulation,

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
right? So yeah, I mean somehow you make
those 70k Mew. Then, yeah, I've got them,

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
right. I'm paying for tutorials with them
and hopefully, yeah, the guys received

48
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
those Mew will do something further.

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So, yeah, well, I think we need to do as
much as possible positive circulation of

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,000
different monetary value of ERGs and
tokens in the ecosystem. Yeah, so there

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:29,000
could be a lot of inventive ways. And
after all, as well, the ecosystem is not

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,000
that big now. So it's basically the same
money after all, right? Going circles,

53
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:47,000
making multiple hops, working efficiently,
right? So yeah, well the more circulation,

54
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
the more velocity, the more services being
created and sold along with condenser and

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
so on, the better for the ecosystem.

56
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And kushti, something I use at work for
tutorial videos when I make them quite a

57
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
bit is I'll record the video, usually one
take as best I can so I don't have to

58
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
edit. And I'll push that video through
Whisper AI so I get a beautiful

59
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
transcript. And then I'll take a few
screenshots of different screens of the

60
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
video in order, and I will feed the
screenshots and the subtitle file into AI

61
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
again and ask it to make me written
tutorial on the spoken tutorial and it

62
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
does an amazing job. So if you're okay
with just hitting that record button and

63
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
recording a tutorial, you feed it through
AI the rest of the way and it makes a nice

64
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
set of written tutorials for you as well.

65
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Right, and yeah, well, we need for some
experience, right, with Mew and other

66
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
services. So, Jimmy, maybe you can write
about your experience of selling Canon or

67
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Mew. And QX, you sold some Mac, Mac what?
Mac Pros?

68
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah, yeah. We sold some Mac Pros. We
sold a Macbook. We're going to sell some

69
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
of those little Intel machines as well. So
we're going to keep at it for sure. Yep.

70
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's funny too, because the other day, I
think, I don't know if it's on Cardano or

71
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
whatnot, but I was reading a post, and I
think HQ actually commented on it, so

72
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
maybe HQ can speak more if that was him.
People were like, oh, you know, there's an

73
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
issue with the blockchain. You know,
everything's digital. We need a physical,

74
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
you know, way to sell and trade goods and
that kind of thing. So it's definitely

75
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
starting to have an awakening of people
thinking, hey, why can't we use these

76
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
tools for this? And I mean, of course,
like everything else, Ergo has it long

77
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
before everybody even thinks about it.
Right.

78
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Also, we now have a lot of conversations
in the LETS group, so welcome. So, yeah,

79
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
we now have more people contributing and
brainstorming what to do because it's,

80
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
well, as I described a few times, quite
generic, right, to create, well, monetary

81
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
systems of quite different kind.

82
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So yeah well currently hopefully well we
will come to some design of application

83
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,000
rights to try and yeah it would be good to
make some Ergo-based application for

84
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,000
trading rights, not necessarily using
SigmaUSD or ERG even, just maybe like IOUs

85
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
created on the fly, but yeah with
blockchain guarantees.

86
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:22,000
blockchain reserve sometimes and yeah
well we can think about some demos like do

87
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
some I don't know hopefully markets around
the Ergo meetup or visit some event like

88
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
such a market and yeah well trade with
such location there. So yeah or something

89
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:46,000
like that, so please join LETS.

90
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Mark, how's the EF doing? Ergo hack's
over? You guys announced the winners and

91
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
everything?

92
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah, yeah, it's all done, all wrapped up
now and just on to the next thing. So

93
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
there's been a lot of trying to work out
the budget, trying to stretch it as far as

94
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
possible past the missions. And just keep
it going, keep the development and

95
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
infrastructure going as long as you can.

96
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And yeah, apart from that, we've kind of
fallen back on the editorial the past few

97
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
months because our editor left due to
personal reasons. So the past month, I've

98
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
just been trying to blast out as many
articles as I can. And try to spread them

99
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
around different chats. So like the Lithos
and ChainCash and stuff, that's really

100
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
good to kind of pull people in if you get
into those spaces and can explain it.

101
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So yeah, we should be trying to push that
kind of stuff out more, try to build up

102
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
our editorial more and kind of catch up on
that backlog in the past few weeks.

103
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Have you tested out the Banxa integration
into the Nautilus wallet yet?

104
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I have not and I've just seen a
screenshot, but I can't test anyway

105
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
because the UK has got these new crazy
laws that you need to be FCA approved or

106
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
send every tweet and blog post to a
company you pay like five grand a month to

107
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
approve everything. So it's just this
massive barrier. It makes us pretty much

108
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
the most restrictive place in the world
apart from sanctioned countries to provide

109
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
fiat ramps. But it's a big uproar.
Hopefully there'll be some, enough push to

110
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
kind of get it softened a bit. It came to
effect late last year. But yeah, it's a

111
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
bit of a pain that one.

112
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Wow. Do you know if it's just, I didn't
look, but is the Banxa button or Buy ERG

113
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
button, does that just take you to the
Banxa page or do you do it inside the

114
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Nautilus wallet?

115
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm not sure what kind of level is going
to integrate it. I'm sure we could do it

116
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
to the wallet itself. We may just be doing
it the first way for quickness at the

117
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
moment to get out. But yeah, I think
ideally we'd want it integrated right in

118
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
to the UI.

119
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What else we got guys?

120
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
As far as I remember, you need some
credentials to integrate Banxa and apps.

121
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So you will need to partner with them and
you will need to kind of dox yourself. So

122
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm not sure if Nautilus wants to do that,
or maybe EF would just get those

123
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
credentials for them to just integrate in
the wallet.

124
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, they'd be getting it through us.
They've offered to give us the contract

125
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and stuff with them.

126
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Well, in that case, if I can use those
also, I can even add them to the post

127
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
chat, so people can directly buy from
there. Or even I can add Banxa page at

128
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
VoltPay page so if there are people who
want to KYC and buy with it they can also

129
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
buy it from there.

130
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah I'm looking to see if that's
something we can do.

131
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Speaking of wallets Minotaur was also
released 3.0.1 for desktop and Android. I

132
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
don't think the iOS built this build,
right? I think you have to go get yourself

133
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
where it's not built. But for people who
haven't used Minotaur, it's a pretty

134
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
fantastic wallet. Just to have kind of a
personal standalone wallet, right? It

135
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
works really good on Android. It looks
pretty. They've integrated some new

136
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
changes for Multi-Sig as well in version 3
that make life a little bit easier. So I

137
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
encourage people to give it a test run.
Again, great wallet made by a great team.

138
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What else is new, guys? kushti, how are
sub-blocks?

139
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Going well, so I think there is need to
present some quite accessible writing,

140
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:17,000
right? So, well, I'm starting to work on
the white paper. Other than that, adding

141
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:25,000
some API methods and yesterday I realized
how to commit merge mined sidechain state

142
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,000
well quite efficiently using the current
API just and p2p messages so yeah we'll

143
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,000
describe it in the developers chat maybe
forum tonight so oh yeah it seems it's a

144
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,000
quite solved question so working also on
specification for merge mined sidechain

145
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,000
rights to pass it to our guys then.

146
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It will be in Rust language, so yeah,
well, it's for Rust developers. Well, I

147
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
can contribute also, but yeah, still needs
to catch up. We will Rust and a little

148
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:27,000
bit. So, yeah, well, we'll do a call for
contributors once it's ready. Yeah, well,

149
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,000
assign boundaries and so on. And then,
yeah, it's the question, how to fund it,

150
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
right? I mentioned my sidechains
development. We'll discuss it with Ergo

151
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Foundation, how much do we have, so we
still need to pay for Keystone integration

152
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,000
to PGR456.

153
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And yeah, we paid Dusig also quite a lot
in recent months for 6.0 in Sigma Rust.

154
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But yeah, probably we have some, so I can
start with that and then continue. Then

155
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
yeah, well, for other projects, well,
there are some new projects in Rust also,

156
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
such as Git Circle announced by my friend,
so I look for possibilities to assign

157
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:43,000
issues there. Maybe some bounties from
him.

158
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and then yeah well ChainCash and so on so
yeah well there is need to attract

159
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
probably a little bit of funding after all
but yeah it's still interesting how much

160
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
so there is need for more developers right
i think now it's time to get more

161
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
ErgoScript infrastructure peer-to-peer
developers on board right maybe try to

162
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,000
look through rust circles specifically
because it seems a lot of open source

163
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,000
contributors now around that language
specifically

164
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Then, yeah, so, well, more contributors
and yeah, well, I think it's a good time

165
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,000
to do another round of promotion for
ErgoScript, right? To get some more

166
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
contracts developers and then, yeah, well,
good maybe to also share some knowledge,

167
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
right, how to attract funding for
developers in the ecosystem right now. So

168
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,000
what options do we have? Using Raffle,
Raffle version 2 coming, Mew, what else do

169
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:22,000
we have? Well, different bounty programs,
right, and some grant programs. But yeah,

170
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
well, there is need for more, I guess.

171
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
kushti, when you talk about the other day
in chat, you said something like, you

172
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
know, you expect at some point to be
hundreds of merge mine chains once this

173
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
gets full rolling. Can you talk about the
benefits of another chain merge mining

174
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
with Ergo on these sidechains?

175
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah, sure. So in the first place, it is
a security budget for the chain itself,

176
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
right? So miners would receive some
additional rewards. Like they're receiving

177
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
additional rewards in Bitcoin, right, with
a variety of sidechains, like Rootstock of

178
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Namecoin, but it's not quite live Fractal
and so on and then yeah in Monero so now

179
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,000
they have Tari they will have Dark DeFi
and so on so yeah it would be good for

180
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
miners to get more rewards right it's good
for the base chain and then yeah well as

181
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
we have solutions for trustless transfers
so it's unlike Bitcoin, Monero probably as

182
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
well.

183
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Then, yeah, it also would be good to have
more liquidity locked, right? And

184
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:05,000
liquidity pools act as sidechain tokens
and products. Yeah, so let's have more

185
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:14,000
liquidity pools, tokens, material. All
right, would be good, I believe. rate and

186
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:23,000
yeah it's stability and growth.

187
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So yeah but we need also for more
experimentation right so somehow to get

188
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:41,000
folks that's why Rust was chosen in
particular right to get people maybe

189
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,000
thinking already on some blockchains, new
blockchains, blockchain-based peer-to-peer

190
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,000
networks, right, so to get to the right
available and yeah, easy bootstrapping

191
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,000
option and then yeah, easy liquidity
option, right, so well.

192
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:14,000
for new proof-of-work blockchains, not
just sidechains specifically. There are

193
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:23,000
not many choices regarding centralized
exchanges. big need for decentralized

194
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:32,000
on-ramp, off-ramp options. So if I
mentioned my inside chain, you will have

195
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:41,000
trustless swaps with Ergo, right? Then
presence of Ergo DEXs and then Rosen also

196
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:50,000
writes about immediate bootstrapping
against the biggest chains like Bitcoin.

197
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So Monero is coming to us, hopefully. So
then it's kind of a win-win, right? So if

198
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:12,000
you want to do some blockchain
experimentation, then you are getting

199
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:21,000
liquidity, hash rate, and yeah, Ergo
miners are getting some additional

200
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:30,000
rewards. Well, for liquidity traders and
so on to unlock more ERGs in DeFi.

201
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They'll be able to pull the merge mined
rewards as well as ERG, as well as storage

202
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
rent. It's like a triple.

203
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah, yeah. So yeah, it's basically the
next kind of box to unlock right after

204
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Storage rent. So, yeah, so emission, then
storage rent, then, yeah, merge mined

205
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:09,000
sidechains and so on. Well, unfortunately,
we don't have memes, right? But yeah,

206
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:17,000
maybe we'll have some alpha.

207
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Can I ask you a question about this merge
mined sidechain security issue? Is that a

208
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
two-way street? So, for example, if
there's a merge mined with Bitcoin and

209
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Ergo, in the long run Bitcoin has sort of
a security budget issue coming down the

210
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
pipeline, maybe four years from now, maybe
eight, whatever it is. Are we going to be

211
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
able to help them, especially if Ergo
begins to take off as a mechanism for them

212
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
to engage in DeFi and whatnot?

213
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yeah, so merge mined sidechains are
helping Bitcoin with security budget

214
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
issues, right? Yeah, well, currently,
merge mined sidechains A rather small ride

215
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,000
in comparison with Bitcoin, such as
Fractal, Namecoin, Rootstock, Rootstock,

216
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
probably the biggest one. I'm not sure
about Stacks, if it's merge mined or not.

217
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:31,000
For example, for Litecoin, the biggest
provider of security budget is Dogecoin,

218
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:39,000
which is a merge mined sidechain of
Litecoin. And yeah, currently, well, when

219
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:47,000
you see script ASICs advertisements, so
they're advertising doge mining in the

220
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:55,000
first place, not Litecoin even. So yeah,
well, but it's helping Litecoin, right, to

221
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:03,000
prevent attacks and so on, so to grow the
hash rate also to get more appreciated in

222
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:11,000
this regard. So yeah, then in the long
term, yeah, it would help Bitcoin as well.

223
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:19,000
True.

224
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And we've got a question from Canon as
well. Merge-bind liquidity pools require

225
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
liquidity. It seems that whales and ERG
are more passive with their, but for work

226
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
coin/value, what are the benefits for
whales that provide LP at one or two

227
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
percent? Probably doesn't cut it. How to
target that?

228
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I'd say probably do bigger LPs, but I
think the best way to incentivize them is

229
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:08,000
to kind of get them excited about the
prospects of a merged chain and things you

230
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:17,000
can do with it. That's the best motivator
if they think it has potential.

231
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And Ella asked, are the plans to make
Ergo quantum proof? As far as I understand

232
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
it, the cryptographic protocols that would
be quantum proof just now are still a bit

233
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
too exotic. And there's no rush, really.
The best option would be once they're

234
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,000
closer, it's an active threat. You could
just fork to a chain that has those

235
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
cryptographic protocols that are quantum
proof. But I think we're still quite away

236
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
from that, at least Ergo. I know the old
wallets in Bitcoin are exposed because

237
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
they use a weaker form of crypto.

238
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,000
eight years ago plus and one was actually
moved recently and a whole bunch of

239
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,000
bitcoins moved and they left a note on
trading saying if this is yours come claim

240
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,000
it. So people are speculating that
sometimes they break that old cryptography

241
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
on those wallets but it's less of a risk
for Ergo because we don't use that one.

242
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yeah, I asked about that a couple AMAs
ago, and I'm not sure, because she gave an

243
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
answer, but I'm not sure he was
specifically aware of that situation. In

244
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
the OP_RETURNs for some of those
transactions, there were sort of almost

245
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
legalese notifications about seizure and
sort of threatening that whoever owned

246
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
those wallets needed to take action
within, I think it was 90 days, which sort

247
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
of corresponds to American law about
squatter strikes. So I wonder, is it

248
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
possible that those actually were hacked?
And if so, how did that happen? It

249
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
probably wasn't a quantum computer. So is
it possible that there was some sort of a

250
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
problem with the early Bitcoin wallets of
that particular type and the way that

251
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
their seeds were generated. There was also
something along these lines about a year

252
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
and a half ago with Ethereum wallets where
a lot of Ethereum OGs were finding their

253
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
stuff just yanked and nobody really ever
got to the bottom of it. And then the

254
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
scuttlebutt kind of died down.

255
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Can somebody comment on whether or not
there is some mechanism that we don't

256
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
understand or is it something that we do
understand and are aware of and have

257
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
avoided in Ergo?

258
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yeah, it was a few weeks ago, so I've had
to refresh myself. But yeah, they used

259
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
early reused secp256k1 nonces. So people
have known they've been a lot weaker for a

260
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
while. But yeah, it's not actually known
how they got to it. It may just be the

261
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
actual person that's got it trying to do
money laundering or something. So it's

262
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
kind of up in the air. It's a bit of a
weird one. Why would they post that? only

263
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
just moving this to an anonymous place and
cashing it out. So yeah, it's a strange

264
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
one.

265
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah, so the brute force for now due to
poor entropy or nonce reuse, which

266
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
undermined independent security
guarantees. We don't use those in Ergo.

267
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I mean, in fairness, Mark, I can see both
scenarios, or I can see what you're

268
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
saying, like I lost my keys in a body
sitting kind of thing. They're trying to

269
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
launder the money. But look at Ergo in
that instance with the zero-day storage

270
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
rent bomb, right? There were several good
actors who spent the boxes and reformed

271
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
them to the same amount, of course. to
help out the people that the storage bomb

272
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
rent bomb affected so i don't think it's
out of the realm of possibility that

273
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
there's good actors in the bitcoin sphere
that you know said okay somebody's going

274
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
to steal this eventually but we'll give
them 90 days to try to figure it out and

275
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
then we'll just take it because it's
better us than somebody else perhaps

276
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Yes, it's definitely a possibility. It's
just obviously Bitcoin is not that

277
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
tight-knit anymore, and it was a lot of
money. I think if somebody found a hundred

278
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
thousand on their own ERG, it's probably a
higher chance to take it than somebody

279
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
finding a couple grand.

280
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,000
True, wow.

281
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
HQ, you built anything last night while
you couldn't sleep?

282
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Well, maybe I merged chains pulse. So
there should be decentralized on-chain

283
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
messaging between two chains. So it's
basically sending message on one chain,

284
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
sending message on another chain into a
smart contract in front and you're just

285
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
compiling and parsing the messages. So
both chains users can interact with each

286
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
other by just signing the access.

287
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Oh, wow. So that's Ergo and Alephium. You
might be emerging those two?

288
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yeah, I was planning to add Cardano, but
looking at that you need to spend two ADA

289
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
to send a message. I'm not sure if people
would like to do that.

290
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Maybe people will send smarter messages
if it costs 1.7 ADA. They'll really think

291
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
about what they're saying. Oh, that's
pretty nifty. So cool. So in theory, you

292
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
could have people stay on their home
chains and still participate in a chat

293
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
across all these chains.

294
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And the best part is that you can
showcase your product there, and if they

295
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
like it, they can use VoltPay to just swap
Alephium for Ergo or Alephium and

296
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
participate in both things and the
ecosystem. So the plan here is to have at

297
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
least a working or non-communities which
are there to create our own global

298
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
economy.

299
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Very cool, sir. Very cool.

300
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Is there an analogy?

301
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Yeah, you can send a kind of financial
messages, right? Basically, but then it

302
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:57,000
sounds like wormhole, right? Basically has
similar cross-chain messaging protocols.

303
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Technically, here we are not doing any
cross-chain stuff, so one person is doing

304
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
one thing on chain, another person is
doing another on chain, and the front end

305
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
is just passing the messages and showing
that on this chain, this person is saying

306
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
this, this person is saying that, another
chain, and you can reply to them by

307
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
registering their TXID or maybe their UTXO
box ID, and then you are just threading

308
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
the messages and showing them in the front
end, like it is a proper conversation

309
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
happening between two chains and two
users.

310
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So, I can find those messages only with
the front end.

311
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I mean, from another... Yeah, you can
find them on their chain too. You can find

312
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
them on... If they are messages on
Alephium, you can find them on Alephium

313
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and if they are messages on Ergo, you can
find them on Ergo. And if you want me to

314
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
create a registry which does grab all the
messages and register them on Ergo, we can

315
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
do that also and use that as a ledger. So,
many stuff can be done.

316
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
That would get expensive though, I
imagine. Posting to all 10 chains at once,

317
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
if you had 10 chains involved in this, I
imagine.

318
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Yeah, we can set a fee on top of sending
message and it should cover the minimum

319
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
UTXO amount. Well, on Alephium it is UTXO
and on Ergo it is box and Alephium is

320
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
0.002, Alephium on Ergo is 0.0004. So we
can maybe set 0.01 fee and each person

321
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
when they are submitting the message,
they're just creating another box and

322
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
they're paying for it. So yeah, I think
that can be done.

323
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Right, or you could incentivize, you
could put extra fees in the box in Ergo

324
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
and incentivize a batcher to run to dupe
messages over to the other chain and

325
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
collect that fee essentially.

326
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Yeah, the main idea here is to somehow
find a way to communicate with other

327
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
people, with real people, real users
outside of Ergo, to bring them to Ergo and

328
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
showcase them the DeFi they have on Ergo.
And if there are people who are building

329
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
nice DeFi on the other end and they want
to promote it, they can promote it also.

330
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And you still plan to release at least a
simple front-end open source so that

331
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
people can at least use a simple part of
it if they want to on their own machine?

332
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
The multi-chain version you want, there
is the Ergo version is already open

333
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
source, the Alephium version is already
open source, I'm just merging them into

334
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
one. So whatever message you're sending on
a Alephium, it shows on a Alephium one,

335
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
whatever message you're sending on Ergo
one, it's showing on an Ergo one, but this

336
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
one will just aggregate the messages in
one.

337
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Gotcha.

338
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:56,000
All right. So, will more blockchains be
supported like Bitcoin?

339
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I guess we can integrate more blockchains
to this. We just have to find a way to how

340
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
to parse a message on chain and then read
it and show it.

341
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
All right. But for Bitcoin, you can just
use OP_RETURN, right? I mean, it's a bit

342
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
limited, like 80 bytes, but probably
enough for most of the messages, short

343
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
messages.

344
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
My main plan was to just go with the UTXO
ones because they are not the most simple

345
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
ones. But yeah, more chains can be added
too, but it depends on how the volume and

346
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
other options come from, because you have
to understand that thing has to be here

347
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
when you stream. As we were talking about,
there has to be funding to build

348
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
something. It's not that I'm asking for
integration charges to the chains, but

349
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
there has to be incentivization for the
developer to develop something so more

350
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
people can use it. If you build something
and it's not getting used, it's just like

351
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
building for nothing, for me at least.

352
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
What do you do if you've got an EVM chain
and the transaction doesn't go through,

353
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
gets rejected?

354
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Well, then we don't go to the shitty
chains.

355
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So there is, there is one theory which I
was trying to, to, to check is that

356
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
technically in Europe, you can buy a gift
card in any stores. So where you can go

357
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and pay and you can get a gift card and
you can just redeem that and you get that

358
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
BTC in your, in your wallet.

359
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
They don't check KYC, but can you buy it
in cash? That's a question.

360
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yeah, you can buy in cash.

361
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
What? How?

362
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah, they're gift cards like, like
Nintendo Switch ones, Amazon ones, you

363
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
just go there and you just pay with cash.

364
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And you're positive you don't have to
take that gift card to their portal and

365
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
then register your name and birthday and
that kind of bullshit when you, when you

366
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
try to extract your Bitcoin.

367
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
The last time I tested, you can input
anything you want there. So yeah.

368
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And you can have some bullshit account
with, you know, some stealth email address

369
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
kind of thing. Yep. Oh, well, that'd be
interesting. Sorry, go on with your

370
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
pathway. Go for it. Sorry.

371
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
So what was I'm trying to do is you can
buy BTC by that way, right? And then you

372
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
can maybe swap that BTC with ERG. So
you're technically buying with your fiat

373
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,000
money. Another thing you can do is you can
buy that card or redeem it into BTC and

374
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
you can buy a prepaid card on VoltPay and
you can add that to Banxa too but I'm not

375
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
sure how Banxa works because as far I
heard you are required to KYC on

376
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
registration because if you have a prepaid
card you can add it to Google Pay and

377
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Apple Pay and you can buy with that too so
instead of fiat you are paying with the

378
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
credit card you get with BTC so yeah there
can be many routes can be done for this so

379
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
but I guess I will have to the sacrifice
code to test all this.

380
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
We had a couple of comments from Canon.
One was to point out that the MindHealer

381
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Cloud app is active and he provided a link
to that. It's mindhealer.cloud, which is a

382
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,000
service for paying for sort of I guess
therapy and also advice like for example

383
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
dietary advice using the blockchain
specifically Ergo right now I suppose that

384
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
could be expanded using Rosen or whatever
and I think that's interesting especially

385
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
because right now in the United States we
have this new process that the Trump

386
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
administration is launching to get all of
the big tech companies to start keeping

387
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,000
track of medical records, which sounds
like a complete nightmare to me. But it

388
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
does introduce an interesting potential
alternative to that.

389
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And then he also made a comment about
merge mining. He said, merge mine

390
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,000
liquidity pools require liquidity. It
seems like the world, the whales and ERG

391
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:57,000
are more passive with their, with their
coins and what are the benefits for whales

392
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:04,000
to provide liquidity of one or 2%. How do
we target the whales? How do we get them

393
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,000
to be more active in the community? HQ
says we already answered that one.

394
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And then we also had a comment from Jumei
saying, I guess this is a question for QX

395
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
asking about updates on the InfraDAO. When
is it happening? How is that going to

396
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
happen? What's it look like?

397
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,000
If you guys give me one minute, because
right now, as you mentioned, Jumei, I was

398
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,000
donated yesterday .erg and .mew subdomains
on FAKU. So me and Jumaia are going to

399
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:44,000
find a way to provide hosting on our
group. So if there are any people who want

400
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,000
to buy a host, so they can just get in
contact with us and we can just set up a

401
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,000
hosting service for them. A part of that,
if you're interested in buying some .org

402
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,000
domains or .me domains, so can be done
too.

403
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Awesome. Yeah, InfraDAO. So the vote just
passed. I think I just saw the transaction

404
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
into my wallet from Paideia. Lovely
Paideia, just a reminder. So with Paideia,

405
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I put up a vote that says, hey,
Sigmanauts, I would like 50,000 Paideia so

406
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
that we can form the official InfraDAO on
Paideia. I am and I'm the vote and I

407
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,000
attached 50,000 from the treasury of
Sigmanauts in to send to me after the vote

408
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,000
succeeded and the vote succeeded and I saw
I think it was last night of the night

409
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,000
before Ergo monitor bot popped up and said
you have 50,000 Paideia.

410
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
So that's in my wallet now and as soon as
I get a moment this weekend I'm going to

411
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
form the DAO and invite the initial four
or five members to it and distribute the

412
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
tokens there and then we'll dump the rest
of the InfraDAO tokens into Paideia once

413
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
we have those four or five founding
members in the in the what's it called in

414
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
the DAO so that we can invite other
members via vote and then we'll go from

415
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
there but yes it's it's a lift for me to
prep the four or five machines that we

416
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
need to do i just need to clone them and
put them out so that's a bit of a lift but

417
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,000
the bigger lift is for the people not
using our machines we are going to

418
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I'm put the version of explorer Docker
that I use. It was based off of easy

419
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Docker and easy. I forget what it was
called. It was called explorer front end.

420
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It's on the Ergo Foundation website. It's
a little outdated, but you can modify some

421
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,000
of the Docker comps in there to grab the
latest versions and tweak some things. So

422
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,000
that's been fully done. That's what I use.
It literally takes, it's like a zip file

423
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
that I use and I drop it down. to, what's
it called? And that's it. And it's been a

424
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
couple of things to say.

425
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So that's one of the steps that I can do
that's a little easier than setting up the

426
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
machines for people that want to join and
use their own machine. So you'll see that

427
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
on GitHub with some instructions on how to
do it. And that will be available, I

428
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
guess, for now if you need it. But the
other thing we're thinking about as well

429
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
is I offered a Ergo hosting just like HQ
did on the InfraDAO, depending on You

430
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
know, it's not just the InfraDAO is not
just going to exist for explorer and node

431
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It's also going to exist for Ergo docs for
sigma verse Those kind of things as well

432
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
as long as we have room on the machines
You know, we can we can fit that kind of

433
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
stuff and also some machines might not

434
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
run, explorer, and be part of the
InfraDAO. They might be running things

435
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
like Ergo nodes if they want to jump off.
Think of it like a community IPFS

436
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,000
essentially, but actually running web
servers for that. Currently, as I said,

437
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,000
the plan is volunteer out of the goodness
of your own heart. It'd be really nice if

438
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
we could find some method of helping fund
this to help pay for electricity or that

439
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
kind of thing for people. But for now, to
build it is just out of your own heart.

440
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I don't know if it was last week or this
week, it all blends together. There is an

441
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
InfraDAO dashboard that I built. That's
the spin up. And that has the main

442
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
explorer nodes. It's got all the P2P nodes
so far. It's got most of the websites for

443
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Ergo as well. And it has test nets up as
well. So that dashboard is in chat

444
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
somewhere. You guys can find it if you
need it. And it does more than just a

445
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
simple ping. It actually does four stages
when it tests the websites. It goes in,

446
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
tries to load content, tries to execute
scripts, and responds based on that. So

447
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
it's fairly thorough in the checks that it
does to see if the site's actually mine or

448
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
not, other than a ping.

449
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,000
So that's kind of the first build for
that that I put up. So yeah, come along.

450
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It's a big project and it's going to slow
burn for a bit as we get it. But it's not

451
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
something that I'm going to let pass away,
that's for sure.

452
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
All right, guys, I need to, I'm pulling
off to the airport right now to pick up my

453
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
friends. So I am going to, I'm going to
sign off, but you guys enjoy the rest of

454
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
the AMA. Thanks so much for joining
everybody.

455
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Thank you, QX. We're actually running up
on 10 o'clock, so I don't know if there

456
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,000
are any more questions. I don't see any in
the chat, but now would be a good time to

457
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
chime in. If not, let's back to the salt
mines for all of us, right?

458
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I'm going to take that as a vote for
everyone yearning for the mines.

459
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Let's continue over the Telegram.

460
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:31,000
All right. Welcome to join the Telegram
or the Discord. And there's great chats

461
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:38,000
constantly ongoing there. If you compare
the Ergo community to many others in

462
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,000
crypto, you will see that we are active
and people care and it's not just a few VC

463
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,000
fans that are hoping that they'll get some
crumbs, it's people actively developing

464
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:59,000
and discussing the future. So welcome
everyone.

465
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Thanks guys, so I'll catch you in just a
second.
