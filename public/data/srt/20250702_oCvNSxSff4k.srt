1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hey guys, I am Cheese Enthusiast and
today I'm here to talk about Lithos.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now I've made videos before but today I
want to give a bit of a different

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
perspective. Since the testnet is getting
close to coming out I wanted to do a video

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
for potential miners and what type of
information they're gonna need when they

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
start using the testnet. Just so you guys
have a better idea of what to do and what

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
kind of options you have.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Quick overview for those of you who don't
know, Lithos is a decentralized mining

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
pool protocol, which allows miners to
connect to smart contract-based mining

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
pools. These smart contracts ensure
fairness, they give complete control of

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
block production to individual miners, and
miners using Lithos can select storage

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
rent, they can select transactions, and
they can even earn ERG through

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
collateralization.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is just another overview of what we
already talked about, but yeah, in terms

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
of the benefits of Lithos, you get
complete control of block production on

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
the side of the miners. That means that
miners can select transactions, gain ERG

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
through MEV, and they can choose what
UTXOs they want to claim for demurrage or

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
storage rent.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
In Lithos, payments are completely
controlled by smart contracts and that

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
means that you know you're never getting
cheated out of any ERG. It's fully

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
transparent and it's fully fair.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Lithos also uses collateralized mining
pools. This is used to ensure

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
decentralization but it also means that
miners and people not involved in mining

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
can earn ERG through collateralizing
different mining pools and essentially

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
you're giving the ERG to the mining pool
so that they can help create the block and

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
doing that allows you to earn a fee.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now point four, this is what I really
want to focus on for this presentation.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's that Lithos or rather the Lithos
client is a locally run program. Now,

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
obviously that means latency and stale
shares are not a factor when mining on

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Lithos. But more importantly, it also
means that miners get full control over

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
the difficulty parameter. And that
parameter is going to be really important

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
when using Lithos because it can tweak
your profit levels. So let's talk about

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
that.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
When you're mining on Lithos, you have
obviously the stratum server on your PC.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And inside the stratum server, you have
the ability to control the difficulty of

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
the shares you produce. In Lithos, this
difficulty parameter is called D. And

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
unlike other mining pools where the share
difficulty is more about how many shares

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
you create and whether or not it's
overloading your network or whatever,

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
that's not so important on Lithos. What's
really important about the difficulty is

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
that it can help you manipulate your
reward consistency and the amount of ERG

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
you get per block.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So let's talk about using difficulty and
why it works differently on Lithos. So

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Lithos is not using traditional miner
payment systems. If you've been on other

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
mining pools, you may know about systems
like pay per share, pay per last end

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
shares, et cetera. Lithos uses a new
system based on non-interactive share

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
proofs. Now, not going to get into weeds
here about what that is exactly, but the

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
important part for miners is that changing
the difficulty inside this payment system

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
changes how you are paid and how much
you're paid.

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Now, when you first start mining using
the Lithos client, your difficulty

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
parameter will be automatically set based
on your hash rate. For example, if you

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
have a hash rate of 500 mega hashes, your
difficulty parameter in the configuration

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
file for the Lithos client, it'll just say
500M. Once it's been set, you're free to

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
adjust the difficulty up or down according
to your own preferences.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So let's talk about what exactly
adjusting the difficulty will do. So this

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
is a pretty simplified table, but it gives
us all the important information. So let's

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
assume a miner with 500 mega hashes
decides to try mining on Lithos. Let's say

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
the Lithos pool in total is one gigahash.
So this miner is representing 50% of the

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
hash rate for the pool. The table below
shows how changing this miner's difficulty

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
changes the total number of payments he
gets, along with the amount of ERG he gets

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
per payment.

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So when this miner first starts using
Lithos, their difficulty will be

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
automatically set to 500M. Now this table
shows a sample of how this miner's

62
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
payments might look over 100 blocks. So
when the miner sets their difficulty to

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
500M, they were able to get 98 payments.
They got around 7 ERG per payment and the

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
total amount of ERG they got was 686 ERG.
This is again over 100 blocks and the

65
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
block reward was 14 ERG for these blocks.
So considering this miner represents 50%

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
of the hash rate, they're getting 7.0 ERG
per payment.

67
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Now, if you look at the 300M difficulty,
which is obviously significantly lower,

68
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
the miner got 100 payments, they got 4.3
ERG per payment, and a total ERG of 430.

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
As for the 700M, the miner got 84
payments, 9.8 ERG per payment, and they

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
got a total of 823 ERG. So as you can see,
adjusting the difficulty value essentially

71
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
proportionally increases the amount of ERG
you get per payment, while it's inversely

72
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
proportional to the number of payments you
get. So increasing difficulty means you

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
get more ERG per payment, but less
payments. Decreasing difficulty means that

74
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
you get less ERG per payments, but more
payments.

75
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Now, that's not exactly the full story.
So yes, difficulty affects how much you

76
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
get paid and increasing the diff gives you
more ERG per payment. But in reality, the

77
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
instability of payments with a high
difficulty balances out the increase you

78
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
get in ERG. So this new table below shows
what's called the max potential. And this

79
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
is the maximum amount of ERG the miner
could have made within 100 blocks. So as

80
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
you can see for 300M, they could have made
a maximum of 430 ERG, which in this case

81
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
they did because they got paid for all 100
blocks. For the 500M difficulty miner,

82
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
maximum they could have made is 700 ERG
over 100 blocks. And for the 700M miner,

83
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
the maximum amount of ERG they could have
made in 100 blocks is 980.

84
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So that looks good, obviously, but
reaching the max potential is extremely

85
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
unlikely because it requires that the
miner is paid for all 100 blocks, which is

86
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
significantly less likely the higher the
miner's difficulty is. So what this means

87
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
is that, generally, increasing the
difficulty makes payments less stable,

88
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
even though it increases the amount of ERG
you get per payment. So it's very

89
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
unlikely, in the end, that someone hits
their max potential. So increasing your

90
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
diff doesn't necessarily guarantee you
more money over a long period of time.

91
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And you can see that below with what's
called the real potential. And that's the

92
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
average ERG per 100 blocks. So the maximum
potential is the real amount of ERG that

93
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
somebody could get in 100 blocks, assuming
that they're paid for every single block.

94
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
In reality, that's unlikely, and the real
potential shows the average amount of ERG

95
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
they're going to get per 100 blocks over a
long period of time. So you can see that

96
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
for 300M, the miner can still only make a
maximum of 430 ERG. For 500M, they can

97
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
make a maximum of 700 ERG per 100 blocks.
And the same thing for the 700M.

98
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So as you can see, increasing the
difficulty doesn't necessarily guarantee

99
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
you more ERG. Instead, it changes the
consistency of your payments, and it

100
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
changes the local instability in the
amount of ERG you get for a small period

101
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
of time. But as you can see, over a long
period of time, it all balances out in the

102
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
end.

103
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So what this means is that Lithos doesn't
let you cheat to get more ERG than you're

104
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
deserved, right? If you have 500 mega
hashes and you're mining at a 700M

105
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
difficulty, you're not going to get more
ERG per time. In the end, it all balances

106
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
out that you're still gonna be getting the
amount of ERG that's proportional to your

107
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
share of the pool's hash rate.

108
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And the table also shows that decreasing
difficulty reduces your earnings, so it's

109
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
not necessarily useful for a level like
300M, but there may be times where your

110
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
default difficulty level that you have is
maybe a little bit too high and you feel

111
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
that your payments are a bit too unstable.
In that case, you may want to decrease

112
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
your difficulty because then you'll be
getting more payments and you'll just have

113
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
a better idea and a better stability in
terms of how often you get paid.

114
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Now, this sounds too complicated. I
wouldn't worry. Using the default value is

115
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
probably good for most people. But if you
want to try and maximize what you can get

116
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
out of Lithos, I would definitely look
into playing around with the difficulty.

117
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And if you're on the testnet especially, I
would really appreciate if you could try

118
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
to mess around with the difficulty as much
as possible, see how you could break

119
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
things in a way.

120
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This is a new protocol so there's always
going to be unexpected emergent properties

121
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
that could come out so I think it's good
if you're on the Lithos testnet it'll be

122
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
good for you to play around with different
difficulty values, see whether or not you

123
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
can maybe get lucky if you increase the
difficulty, maybe you hit a lot of

124
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
earnings. Or if you feel that things are
unstable, you could try decreasing your

125
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
difficulty and see if that helps with
that.

126
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Just in general, I think it's good to
mess around with the difficulty. You'll

127
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
probably be able to get more out of your
mining that way as well. And specifically

128
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
for Autolykos 2, if you can try to factor
in the table generation time into your

129
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
mining and your hash rate, you can figure
out probably a better difficulty for your

130
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
specific hardware because table generation
time can vary depending on your hardware.

131
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So if you can factor that in, you can get
a better difficulty value that works

132
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
better for your machine and that'll
maximize your profits in the end.

133
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So lastly, let's just talk about the
mining features that'll be available in

134
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
the Lithos testnet. So as we've stated
here, we'll have difficulty adjustment and

135
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm working on this right now, but we'll
have demurrage in the Lithos testnet

136
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
client as well. For demurrage, it'll
automatically be collected by the Lithos

137
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
client, so there shouldn't be anything
that you need to do specifically. Just

138
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
watch out for it and make sure that things
are working smoothly.

139
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
For MEV and transaction selection, those
aren't our biggest priorities at the

140
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
moment. So they won't be integrated into
the UI and testnet, but theoretically, if

141
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
you wanted to, it's possible to manually
implement it. It's obviously completely

142
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
possible by the protocol. It's just not
supported by the UI yet.

143
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Thanks for watching guys. Hopefully
you're able to learn more about how to use

144
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Lithos for the upcoming testnet and maybe
you can play around with the difficulty

145
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
values there and see how mining on Lithos
feels compared to normal pools. Anyway, so

146
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
thanks, thank you again for watching and
keep updated with Lithos. We'll have more

147
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
news coming out soon about the testnet.
See you guys.
