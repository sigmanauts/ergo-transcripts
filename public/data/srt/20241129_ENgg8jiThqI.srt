1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello, happy Thanksgiving to all the USA
Sigmanauts.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
How you doing, kushti?

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Good morning.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Doing well.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hi, everyone.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Good time to share some updates, I guess,
and discuss some things in the AMA format.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It sure is, kushti.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah, so we are trying different formats.
That was a good community call.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That was fun, yeah, the Zoom call, yep.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah, a bit chaotic maybe, but yeah,
because for the first time I believe,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
there were a lot of opinions and people
willing to speak, so it lasted for one

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
hour and a half instead of one hour, or
maybe not really planned, but I don't

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
know. I had in mind something like that.
And then, yeah, well, there will be

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Twitter spaces tomorrow.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Do you know about that?

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Which one's that, kushti?

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
One with House of Chimera, so it will be
announced later today.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh, it's the other one you invited me to.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, so you will be there, supposedly.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Awesome.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, and Joe also will be there. So,
yeah, three of us will represent and

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
uncover Ergo to House of Chimera community
and also Ergo community is welcomed to

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
jump.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Awesome. I'll look for that announcement.
We'll retweet it, get it out there too.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
All right. Yeah. So we'll ask for an
announcement actually after the AMA. So

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
yeah, we are exploring different formats
with different entities around such as

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
House of Chimera, and there is one
proof-of-work merge mined Bitcoin

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
sidechain. We may have Twitter spaces.
Then, yeah, maybe some Ergo-only Twitter

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
space again, and then community calls. So
even the side of AMA, well, it's about

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
very tight schedule.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It seems before the new year if we are
targeting to have all of that, that's

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
about pretty tight schedule actually.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I heard some feedback online that CKB
wants to do another hosted space with us

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
as well kind of that space so we'll do
that at some point in the future this

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
year.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Maybe not this year, qx().

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah, because for this year, everything
is set probably already.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes. Well, maybe January then.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, cool beans. Well, what's new,
kushti?

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's a lot of new things, so finally
EIP-50 for 6.0 soft fork proposal

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
published, and the most, let's see,
understandable parts which are for general

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
public are also cross-published on the
forum. And then yeah so there's currently

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
just one pull request left and the first
round of reviewing already done so I'm

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
working on tests and I'm going to ping
miners to get good dates for start of

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
voting.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:34,000
As a reminder, Ergo is not centralized
cryptocurrency if such term makes sense at

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:47,000
all, controlled by dev team so every
change is to be voted by miners with 90

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:05:00,000
percent, 90 plus percent of hash rate
voting for is needed for approval.

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
kushti, can you explain briefly how that
works? Like you publish a new kind of

50
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
change code for the node and how
specifically do miners vote on that, just

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
for the people watching?

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, so basically they need to install
the latest version or a version of the

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
node which is supporting a new version of
the protocol. But then the voting is still

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
explicit. So they need to put concrete
value in settings, so they need to find

55
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
the voting section in the config file and
put certain value there because there is

56
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
no implicit voting. Before, there were
some pools which were asked for versions

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
of the node with implicit voting. When it
was 5.0, if my memory serves me well. They

58
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
did pre-voting, they didn't make a choice
until individually the miners voted on

59
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
their pool.

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Was it GetBlock that did that?

61
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So, GetBlock had the individual voting
for designers. Other pools just decided

62
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:30,000
whether to vote yes or no, and some asked
for a version with specific config, but

63
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
maybe after it was voted already to have
lock-in done. So I've forgotten actually

64
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:48,000
something like that. Well, in general, a
miner needs to put a vote for soft fork

65
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,000
explicitly.

66
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
For sure. And if some of the big pools or
the other pools, even small pools, don't

67
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
update their node to that, it's
essentially a totally different chain if

68
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
the soft fork goes through?

69
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's soft fork, so actually they will
continue to recognize blocks. They even

70
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
can mine blocks if we are talking about
upcoming soft forks. But there is a chance

71
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
that they can include invalid
transactions. So, well, 5.0 and actually

72
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
previous nodes will skip validations of
transactions with new features, 6.0

73
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
features. And then if 6.0 transaction is
invalid, for example, then there is a

74
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
chance that a miner not updated will mine
this invalid transaction and gets the

75
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
block rejected by 90% of the hash rate.

76
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's why voting is needed. You need to
be sure that even if all nodes are in the

77
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
network, they cannot mine invalid
transactions so that they cannot produce

78
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,000
long enough forks. That's why such big
numbers here in the wording for critical

79
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
things. Yeah, so there is forum posts
which is uncovering changes proposed such

80
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
as new features, opening possibilities for
actually a lot of applications, some

81
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
already shown such as trustless Bitcoin
bridge.

82
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Then Lithos, then yes, certain roll-up
constructions are shown to be feasible.

83
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Hash rate coin, so hash rate derivatives
would be feasible with 6.0. Yeah, well,

84
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,000
efficient at least, right, with 6.0.

85
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Cryptographic applications. There is an
unfinished example of a range proof

86
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
validation. I've assigned a bounty for
that issue. If you want to play with

87
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
cryptography, ErgoScript and also get some
bounty, consider to finish this example.

88
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's a bit tricky, but definitely from
what I've checked, I've made half of it

89
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and we found that the rest is using
basically the same operations which are

90
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
added along with a new unsigned big
integer type needed for cryptographic

91
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
applications along with modular
arithmetics.

92
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Well, another thing aside of new features
and so on is the possibility in the node

93
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
to vote for new parameters without
breaking previous versions of the nodes or

94
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
maybe versions of the nodes not
recognizing such voting, so you can do

95
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
maybe some velvet forking kind of voting
from 6.0. And in particular, 6.0 nodes

96
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
also do recognize a new parameter, which
is number of sub-blocks per block. So,

97
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
yeah, well, with it, this parameter can be
used further in the sub-blocks protocol to

98
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,000
have miners having possibility to readjust
a number of sub-blocks per block, which is

99
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:20,000
quite interesting, I believe, when miners
would be capable to change frequency of

100
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
sub-blocks' pulsation, let's say.

101
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
When should we start pushing this out on
socials to get at least the miners aware

102
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and the pool operators aware?

103
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Right now, so I mean, it's finalized and
so what's not finalized is activation

104
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,000
details for mainnet. And yeah, so for
public testnet, I think we can do

105
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:06,000
activation like two weeks, literally two
weeks. So the testnet is currently not

106
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
that stable. So yeah, but when it will
become... Oh, we've got it there. We're

107
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
just waiting for your note, I think. It's
mgPai myself. It's also Explorer, so I

108
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:30,000
need to check with them what's going on
with the Explorer notes.

109
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Right, you have to point testnet explorer
to the new testnet.

110
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, but the testnet explorer is looking
at mine's not. And then there is need to

111
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:56,000
fix things. Maybe your peers are burning
the notes. Let's see. But yeah, I guess

112
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:06,000
it's about one to two days anyway. And
then I need to do some more tests in the

113
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:16,000
form of codes and also manual tests in
DevNets.

114
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm running regularly 6.0 DevNets. Then
we'll propose public testnet activation

115
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and then at the same time we can talk with
miners about mainnet activation details.

116
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And as a reminder, after beginning of
voting at least three months would be

117
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:52,000
needed for activation. So first it would
be 32 epochs of 1024 blocks each for

118
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,000
voting and in case of supermajority
achieved not just supermajority and 90

119
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
plus percent - so supermajority is usually
associated with 66 percent plus and in

120
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:19,000
case of 90 plus percent support.

121
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:28,000
There is also a 32 epochs delay for
activation to give a possibility for

122
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:37,000
everyone to update. In total it's 64
epochs, 1024 blocks each, so about 3

123
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:46,000
months. Yeah and then we will have 6.0
activated and at the same time so during

124
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,000
those three months actually we can work on
sub-blocks because sub-blocks probably

125
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:04,000
would be deployed in a few steps and some
soft forkish update for miners would be

126
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:13,000
needed only at the last step, and they can
be deployed in kind of velvet fork way

127
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:22,000
before.

128
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So yeah, and it would be good to consider
what to do after, so basically from mid

129
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:45,000
2025 and so on. So already a lot of talks.
A lot of proposals were pushed, but there

130
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:56,000
is need to consider what to do and in what
form. So I think the general vector could

131
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:07,000
be to decentralize development more.
Definitely as communities also definitely

132
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:18,000
becoming more and more decentralized in
regards with every aspect we can think of.

133
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And then, yeah, so also, well, started,
so as I discussed, started Ergo book, and

134
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:40,000
now Joe is going also to contribute, so
hopefully some parts but I'm actually

135
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
thinking to publish like article by
article on the forums maybe the first

136
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:00,000
piece likely will be published this week
so just a few days after 6.0 proposal and

137
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,000
with Ergo book the idea is to get material
from different members of Ergo movement,

138
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Ergo community, will become leader,
conceptualizing what we do know about

139
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,000
cryptocurrencies as a form of money,
peer-to-peer networks and so on.

140
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And then how those concepts are realized
in Ergo, from philosophical aspects going

141
00:17:48,000 --> 00:18:03,000
to technical. And then going maybe deeper.
And then to get some picture of what Ergo

142
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:18,000
protocol and ecosystem around is about and
maybe trying to achieve.

143
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It looks like we got a sneaky guest when
you were talking, kushti.

144
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah, it's actually the spider that's
sitting on the wall there for the past

145
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
hour and a half. I don't like killing
spiders, so that guy's taking advantage of

146
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
the situation. So nice to see you, Charlie
Rose. AKA, qx().

147
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's great to see you too.

148
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Yeah. For those of you who are too young
to know this, so Charlie Rose is a

149
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
journalist and old school journalist. And
he would conduct all of his interviews

150
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
with a black background like this. It was
very, it was very much like his brand to

151
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
always interviews with this black
background. So that's why I keep calling

152
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
qx() Charlie Rose and he's just like
looking to be like, what?

153
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
No, I know Charlie Rose. Of course.

154
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Good. Because you make, give me this
blank face. Like I don't even know what

155
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
the hell anyway. Yeah. So, so, I mean, I
walked into this really interesting

156
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
conversation here. Now, you know, another
interesting conversation, actually you

157
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
mentioned Joe. And it just kind of, it's
kind of funny, you know, how narratives

158
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and how people just kind of jump into
these, like, I mean, I don't want to say

159
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
just pure hype because it is quite a bit
of interesting tech behind BitcoinOS.

160
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But, you know, the community and, you
know, our community as well as the Cardano

161
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
community, and of course, you know, the
communities are mixed, really jumped on

162
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
this, like BitcoinOS is going to bring so
much liquidity and it's just going to, you

163
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
know, just going to bring, it's going to
bring all of Bitcoin onto Cardano and

164
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Ergo, and it's just going to be awesome,
you know, we're just going to be swimming

165
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
in liquidity. It's going to be so liquid
out here. It's going to be like, you know,

166
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
like Solaris, like the ocean planet.

167
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah, and it could but, you know, Ergo
already made something like this that

168
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
works really, really well. It's called
Rosen Bridge. And I keep talking about it

169
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
on socials. And it's just interesting
that, you know, like, I mean, we do get

170
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
quite a bit of recognition for Rosen, I
think. Rosen is one of the more popular

171
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Ergo projects, I think, in the Ergo
Cardano ecosystem. You know, on Cardano,

172
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
many people know about Rosen versus, I
guess, you know, other projects that came

173
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
out of Ergo.

174
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Maybe, you know, Splash, you know, is one
that rivals the popularity of Rosen. But

175
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Rosen is this, you know, it's like pure
Ergo tech. And yeah, you know, I actually,

176
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I see this question down here. I don't
know if you guys are, yeah, well, Jumeis

177
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:39,000
telling us to better learn how to swim.
Yeah, it's good.

178
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Let's see. So Bobcat, and I think
actually Bobcat likes to ask this question

179
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
on every single AMA, at least that I've
been on, or maybe it's not Bobcat, maybe

180
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
it's somebody else, but we get this
question quite a bit, is actually I

181
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
selected it. I don't know. Can you guys
see it? I don't think you can see the

182
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
questions I selected. Can you see them?

183
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I got you.

184
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I put it there. Yeah, I don't know why I
can't see it. Okay, anyway. Yeah, no,

185
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
actually, I probably because I'm not
signed in. But anyway, select the one.

186
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Okay, well, actually, this one as well.
This one is interesting. But I was

187
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
actually going to go to the one that just
what are you looking towards in 2025?

188
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Bobcat asked that one.

189
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah. Well, so, but then we can go to the
BitcoinOS one because I actually, I'd like

190
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
to hear kushti's input on this and yours
too qx(). Okay. Don't feel like, you know,

191
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
in the conversation here. Okay. Yeah.
You're important too qx(). Okay. Don't

192
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
cry. Don't cry. Yeah, you know, what I'm
looking towards in 2025 is, you know, big

193
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
projects really realizing that it's
already here, it's already built. You

194
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
know, the tech is here. You know, there's
no new sensational type of thing. There's

195
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
like, oh my God, you know, this is going
to solve everything.

196
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's already here, but you have to start
utilizing. There has to be traffic. And I

197
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
think one of the big plays for 2025 would
be for some really nice, successful, and

198
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
successful dApps and platforms that have a
wide customer range, utilizing Rosen,

199
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
bringing Rosen just onto their stack and
utilizing it to serve between all these

200
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
different ecosystems. And now they got
runes, going to be bridging to Solana,

201
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
they're going to be bridging to
everywhere, bridging to the moon.

202
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
What was the newest one? I forgot, what
was the newest one for Rosen? What are

203
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
they going to be bridging to?

204
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
What's it called?

205
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Binance, BNB, or Dogecoin.

206
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Dogecoin and Binance, yeah, are the two
new ones.

207
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Doge, yeah, Doge and Binance. Anyway,
it's here. You know, the tech is here.

208
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's time to utilize it. And I think our
focus is, and I think what's going to

209
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
happen in 2025 is more and more projects
will realize that, well, wait a second. I

210
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
need to do this now. Who has the tech now?
Rosen has the tech now. Right now you can

211
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
do it right now. I can move assets between
Cardano and Ergo and I can move assets

212
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
between Bitcoin and Cardano and so on. I
can do it right now.

213
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And so that's why we're going to be
utilizing, with Paul Meyer, with Paul

214
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
McConaughey, we're going to be utilizing
Rosen, because we can do all this stuff.

215
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
We have the necessity to make it
cross-chain. We need to be able to move

216
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
these assets between Cardano, Ergo,
Bitcoin, EVM, because we actually have

217
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
some commitments to move some of this
stuff to EVM. And the tech is here, and

218
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
the tech is the most practical for it. So
it's all about really not just kind of

219
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
ringing the bell, look, here it is, but
actually getting these projects, the big

220
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
projects to look at it and say, hey, this
solution exists, we should utilize it, we

221
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
will utilize it, and getting to utilize
it.

222
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And that's what I see what is happening
in 2025. More and more projects really

223
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
kind of getting it. So, yeah, I just
wanted to go to that question because that

224
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
was really on my mind after all this
stuff, BitcoinOS, because, you know, I

225
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
mean, I guess, yeah, I mean, people want
to see liquidity, and you want to see

226
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
liquidity, you want to see, you know, life
on chain.

227
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And they think that, you know, Bitcoin
will bring that more of that life on

228
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
chain. Whether it will or won't remains to
be seen, but, you know, they think it

229
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
will, you know. Actually, I would like to
get kushti's, well, and yours qx(). Okay,

230
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
yours qx() and kushti's input on the
difference because I'm sure that people

231
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
have asked, how is it different? Is it the
same tech or is it different tech?

232
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So I don't know which one he wants to go
first, but maybe he should answer that.

233
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Right maybe. Sure, well first of all in
the social scene my tribute I attribute

234
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
that BitcoinOS hype and then pretty quick
what's the opposite of hype? I don't know

235
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
but that happened all in it like a week
drama drama on Twitter I attribute that to

236
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
you know, everything's experience of pump
Cardano and Ergo both recently and

237
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
experience quite a quite a pump in there
in their sex and their sex value at least.

238
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Everybody's frothing in the mouth and then
along comes this other promise of you know

239
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
the promise of more liquidity flowing in
and higher values there so people

240
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
immediately jump on the train for that
without even thinking or looking or

241
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
reading into it or anything and then they
come out with a they come up with, oh

242
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
yeah, we're going to fundraise here as a
token, and everybody's like, oh, that's

243
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
awful.

244
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You know, you guys are awful, that kind
of thing. So that was funny to watch with

245
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
popcorn from the sidelines, that's for
sure. But from what I understand, here,

246
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'll give my stupid explanation, and
kushti can correct everything that I'm

247
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
wrong. So, Rosen's a bridge, essentially.
You lock tokens on one side, you release

248
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
them on the other side. And Rosen's unique
and special because it uses this two-layer

249
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
approach with watchers and guards.

250
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Watchers first see the transaction,
report it, guards verify that transaction,

251
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
then do a consensus and release it on the
other side. There's never any minting of

252
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
tokens. It's not like a live mint. The
tokens, the supply is minted and locked

253
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
right off the bat. So there's no way you
can continuously leak and mint more tokens

254
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
on Rosen like that. Whereas BitcoinOS, I
believe, is more like a programmable

255
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
layer. I mean, it's its own thing where
you can have kind of trustless relays

256
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
like, I think kushti, you made one
recently as a proof of concept back in a

257
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
couple months ago to be able to report
transactions on another chain from

258
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Bitcoin.

259
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But that's my understanding of it.
kushti, please correct me.

260
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah, so you can use trustless relay to
bring Bitcoin to Ergo. But the other way,

261
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:45,000
it doesn't work because you cannot build
Ergo relay on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is too

262
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:54,000
limited for that so then you can do
different tricks such as BitcoinOS way to

263
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:03,000
verify ZK snarks. But, yeah, it's
complicated. And, yeah, it's not audited,

264
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:12,000
it's not well tested and so on. And it's
also not even quite new. So Bitcoin

265
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:21,000
community is considering using snarks in
Bitcoin along with Bitcoin scripts in form

266
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:30,000
of contingent payments, for example, since
2015, so the first presentation was done

267
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:39,000
at Financial Cryptography 2015.

268
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But then it's stuff quite complicated, so
the original scheme presented at Financial

269
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Cryptography 2015 was shown to be insecure
in some paper from 2017. That paper

270
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:10,000
proposed a fix, a paper by Alexander
Chiesa and others. I've forgotten its

271
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,000
name. But then the proposed fix even was
corrected in another follow-up paper. So,

272
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:26,000
yeah, and about this BitcoinOS, they wait
to optimistically verify snarks. Yeah, I

273
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:34,000
personally would wait for I don't know,
another five years to have dust settle

274
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,000
down around all that.

275
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I mean just from my observation of
previous attempts to build stuff like

276
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:04,000
that. Yes, so contingent payments were
used even in simpler context like, so the

277
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:14,000
original showcase was paid for Sudoku
solution, so payment for proving, for a

278
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:24,000
proof of some computationally hard
challenge solution. But, yeah, even in

279
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:34,000
that simple setting, things are quite
complicated and BitcoinOS is more

280
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:44,000
complicated and the white paper is not
that detailed, let's say. So it's just

281
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:54,000
very briefly touching details and
efficiency is not quite clear and then

282
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:04,000
execution in the presence of network
congestion and so on.

283
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And then about how all those things are
implemented from snarks to scripts,

284
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Bitcoin and what are possible attacks and
so on. So yeah, it's still not quite clear

285
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
to start with. And yeah, in the Rosen,
it's just a multisig on Bitcoin side. And

286
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
it's maybe not that fancy, but it's quite
clear how it's working, at least, on the

287
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Bitcoin side. And then on the Ergo side,
there is another layer of protection,

288
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
which is about watchers.

289
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And guards.

290
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Guards, but guards are co-signing on
Bitcoin?

291
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And in case of anything happening there,
so you have second layer on Ergo, second

292
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
layer.

293
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah.

294
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So, yeah, I mean, it's simple and working
at least.

295
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Speaking of Rosen Bridge, Armeanio and
the Rosen team are getting near their

296
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Hummingbot implementations, and they're
putting out a channel soon on Telegram and

297
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
they're going to use it as an educational
kind of thing where people come in, they

298
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
learn about it, they run it, they test it,
and they get very knowledgeable about how

299
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
to run your own hummingbot. I mean, that's
one of the things that I mean, everybody

300
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
wishes for some big angel to come in and
dump liquidity everywhere and trade

301
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
everywhere and hold our hands and make us
feel good like some savior or messiah. But

302
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
when it comes down to it, guys, it's us.

303
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Like we have the power to take, even if
you have like 200 ERGs, it doesn't matter.

304
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
grab this hummingbot, jump in the channel
when it's made, learn how to use it,

305
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
arbitrage across the ecosystems, across
exchanges, and make a couple ERGs along

306
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
the way, you know, just from running
something easily on your computer. And

307
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
that will provide liquidity, that'll help
provide liquidity across different

308
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
pockets, different enclaves, whether it be
Ethereum, Binance, Doge, Cardano, Bitcoin

309
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
anything like that, so it's up to us guys.

310
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I mean I feel like we're sitting
Sometimes I feel like we're sitting in

311
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
this advanced cathedral with all these
amazing scientific tools in front of us in

312
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
the year 4000. And we're sitting there
looking at these tools and being like, oh,

313
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
that's cool. Let's poke it. That's neat.
But when's somebody going to come along

314
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and build this for us and do this for us?
It's like, the tools are there, guys. We

315
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
have everything we need. And there's
plenty of us. There's 12-some thousand

316
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
people in the Telegram chat alone. There's
plenty of us to be able to pick up

317
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
something and use it and make a
difference.

318
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So, I mean, we're talking hundreds of
people run these hummingbots for Rosen

319
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Bridge with their implementation of it,
and you're going to see a big difference

320
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
in liquidity across exchanges and DEXs.
Yeah, so watch out for that guys. Please

321
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
join the telegram chat when Rosen Bridge
sets it up Don't be afraid to jump in

322
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
there and use hummingbot Ask questions.
I'm available for I'll be running one I

323
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
just got some loose ERGs from a
reimbursement for running some servers. So

324
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I have those I can put in and We can
provide liquidity across the spectrum

325
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
guys. So don't be afraid We're here to
hold each other's hands.

326
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You're that liquidity provider that's
going to just come and provide liquidity

327
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
everywhere.

328
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
No, I just... I only have like 300 ERGs.

329
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Just go around and liquidity everything.

330
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I only have like 300 ERGs, but I'll put
it all towards HummingBot. No problem.

331
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah, 300 ERGs times 300.

332
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
No, no, everything else is in ecosystem
projects.

333
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I also think to provide some more
liquidity. Yeah, it seems there are some

334
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,000
options which are not realized yet. Even
SigmaUSD to Dexy Gold liquidity pool. But

335
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,000
yeah, it's very natural, I guess,
liquidity pool to profit from arbitrage.

336
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Because, depending on crypto market
conditions, you have independent movements

337
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:54,000
of gold price against USD.

338
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's kind of crypto-independent way to
profit from arbitrage. And yeah, it's

339
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:14,000
still not there, surprisingly. So yeah,
well, I will do that. So I even tried, but

340
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:23,000
got some errors before because of
something with Spectrum DEX chainbots.

341
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:32,000
There was something when trying to create
liquidity pools on certain clients, but

342
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:41,000
yeah, well now it's probably resolved. So
yeah, need to try again.

343
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:54,000
All right, what else we got here? All
right. Well, yeah, we actually got a so

344
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:03,000
this is a actually a term that's been
floating around We would love we love to

345
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:12,000
say demurrage The mirage. The mirage.
Yeah. Yeah. So we'd love to use the word

346
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:21,000
the mirage, but I think a lot of people
are missing context here. So why don't you

347
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:30,000
qx() explain this like you would to a five
year old.

348
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Awesome. Demurrage to a five-year-old.
Let's see. Demurrage, well, first of all,

349
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
demurrage is one of the coolest things
about Ergo. Super, super cool. It's also

350
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
one of the most misunderstood things about
Ergo when people come in. So explaining

351
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
like a five-year-old. Okay. Let's see.
Okay, let's say that the five-year-old has

352
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
a bunch of toys. And you like to play with
your toys. You have your trains, you have

353
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
your Legos, you have everything. All
right.

354
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
So, you put those toys in, every time you
put it away, you put it in a little

355
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
baggie, and you throw it in your little
protective coating, and you throw it in

356
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
your chest, your box outside. All right,
every time you want to play with it or do

357
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
it, you have to get it out of that little
baggie, play with it, put it back in the

358
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
little baggie and set it there. But let's
say you don't play with toys for quite a

359
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
while. They take up space in that chest
and it's hard for your dad to move that

360
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
chest around and put it in the basement or
put it upstairs for you and do that. So it

361
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
gets heavier and heavier and heavier.

362
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So, what you can do to help prevent that,
there are two things. You can either take

363
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
all the toys out and put them in one bag
and maybe store that bag in an easier

364
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
place. And then there's more room in the
chest. Or you can, your dad can get really

365
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
pissed at you for having so many toys. And
he can take a few of those toys in the

366
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
small bags that you haven't touched in a
long, long time and essentially throw them

367
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
out. So that's maybe a five-year-old could
understand that. I don't know. That may

368
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
have been too simply and missing a little
bit of the point. But here's a

369
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
12-year-old's explanation.

370
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So blockchains get bloat. We know that
from watching other chains who lost their

371
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
history and struggling to find it and
chains that get massively bloated. And

372
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
bloat leads to centralization. You have
Solana nodes that are so massive and

373
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
require so much throughput that people are
running them in centralized clusters like

374
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
in Amazon or Azure. So that is not
decentralized. That's not somebody like

375
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Dan or kushti or myself who could just
spin up a node in our basement or on our

376
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
spare computer. So keeping a node pruned
and small is going to encourage

377
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
decentralization on small devices.

378
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,000
OK, so in order to do that, Ergo in the
base code says that, hey, if you have

379
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,000
these boxes, where UTXO, so every
transaction into your wallet goes in its

380
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,000
own little box, you can never add to that
box. If you want to use the tokens in that

381
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,000
box, you have to spend the box, which then
takes money and puts it in somebody else's

382
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,000
wallet in a box and brings a change back
to your little another new box in your

383
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,000
thing all right so in order to make sure
the blockchain is small excuse me anything

384
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
after four years of just sitting there not
doing anything and when i say four years i

385
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
mean four years in block time Just sitting
there not doing anything will be able to

386
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
allow to be collected a small amount of
rent from it all right and what this does

387
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
is if not necessarily it's two factor
right you're collecting rent from people

388
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,000
who aren't doing anything who are just
storing things on chain and not moving it

389
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,000
around so it could be a miner that has 10
000 boxes of one ERG that they've been

390
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,000
mining for a long you know and just
sitting there for four years.

391
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Or it could be dust from something,
airdrop, or tokens that were distributed,

392
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
or even a miner that just has too much of
a too small ERG sitting around. Okay, so

393
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
that takes a bloat on the blockchain. So
demurrage, at that point, if the amount of

394
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
ERG in the box is too small for the rent
cost, the whole box is taken and

395
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
destroyed. So now we've cleaned up the
chain of all this dust that's just out

396
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
there. That amount is called storage rent.
It goes to the people mining it. They can

397
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
wrap it in a transaction and spend it and
bring it to the mining pool or the person

398
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
mining it.

399
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
If there's enough ERG to cover that rent,
then the box is just recreated with a

400
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
change with the storage rent taken out of
it and it's put back there. But overall

401
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
goal. ELI 12 is that It's meant to prevent
bloat on a blockchain which helps with

402
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
decentralization essentially My wife just
brought me a sandwich Look at that

403
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
homemade bacon egg sandwich guys Are you
gonna storage rent that sandwich?

404
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It's gonna take some storage rent off it
right now guys Yeah, you're gonna take

405
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
storage rent.

406
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Oh, you're actually going to eat while
you're doing an AMA. You, you college

407
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
student.

408
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
People get afraid, people get afraid of
demurrage or storage rent because they're

409
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
like somebody's taking stuff from my
wallet. I hear a lot of FUD sometimes from

410
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
like two specific people on Twitter.
That's like, Oh, I don't like Ergo because

411
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
the devs can just take all my money. What
they don't understand is that you need a

412
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
90% consensus to do any sort of that kind
of change in that consensus mechanism

413
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
there to do that absolutely insane
thought. I mean, why would miners vote

414
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
against their own interests to be able to
rape everybody's wallet that way? It makes

415
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
no sense.

416
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:09,000
FUD in misunderstandings. It's one of the
best tools out there for a chain to reduce

417
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:17,000
bloat. I know, kushti, you said Ethereum
had thought about it for a while or

418
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:25,000
somebody other chains have thought about
implementing in a while, but...

419
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yeah, so actually Ethereum community
started to discuss storage rent and

420
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,000
actually the term was taken from the
Ethereum community, not demurrage, which

421
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:46,000
is well known in the theory of money and
economics, but storage rent, so it was

422
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,000
taken from the Ethereum community and
they've been discussing it since 2015

423
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:00,000
actually. Because it's quite clear that,
you know, it's not fair and quite a broken

424
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,000
economy in Ethereum. Yeah, also Bitcoin
and basically every blockchain when you

425
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,000
can create some object on the blockchain
such as unspent outputs or smart contract

426
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,000
in case of Ethereum and so on and then it
lives forever so it lives on thousands of

427
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:28,000
computers in peer-to-peer network but it's
been paid once and then living forever,

428
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:35,000
which is totally unrealistic and also
unfair.

429
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,000
There is no example, I believe, where you
can pay once for storage and then occupy

430
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:52,000
it forever. It's simply contra-economical.
And yeah, also, when we are talking about

431
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:59,000
real-world assets such as gold, any
commodity, so you are paying for storage,

432
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:06,000
it's basically the same. There is some
cost to hold your gold. A brick of gold in

433
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,000
a gold vault. To store any commodity you
have in a warehouse, such as, I don't

434
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:20,000
know, wheat, coffee, whatever. So you need
to pay for storage. The same in the

435
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,000
digital world. So you're occupying bytes
on the thousands of machines, bytes of

436
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:34,000
their memory, then you are not paying
anything.

437
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Yeah, in Ethereum it's even worse because
that smart contract is living forever,

438
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:56,000
it's occupying memory, some critical
indices and so on. Then they will ask for

439
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:04,000
using suicide command. There is such
instruction when contract is not needed.

440
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:12,000
You can free. You can mark that it's not
used anymore and free memory basically.

441
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:20,000
But as you need to pay a gas for such
command, it's not being used. So it's like

442
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:28,000
a nice command in Linux. So it's nice, but
no one is using it.

443
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And then, yeah, that nonsense about devs
capable to charge, I don't know, that's

444
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:46,000
completely nonsensical. So in comparison
with all the proof-of-work

445
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:53,000
cryptocurrencies, but Bitcoin actually,
it's harder in Ergo, because, well, again,

446
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:00,000
90% voting is... Well, it's not even
possible with soft fork. So you need to do

447
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:07,000
hard fork, because I don't see any way to
do this soft fork. Well, as we are not

448
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:14,000
doing, we are avoiding hard forks,
especially such controversial. I mean,

449
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:21,000
it's the least issue in Ergo in comparison
with other proof-of-work currencies, but

450
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Bitcoin, because I'm not aware about
changing protocol by avoiding anywhere,

451
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:35,000
but Bitcoin and Ergo.

452
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Because in Ethereum, it always was about
dev's team setting something in the code

453
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,000
and then just ordering miners to update
the nodes and participate in that. Or

454
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:56,000
else. Yeah, so in that way they even fired
miners after all. But the same is all

455
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:03,000
other proof-of-work blockchains. So it's
usually about developers just providing a

456
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:10,000
new version and telling miners to install
it. And that's why it actually was quite

457
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:17,000
hard to work with miners on all that stuff
voting and so on to ask them to provide

458
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:24,000
the information and then wait for the
action because usually you know what they

459
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:31,000
do expect is basically the same as
happening everywhere so developers just

460
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,000
coming and providing a new version and
they're just running a new version of node

461
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:45,000
software for another shitcoin you know
without thinking much for what's going on

462
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:52,000
there.

463
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I mean, who cares about some shitcoin,
you know, and what's happening there. I

464
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:22,000
mean, the only reason for them, for
miners, for mining pool to be there is

465
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:33,000
just to mine and then dump and then jump
on another ASIC, mining Bitmain controlled

466
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:44,000
shitcoin. And so, yeah, I mean, because of
that attitude, it's quite hard to push

467
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:55,000
miners to make decisions about what stuff
they're working on so that's quite weird

468
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:06,000
so when you push people around to get more
power, usually people are grabbing power.

469
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And here is the opposite situation.

470
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I think anybody looking on from the
outside to the in would see demurrage

471
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
storage rent as proof that Ergo has been
created and thought of for the long term

472
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
and sustainability. So that's my number
one thought when I think of storage rent

473
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
and when I talk to other people about it.
If you're serious into crypto and you see

474
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
it as a financial power tool for the
individual, and you look at how these

475
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
things were built and thought of, you look
at Ethereum and you're like, how the fuck

476
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
is this supposed to sustain for this
thing, or Solana even? My goodness,

477
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
they're going to have countries running
these nodes kind of thing.

478
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
And you look at Ergo and you're like,
this was really thought out, and this was

479
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
thought out for sustainability, this was
thought out for decentralization, and

480
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
storage rent just proves that right there,
right off the bat, that that was the case.

481
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Yeah, actually, I love that cathedral
analogy very much, and also, well,

482
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:17,000
thoughts about writing a text on that,
because cathedrals considered as example

483
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:25,000
of something, well, thoughts. I believe
Linux community maybe is using the same

484
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:33,000
analogy, but need to check actually. So
it's something when you can build for

485
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:41,000
centuries and you are not breaking what
was built before. You are just building

486
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:49,000
new parts nearby and connecting with
existing parts and with centuries it's

487
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:57,000
becoming even more solid and even more
beautiful.

488
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So yeah, that's what should be the goal
here. So building a cathedral, not

489
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:17,000
speculative spec mining or whatever
speculative one-day story. So that was the

490
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:27,000
goal always implicitly. But yeah, maybe
there is need to also somehow explicitly

491
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:37,000
state it at some point, I believe.

492
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
All right, Dan, what else we have? Is
there any other questions that pique your

493
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
interest?

494
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Yeah, let's do one more. So this is
actually, you know, I think this kind of

495
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,000
aligns well with what you were saying
about, you know, the 90% of the time it

496
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
works every time with the devs. So here's
a question. Bitcoin is not set in stone

497
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
for max supply. Do you think Ergo max
supply will ever get voted to change?

498
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Well, so let's start with can it be voted
to change? Can it?

499
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Not quite, actually, because it's not
part of the protocol even. It's not a

500
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:30,000
token. Ergo emission is set in the form of
contract. Other cryptocurrencies, you

501
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:40,000
cannot just change some constant in the
code, like, for example, Ravencoin did,

502
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Ethereum did. And many cryptocurrencies
actually did. So here you need to somehow

503
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:00,000
change how contracts are executed and
change, I don't know, in a very deep way.

504
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:10,000
So it would be harder than in Bitcoin,
definitely.

505
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:20,000
But even in Bitcoin, as far as I know,
they are considering very tricky ways to

506
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:28,000
bypass emissions. There are different
proposals, but all of them are doing some

507
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:36,000
tricky things to avoid breaking
everything. So, and in Ergo, yeah, the

508
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:44,000
first question is whether it's needed at
all, considering that there is storage

509
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:52,000
rent. So maybe, yeah, if storage rents in
like 20 years wouldn't play out that well

510
00:55:52,000 --> 00:56:00,000
to provide enough rewards, or if there
will be problem with smoothness of rewards

511
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:08,000
and so on, maybe it would be better to
tweak storage rent like was already

512
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:16,000
proposed by a community member to put
storage rent to some pool and then pay

513
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:24,000
from that pool, like from emission
contracts, so just pay certain fixed

514
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:32,000
amounts of per block.

515
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:49,000
There are also proposals to have
automatic auctions for tokens collected.

516
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:59,000
And then, yeah, well, put ERGs raised from
auctions to the same pool, for example.

517
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:09,000
There are different DeFi tools for
financial schemes, which can be used to

518
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:19,000
provide smooth rewards to miners when
emission is out. Storage rent probably

519
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:29,000
would provide enough, especially
considering tokens and so on, in like 20

520
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:39,000
years when the emission will be finished.

521
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:53,000
But, yeah, in case of any issues here,
because it's hard to plan such things in

522
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:02,000
the first place. You don't know what will
happen with UTXO state in 20 years. And,

523
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:11,000
yeah, in this case, there are many tools,
like repurposing storage rent so instead

524
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:20,000
of miners just charging it send it to some
pool which is paying miners a fixed amount

525
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:29,000
of ERG per block doing those auctions well
storage rent parameters can be changed but

526
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:38,000
only within some range so miners cannot
raise storage rent significantly, the

527
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:47,000
maximum rate is just 2x of default current
value. And so on. So there is enough

528
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:56,000
tooling to avoid doomsday scenario which
is about changing emission I believe but

529
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:05,000
there are different opinions here for sure
so Ethereum guys changed emission I don't

530
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:14,000
know two or three times already and
probably will do for more but to me it's

531
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:23,000
you know, a very critical thing which
shouldn't be changed because when you

532
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:32,000
change such things as total supply, then
you're kind of breaking markets around,

533
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:41,000
which are already operating on well known
public information about emission.

534
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And that's what makes cryptocurrency is
beautiful. So you have perfectly known

535
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:56,000
public information about total emission,
emission schedule and so on. And so when

536
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:03,000
you're breaking such things, it's not that
good story. It could be needed maybe in

537
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:10,000
some cases and some communities decided to
change emission. Monero, for example,

538
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:17,000
introduced tail emission, and then
Ethereum changed the reward per block a

539
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:24,000
few times. But yeah, it's better to avoid
such things at all costs.

540
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Right. I mean, it's changing the
assumptions of a chain. I look at it the

541
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:41,000
same way as other chains who are talking
about implementing storage rent. You're

542
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:47,000
changing the assumptions and agreements
when miners started mining your chain and

543
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:53,000
started, or users started utilizing your
chain. You're changing all the agreements

544
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:59,000
on the smart contracts written that don't
take into account any sort of future

545
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:05,000
storage rent or anything like that. So
it's a huge, huge like rug pull, I would

546
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,000
say, on those members.

547
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Yeah, so in Ergo, it's there since day
one, so if you ever used Ergo, you've

548
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:25,000
agreed to storage rent already. And yeah,
it's not changed. Even parameters are

549
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:31,000
still the same as five years ago. But
yeah, if you are going to introduce

550
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:37,000
storage rent to a blockchain which doesn't
have it, then it's also a huge deal. It's

551
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:43,000
breaking a lot of things on many levels.
But yeah, so in the Bitcoin community,

552
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
there are discussions about the
possibility to introduce storage rent now.

553
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Maybe the next civil war in the Bitcoin
community would be about that. So what

554
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:01,000
would be about? So like previous one was
about just one constant block size.

555
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Whether to set it to 2 megabyte, 4
megabyte, 8 megabyte, unlimited size, do

556
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:13,000
what's Bitcoin core. Did some magic with
Segwit and so on.

557
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:26,000
So yeah, then the next civil war could be
about what to do with emission or storage

558
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:36,000
rent or tail emission. Introducing
changing emission schedule basically by

559
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:46,000
introducing tail emission. Or just leave
things intact. Yeah, there are maybe other

560
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:56,000
options. So yeah, the next civil war
probably could be about that.

561
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
No, we don't need no civil war.

562
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Yeah, but in Ergo, actually, one of the
motivation to have for all those warnings

563
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:10,000
for parameter block size for that sort of
for capability was to avoid civil wars in

564
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:16,000
the Ergo community. So, well, if you don't
like block size, then just reach miners

565
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:22,000
and tell them towards maybe they will
listen to you. Maybe not, but there is no

566
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:28,000
need for drama in the community, so just
work with miners and try to change the

567
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:34,000
protocol in the way you like. I mean, it's
always possible and no one is preventing

568
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,000
that. But also there is no need to push
others to do changes you would like to

569
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,000
have.

570
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:01,000
So just work on your own or find friends
and work with them.

571
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Dan, you've been very quiet and Wombo's
noticed that. I think you have a question

572
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
right here. Wombo's got a question. Dan,
could you speak a bit about your video on

573
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Catamarca Lithium Facility?

574
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Yeah. Well, I can speak a lot about it.
And I think he said a little bit, a little

575
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:29,000
bit, Danny said, yeah, a little, a lot of,
a little, I'll speak a lot about it in the

576
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:35,000
coming days. I'm actually going to
Argentina on Sunday again for two weeks

577
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:41,000
this time. And so there's actually going
to be a continuation of this work. But, it

578
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:47,000
was an interesting experience, very
interesting. It's one of those things

579
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:53,000
where you talk about all these things that
we can do with blockchain, especially in

580
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:59,000
an RWA sector and IoT, RWA and
traceability and all this stuff.

581
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:09,000
And then you go there and you see that
they need it. I mean, bad. It's a huge

582
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:15,000
facility and You know, it makes, I mean,
the thing, I think they put like a billion

583
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:21,000
dollars into it or something like that.
It's some obscene amount of money. And

584
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:27,000
there are such inefficiencies and not just
there. I mean, it's just in general,

585
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:33,000
there's such inefficiency, such
opaqueness. And it hurts, it hurts the

586
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,000
production. I mean, it hurts profits
because opaqueness is bad for efficiency.

587
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,000
And when you don't have efficiency, you
get bad ROI. You can get more ROI.

588
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:55,000
And yeah, just seeing all this really can
open my eyes even more to the fact that

589
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:01,000
this could all be, like Winter Protocol,
for example, again, built on Ergo, for

590
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:07,000
those of you who still don't know, because
every couple of weeks I'll get one of

591
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:13,000
those questions where people will ask me,
so are you building anything on Ergo? Like

592
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:19,000
we literally built everything on Ergo so
far, like literally the whole platform is

593
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:25,000
on Ergo so far. So yeah, kushti knows
because kushti has seen it, you know.

594
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Yeah, I mean, I'm reviewing contracts
currently and yeah, they're definitely on

595
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Ergo. I mean, my eyes, yeah, I mean, the
work more or less. So, yeah, it's

596
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:43,000
definitely about Ergo.

597
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
So, you know, and going there and seeing
how we can really help the real world with

598
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Ergo tech, I mean, that is, I mean, to me,
that is actually just really cool and

599
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,000
validating, you know, it's kind of
validates the whole thing that we are on

600
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
the right track. So yeah, there's going to
be a lot more actually coming out from

601
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
there in the next week or so. You'll see
we got a big unveiling happening next

602
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,000
week. So again, this is another asset that
can be potentially that will be utilizing

603
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Ergo for tokenization.

604
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:32,000
So yeah, yeah, it's just it was a very
interesting experience and I hope to And I

605
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,000
know we will have an impact over there
with the technology and with what we have

606
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:44,000
to offer.

607
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
So that was a little bit. That was a good
ELI response.

608
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Yeah, I hope that was a little enough of
bit.

609
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Perfect. Oh, we got another question. I
want to answer this one. What would you

610
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,000
guys do when Ergo hits $50? Happy
Thanksgiving. So personally, you'd see no

611
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
change for me. I'd still be doing
everything that I'm doing here. All my

612
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Ergo and project tokens would still be
sitting in my wallet. It would make no

613
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
difference to me. What it would make a
difference to is the Sigmanauts Treasury,

614
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
allowing us to have more reach, have more
function, have more, be able to hire more

615
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
people, be able to do more promotions. It
would turn our, you know, literally what,

616
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
50 times our treasury.

617
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So that'd be amazing for the Sigmanauts
Treasury, the decentralized DAO there in

618
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
our outreach and our ability to function.
Personally, it'd make no difference in my

619
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
daily function here at all. So I don't
know about you guys If you're bringing you

620
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
bring you sandwiches during during AMAs My
wife brings me sandwiches at a dollar 50

621
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,000
or a dollar 70 dollar 85 My wife will
bring me sandwiches at 50 dollars,

622
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,000
correct?

623
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:05,000
All right, so for me probably, well, just
remembering when it was about 20, so

624
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:12,000
probably my ass would be grilled a lot
around those days because yeah, I mean

625
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:19,000
during price appreciation. Yeah, you just
have more issues to resolve and also

626
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:26,000
communication channels are getting busier
and busier, you know, so like...

627
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Oh, the social, yeah.

628
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Yeah, well, not social, I mean, a lot of
people are reaching to DMs, so, well,

629
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:44,000
yeah, I don't know, so, back in 2020.
Yeah, it was kind of a disaster, but yeah,

630
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I mean, just recently I found some
messages, not from $20 a day, but later

631
01:09:52,000 --> 01:10:00,000
during the Ethereum merge. You know, Ergo
is invited to get listed on some exchange,

632
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:08,000
but yeah, there is need to discuss some, I
don't know. And yeah, it's for free, but

633
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:16,000
there is need for some marketing budget,
you know.

634
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:22,000
It's free, but... Yeah.

635
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Central machines are the Rumpelstiltskins
of the world.

636
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Yeah, I just discovered that, I don't
know, weeks ago, so two years after, so

637
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:40,000
yeah, and I guess if it would be 50, then
yeah, Telegram would be not quite usable

638
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:47,000
because of such wonderful offers to
discuss anything with 100 exchanges and

639
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:54,000
marketing agencies and whoever. Then a lot
of new developers willing to come and just

640
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:01,000
sending you DMs for some reason, instead
of, I don't know, reading documentation

641
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:08,000
around and so on. Maybe reach public chat.
So yeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure that,

642
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:15,000
yeah, the ass will be grilled a lot.
Simply.

643
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:25,000
But yeah, I mean, that's part of life.

644
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Yeah. I you know, I mean nothing would
would change except for You know have some

645
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:39,000
gold chains i'd be sitting in my own jet
You know, of course a couple more wives a

646
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:46,000
couple more wives I hope your wife's
asleep right now Yeah, she's not I would

647
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:53,000
be sending question pizzas with
questionable topics to qx()'s house COD

648
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Yeah, I mean that's that's about it Yeah,
I get I get kushti a wireless version of

649
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:07,000
those headphones.

650
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Oh That's nice. Yeah. Yeah, that's
Everybody knows why it is better than why

651
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:21,000
it is much better

652
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,000
If you say so grandpa, anyway, yeah.
Well, anyway, I think this is a good place

653
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,000
to leave it off. So everybody's, you know,
we're, we're, we're, we're full answering,

654
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:36,000
you know, bull, bull questioning. So yeah.
Um, good AMA guys. Um, well, good AMA

655
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,000
kushti. Okay. I'll take them. Okay. Yeah,
you know, it's like, it's like if you

656
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
share that sandwich, it would have been
better, but you can't and you won't. Don't

657
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,000
forget guys anyway guys everybody who
celebrates happy happy thanksgiving out

658
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,000
here we don't celebrate so they but but
they did in the in recent in in recent

659
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
years they have assimilated the commercial
side of thanksgiving black friday so now

660
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,000
we actually have black friday in japan but
no thanksgiving just black friday people

661
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,000
die like they do in the u.s black fridays

662
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Not like that, but you know, they do.

663
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:29,000
But actually, we have this. So Black
Friday is kind of like, you know, the

664
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Japanese retailers. Oh, Black Friday. Oh,
people are buying lots of stuff. We make

665
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:43,000
two. You know, it's like, it was like, but
actually out here we have a, so on January

666
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:50,000
1st, they're always, it's called
Fukubukuro. So it's basically like a gift

667
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:57,000
bag and all these stores have these
special fukubukuro which is basically like

668
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:04,000
something that's I don't know, like
limited edition or super cheap or

669
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:11,000
something like that.

670
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
So you have that in the U.S. with Black
Friday where people line up at like 2 a.m.

671
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
to get like $100, 50 inch TV or something
like that. Out here, they have the same

672
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
thing. They line up for these fukubukuro
from all these stores and they'll spend

673
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
like 200 bucks on fukubukuro and
supposedly it's like all this stuff that's

674
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
worth like a thousand bucks or something
and it's always limited. So we already

675
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
have that, but now we have Black Friday,
but we don't have Turkey. Except for

676
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Costco and then the problem with Costco
turkeys is that most Japanese houses don't

677
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
have ovens and you can't fit a turkey in a
conventional oven.

678
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
So like I always, I always see them and
they're expensive as shit too. They're

679
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
about like 60, 70 bucks.

680
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
That's why you deep that deep fry that
stuff out on your front yard or the

681
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
sidewalk.

682
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Yeah, well, you know, I think my
neighbors would have something to say

683
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,000
about that but Yeah, it's yeah, it's an
interesting experience. So like I said

684
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Everybody happy Thanksgiving for those who
celebrate for those who don't celebrate

685
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,000
happy whatever Yeah, and so until next
time same place same channel same people

686
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Friday is coming, right?

687
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Tomorrow Friday.

688
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Yeah. Yeah, that's that tomorrow. Yeah
tomorrow

689
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Yeah, so Black Friday is everywhere here
as well. But yeah, I mean, now it's going

690
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:41,000
to be quite strange because it seems that
the whole November is now going to be

691
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Black Friday because some sellers are
starting sales.

692
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
This is something they do. This is
something that you can get on black friday

693
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
actually I was digging the reason why I
got the blur background on here is because

694
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
my sugar gliders, Went loose in my room
and just like trashed it So but wait, how

695
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,000
does a five ounce?

696
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
How does a five ounce animal trash your
room dan?

697
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:16,000
indeed indeed i mean the thing is as big
as a hamster four of them like and i came

698
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:22,000
in here i'm like what the hell happened
like what happened in here it looks like a

699
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:28,000
freaking cheetah went loose in here it
just it was crazy so i haven't had a

700
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:34,000
chance to clean it up that's why but in
the process for some reason i now remember

701
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,000
that i have it i found this so this is the
soviet medal of labor It was given to only

702
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:46,000
the finest factory workers of the Soviet
Union.

703
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Wow. Where'd you get it from? Okay.

704
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:59,000
So I got it from Georgia, actually. I was
thinking about it. It's randomly in a bag

705
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:05,000
with a little booklet, with a little
Soviet booklet. Yeah. Oh, wait. Yeah,

706
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:11,000
there it is. Yeah. It says veteran of
labor on it. And so this is from the 80s,

707
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:17,000
actually. I bought it in Georgia, in
Tbilisi, years ago. And so I found this.

708
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:23,000
So if you work hard enough, maybe someday
you'll have this. But for the time being,

709
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I am keeping this medal.

710
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
You should put it up on the, you should
put it up on the MewFinance physical NFT

711
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
site and sell it.

712
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
There we go.

713
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
You know what? Speaking of that, maybe,
maybe if you guys are lucky and you check

714
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
out MewFinance tomorrow, maybe you'll see
some black Friday deals on a few token

715
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
packs. Maybe if I remember from
Sigmanauts, my own thing, I'll put some up

716
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
there. Let me, let me shake my loose
wallets and we'll see what's in there.

717
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Maybe I can sell some discounted project
tokens.

718
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Right. All right. All right. Well, maybe
I think maybe it's time to go. So I guess,

719
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
yeah, same time, same place, same channel.

720
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Don't forget the spaces tomorrow with
House of Chimera. And we'll announce that

721
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:22,000
on Twitter in a bit as soon as we see it.
Yeah. Going to get details. Yeah. It will

722
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:28,000
be announced once I've got them.
