1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
All right, Mark, what's happening, man?

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey, tim.erg.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah, I'm doing pretty well. Beautiful
weather out here in Colorado. How about

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
yourself?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm doing well. I've been super busy.
Just moved back to New Mexico a little

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
while ago, so still organizing my life.
But overall, pretty good, brother.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Nice, nice. Yeah, I'm about to move. I
just packed everything up in the pod.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
About to ship that off here today to
Florida. I'm about to be in it.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah, dude. We got some cool stuff going
on around ERG. I see we got a hackathon

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
coming up. You want to talk about that a
little bit? I don't actually know that

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
much about it. I haven't had time.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah, certainly. So there's the, I think
it's the ErgoHack 9. It is on enhancing

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
user experience and user experience
innovations and UX. This is really

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
confusing to read, sorry. Enhancing user
experience innovations in UI, UX and

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
mining. I think it's because it has user
experience in there twice with the UX.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's in any case. So whether you are UI
and UX designer, front end developer,

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
blockchain enthusiast or mining expert,
this event offers the chance to

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
collaborate, learn and create. And so
yeah, highly, highly recommend, even if

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
it's just like sort of a white paper,
putting some ideas on paper. I think it's

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
great to get feedback. It looks like
there's a schedule this time to where

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
there's going to be a workshop, several
workshops. So workshop on the first day,

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
seems like every day in between, even some
Q and A, whereas I don't think that's been

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
the case before. That's great.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I like the workshop idea. So that's just
like how the community is, right? It's

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
like, people just, if someone's willing to
work on something and learn, everyone will

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
help you kind of do it.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, totally. I mean, you just got to
show the initiative because I mean, I

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
think oftentimes someone would be like,
hey, I have this cool idea. Let me hand it

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
off to you. And it's like, dude, people
are already working on stuff. So it's

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
like, and maybe you don't have time and
that's fine, right? But if you do have

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
time and it is your idea, maybe there
needs to be some more pillars, right? To

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
help support you and the community will
come in and do that, right? They've done

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
that with me for sure. And then from
there, you can kind of have your own

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
support and then kind of go on your own
sort of, whatever you're trying to do.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Like me and Tim, I talked to Tim yesterday
about creating a dApp. And so yeah, I

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
think the Ergo hacks are great, great
opportunity for people to kind of just to

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
figure out the ecosystem to one, be able
to ask for help because the whole event is

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
to sort of do development. And so it's a
perfect opportunity to be able to ask for

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
help and to get help.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, that's cool. And I think UI UX is a
really good place for us to invest some

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
time and energy. I'm just imagining some
of the dApps are like, the bones are

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
there. It's really cool. But yeah, just to
take that next level. I'm just thinking of

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
just the ones I've used the most like
DuckPools is like almost there. It's the

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
dApp side into the back end. It's working.
And then just like that next little level

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
to make us on par with really the top top
chains.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What do they have exactly? Sorry, not to
cut you off. But what do they have?

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Because I always hear that, oh, well, the
Ergo dApps, they don't have the user

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
interface or the user experience that
we're kind of used to. Like, can you

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
explain what is sort of like the vibe and
feel that when people say that, what are

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
we talking about, I guess, in more like
words?

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah, sure. So, okay, I will preface this
by saying, I think DuckPools is awesome.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And I don't mean this to be like any
cutting criticism. But so things I've seen

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
before is just like, really clear
indication of when I might be liquidated.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And just little things like that, or I've
seen... There was one app called Balancer

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
on Ethereum, and I thought this was really
cool. It was like, you could just create

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
your own pool, and it's more than just two
coins. So you could set up a whole

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
portfolio. I want 15% this, 20% that, and
just build the whole pool. And that will

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
maintain your the proportion of all your
positions and then route trades through

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
your pool to help balance that as prices
change. Which is sick. And so but just

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
like setting it up was just very, very
easy. And I was able to get more

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
information about my positions.

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Gotcha. Okay, so kind of like an
understanding of like what it's doing, why

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
it's doing it, and then like maybe why you
would want to do it. I kind of, I guess

64
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
less of like clicking buttons, I guess,
right?

65
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah, yeah, just like a polished
dashboard. And I felt like I had all the

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
information that I needed to make
decisions right away. And I guess I

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
wouldn't say that's true of everything in
Ergo, right? Like, SigmaFi, all the info

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
is right there. It's good. I kind of like
it. There's maybe some other things.

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Sometimes there's a lot of loans that show
up in SigmaFi. Being able to kind of

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
filter those might be cool, might be a
little bit better, or I'm excited about,

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
what is it, the proposals currently kind
of go one direction, so you might make a

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
loan request. I think they're going to
implement a lend request as well. Which is

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
interesting and helpful.

74
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah. OK. Yeah. I mean, so that's really
good feedback, because I mean, for

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
somebody who does want to do something in
the UI UX ErgoHack, right. So now if

76
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
you're going to design something right,
take some of what Tim was saying here and

77
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
integrate that sort of into your design,
because I mean, I think totally right,

78
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
especially with blockchain needs to be
simple, clean, concise. Doesn't need to

79
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
have like all this sort of stuff sort of
happening, I guess, in the background. And

80
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
then, but I mean, even I know from making
the Sigmanauts mining dashboard, at some

81
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
point, though, it's like, all right, this
is too much. But also, I cannot not have

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
this metric. And so there's got to be a
definitely a balance. But I'm glad I'm not

83
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
really a UI person, because that's a lot.

84
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah, I think something I keep hearing is
we need to get to the point where people

85
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
don't realize they're using the
blockchain. And I think that's probably a

86
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
great benchmark to hit. It's like, oh, no,
I'm just doing banking or I'm just using

87
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
this application that I need to do my
business. Totally. I'm not to feel like a

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
hacker.

89
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Right, and then and that even comes up
with like, or comes back to sort of like,

90
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
okay, so the user interface, what is that?
Should that even have like tons of crypto

91
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
feel? Right? Should have these crypto
tokens. And I know some of the Ethereum

92
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
sort of wallets and stuff. And they got
these crazy headers, things are bouncing.

93
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's like a, you're like at a casino kind
of a thing. And it's just like, hey, I'm

94
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
just trying to buy a token or something
like that. So yeah, definitely, again,

95
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
more you have really good feedback,
because I mean, you're totally right,

96
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
right? Like, if I was going to buy, if
somebody was going to legit buy a loan

97
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
that's backed by a blockchain, or not a
loan, or it could be a loan, a loan or

98
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
insurance, whatever, they want to make
sure again, that's trustworthy, it's

99
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
reputable. And then a lot of this other
crypto stuff meme coins and stuff has like

100
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
sort of a bad connotation to it. So
definitely got to be choosy with the

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
audience demographic words verbiage.

102
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, and the symbols like I always was
kind of taken aback by the food themed

103
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
everything. Like, I guess like, sushi swap
is kind of huge now. And nobody even

104
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
thinks about it as like a food thing, but
then we, now we have SundaeSwap and

105
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
PancakeSwap on, come on about that.

106
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah. All the toasty swap. I think that's
a food, right? Yeah, there's a lot. Yeah.

107
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah, totally. So it's like, and that's
even kind of going to some of the Ergo, I

108
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
guess, manifesto and stuff, like in the
sense of like, we're trying to be unique.

109
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We're trying to do our own thing, trying
to pave our own path, I suppose. Yeah.

110
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I guess something I wanted to bring up
and I guess a good point here. It's okay

111
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
if people just kind of have some fun too.
We have a new dApp called MewFinance. Have

112
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
you seen that?

113
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I bought some
cyberverse emotes on it.

114
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I bought some honey.

115
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, okay. Yeah.

116
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, awesome. I bought some honey. So I
don't know when that's coming in. But I

117
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
thought it was a pretty cool. A pretty
cool use. Like it was actually really

118
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
easy. I didn't feel didn't feel janky at
all. Yeah, excuse that stuff cooking for

119
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
sure. Yeah, I just I mean, I just like
bought food off the internet from somebody

120
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I don't know. So that's like a little bit
of a risk. But we'll see. We'll see. I'll

121
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
give it the smell test.

122
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, yeah, I'm excited to see where this
goes. I was talking to qx(), he wants to

123
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
do sort of like a hash rate system or not
hash rate system, a GPU system where we

124
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
can buy and sell them. And then we can
escrow them. And so we'll test them to

125
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
make sure they're good. And then we're in
all those details and stuff. So it's just

126
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
like, kind of started from like the
Sigmanauts swag where that qx() got for

127
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Vegas and then now it's like become this
and so I'm pretty excited to see like

128
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
maybe a year from now it becomes like this
just diverse on-chain real world asset

129
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
sort of ecosystem of just like buying and
selling stuff and then the mining pool we

130
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
might get linked up in there and so then
we could be like Oh, that cup of honey or

131
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the jar of honey, whatever. I want to mine
that. But it takes me two weeks to mine

132
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
however much you bought it for say, but
it'll be like a layaway sort of thing. So

133
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I mean, there's just so many different
applications to be able to use this sort

134
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
of thing, especially if shipping is
cheaper if you can get around like deport

135
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
or the taxes. But that's I don't know.

136
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah, dude, I think it's cool. And
something I remember, I think it was a TED

137
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
talk a while ago, a guy was just like
getting into the black market and just

138
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
like seeing what he could buy several
years ago. And one of the things that he

139
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
learned was that when it's like this open
market, reputation is literally

140
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
everything. And so the quality control
that people implement on these open

141
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
markets is really high, because all they
have is the reviews. And there's not this

142
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
barrier of entry that protects people. So
when I go to Smith's or whatever and I get

143
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
rotten grapefruits, it's a recent
experience. It doesn't matter if I go

144
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
bitch them out because nobody else is
selling grapefruit. But on an open market,

145
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
your reputation is everything and there is
competition because the barrier of entry

146
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
is very low. Right. So that to me just
really vibes with Ergo's whole philosophy

147
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and my own.

148
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
100% man. I mean, and now like, if you
make if you can have like a little hobby

149
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
that does something like you make key
chains, you can sell those key chains

150
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
straight out of your house. Now, start to
build a brand in some aspects, join the

151
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Sigmanauts do it for the Sigmanauts. Like,
yeah, man, there's gonna be a lot more

152
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
grassroots I feel like can maybe happen
now. Whereas early on it's like, the idea

153
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
is cool and it's like nebulous, but how
can I help? And then as we kind of move

154
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
forward, sort of, it's like a river and
it's like slowly growing and then, and

155
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
then that like is affecting the ability or
the applicability of the technology and

156
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
then usability too, I suppose. And so now
it can like affect more people. And so,

157
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
like you were saying earlier, where it's
like, what if someone can buy something on

158
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
MewFinance, buy it with dollars, switch to
ERG, do all that stuff in the back end,

159
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
not even know they're using the crypto,
and then just know that, like, oh,

160
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
MewFinance is this like peer to peer
system, it's got a reputation system, and

161
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm going to trust it, as opposed to this
other stuff. And then, yeah, that's just

162
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
so cool.

163
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah. So, another thing kind of taking
steps forward is Rosen. Do you see what's

164
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
going on there?

165
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yeah, right. They've crossed the bridge
to Ethereum. I haven't seen any bots pop

166
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
up on X or anything, so that's been good.
But yeah, exciting, right?

167
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yeah, yeah. Not a ton of LP over there
yet, but I saw like a screenshot of the

168
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
last, I don't know, 24 hours of volume and
like there's ERG is getting picked up on

169
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
that side and. It's just out of an
exciting first little day of activity over

170
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
there.

171
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah. And I think someone started an Ergo
raffle too. So you can afford the

172
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
liquidity and there's some stuff. So I'm
not sure if that's still going on, but

173
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
definitely check that out.

174
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yeah. You can, he'll give you your LP
tokens, right? Is that? Yeah, I think so.

175
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Something like that. So I really wonder
how that's all going to work out because

176
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I, I guess as soon as somebody is
interacting with both chains, they're just

177
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
going to realize it is like 1% the cost to
operate on Ergo. Like you could make a

178
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
position, take it away, do a different
one, take it away. But in ETH, you just

179
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
have to be really sure that what you're
doing is correct, because it costs you $17

180
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
to do something. And unless you're putting
in thousands of dollars, it's not even

181
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
worth it. Right.

182
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So you think the ecosystem will start to
see more Ethereum-related apps? Or I guess

183
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
it's made on Ergo, but for Ethereum? Do
you think those apps will start to be

184
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
created.

185
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I didn't get that. Maybe. Maybe. I think
either it'll be large positions of ERG on

186
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
the Ethereum side where the fees are worth
it. Or people from ETH are going to be

187
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
like, oh, this is maybe nice over here.
And so I don't know if they would just

188
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
bring their ETH over or would they pick up
ERG? Probably they would want to keep

189
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
their ETH. I don't know if they would
invest in a coin that they didn't fully

190
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
understand. It's just going to be
interesting to see.

191
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah, yeah, because I guess like, now
what's the incentive? The incentive is now

192
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
here for Ethereum developers, right? It's
like, you don't have to just be an Ergo

193
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
developer and just to support Ergo. Be an
Ethereum developer, come over here, use

194
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
our TX fees, right? And then do whatever
you need to do on our chain and then

195
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
facilitate it back over to Ethereum. Or
just keep it in Ergo because you can have

196
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
the RSV asset and so I they've been
pumping out a lot of those so and I'm not

197
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
really too keen on I guess the Ethereum
ecosystem but it would be an interesting

198
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
sort of idea to kind of even for like a
hackathon to sort of attach on sort of

199
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
dApps for other chains, but they're on
Ergo, I mean, similar to Rosen Bridge, I

200
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
guess, but to save in those fees. So and
then be able to swap back or whatever the

201
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
case.

202
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how
people use it. I I'm also interested in

203
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
like, how are the other tokens, like you
mentioned all the tokens from ADA, like

204
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
SundaeSwap tokens are now on Ethereum.
What are the consequences of that going to

205
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
be? Who knows?

206
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah, yeah, now those tokens are
susceptible to like all the bullshit in

207
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
terms of like, or not bullshit, but just
like, potentially getting locked on

208
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Ethereum, right? Or like stolen on
Ethereum or, whatever people, like we were

209
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
just talking about people developing
stuff. Well, all that is still, all that

210
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
stuff that has happened to Ethereum is
still maybe gonna be applied and now maybe

211
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
new attack vectors for specific tokens are
now open, right? Because they're on, I

212
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
mean, arbitrage, right? That's a new thing
because now we have all this, and it's

213
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
almost like an oracle in and of its own
sense, right? Because the oracle rate

214
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
isn't just catching up fast enough because
people aren't exchanging, buying and

215
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
selling on these individual sort of island
of tokens and stuff. So it's going to be

216
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
interesting to watch the landscape kind of
is it a weevil wobble tilting towards one

217
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
maybe crypto, hopefully Ergo, right? Or is
it gonna be balanced or is it, how's it

218
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
gonna look, right?

219
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yeah. How interesting. I'm excited for
the rest of the crypto sphere to get

220
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
connected. They're talking about Binance
chain. Yeah. I don't know much about Sui,

221
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
but I saw that come up. I'm really
interested to see Monero get connected.

222
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
They're waiting on a major update that's
happening there. And then that might be a

223
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
priority. Yeah, that would be sweet.

224
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What do you like in terms of privacy that
Monero, I think we talked about it a

225
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
little bit before, but what do you like
about Monero specifically that maybe Ergo

226
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
doesn't have?

227
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I think that it's necessary to have an
option that is, so privacy is optional on

228
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Ergo. And I think that's probably the most
widely usable way, I guess. How do I say?

229
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
If you're building something for everyone,
privacy should be optional, not mandatory,

230
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,000
but I think everyone should have a choice
to use Monero because it's like 100%

231
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,000
private by design, like in the core
protocol. And I don't want to say 100%

232
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
private because nothing's 100% private,
but that level of privacy is just there,

233
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and it's simple for people. Whereas for
us, it's like, oh, we have to download the

234
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
front end for the mixer and do these
steps. There's a little bit of a barrier.

235
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And people might not prefer that. And I
think if you could just, oh, I'll just

236
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
bridge to Monero and then make a
transaction and then bridge back to a new

237
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
wallet. mixed.

238
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Okay, I see what you're saying. So you're
suggesting maybe taking your funds,

239
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
bridging them to Monero, then do the whole
privacy and then maybe bridge back again

240
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
from Rosen Bridge, but then to a new Ergo
wallet and then go from there, right?

241
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Maybe. Yeah, yeah, that's something that
could happen. And it could also happen the

242
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
other way where Monero is like, oh, I have
all this Monero and I want to borrow

243
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
against my Monero. and accessed proper
DeFi, that's not quite possible there on

244
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Monero.

245
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yeah, no, that's a great point. And then
like to that point, right, if you think

246
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
about the total crypto market cap, right,
from a loan perspective, it's like we've

247
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
got all this money to loan out. Because
people are probably just sitting on their

248
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
bags and stuff. And so using DeFi and Ergo
as that sort of ability, like you're

249
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
saying, DuckPools is awesome. I love
DuckPools, participated in the IDEO

250
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
yesterday. But yeah, having that
capability and, again, going back to

251
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
trustworthiness, it's like, okay, yeah,
I'll give out some of my ERGs to loan out

252
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
or whatever the case, SigmaUSD when that
was popping. We were looking at a thing

253
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
this last weekend, man, it was like 40% or
20%. That's crazy. It's dropped a lot.

254
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yeah. Oh, man, it was really high for a
while. It was like, 60s, like 70% like it

255
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:52,000
was it was high. It was 120% at one point.
Yeah, dude.

256
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's 2.5 right now.

257
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Interesting how interesting you would
think people would be like going long now.

258
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's kind
of weird for sure. Maybe they all got

259
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
wiped out. Yeah, right. Nobody else has
any funds. That's why it's just stayed

260
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
around like 65 cents, 70 cents. Yeah.
Yeah. I was just waiting for Bitcoin to

261
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
carry the way it carry us through. Right.
The wave.

262
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Yeah. All right. So hey, I had a couple
other things for us to talk about. So

263
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
something that I came across when I first
joined Ergo was called Metal Saturdays.

264
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And I just thought this is so cool. Have
you seen Metal Saturdays?

265
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
No, I haven't.

266
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I saw kushti say, hey, can I get proof of
metal? And so everybody started just

267
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
sharing their YouTube links for their
favorite metal songs or just whatever they

268
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
were jamming that day. And it's kind of
every Saturday. I say Saturday, but it's

269
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
like a UTC type of thing. So like, I don't
know if it's Friday or Saturday. And every

270
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
week I probably, you probably see like 20
or so links to, I don't know, just

271
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
somebody's Lamb of God or, whatever they
got going on.

272
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What channel is that happening in?

273
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Just the main one, just the main one.
It's every now and then somebody will

274
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
start it off. There's a guy named MX, you
know MX. No, he's one of the OGs. He's, I

275
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
think he's kind of the anchor and kushti
as well. And then we'll see, cafe and all

276
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the people who've been here for a long
time and like throwing their stuff in. I

277
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
just thought it was cool. Like when I
first started in crypto. everyone was

278
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
serious. Not serious, but it's about this
thing. And then I just got to see actual

279
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
culture emerge from this thing. And it's
like, oh, these are humans. These are

280
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
humans. And they like to rock.

281
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Do you like something else that I like?
Oh, that's awesome. Yeah.

282
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Totally. Yeah.

283
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I'm not a big fan of metal, I would say.
But I will listen to it. I'm a big fan of

284
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
reggae. Oh, yeah. like 311. I'm like
blanking at all the bands right now.

285
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Revolution, Irish.

286
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Cool, man. Yeah, yeah. I would say I'm
not like a metal fan either. Like, there's

287
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
a time and a place.

288
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we can start a
reggae Sundays. Yeah, any case, that'd be

289
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
funny.

290
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So that kind of inspired me to start
something a while ago. I don't know how

291
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
long it's been. But so I started a channel
called the Ergo Fight Club. And it's not

292
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
terribly popular. But so every every
Saturday or like every other Saturday, any

293
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Saturday that there's a fight, there's a
group of maybe there's probably like eight

294
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
of us that we just hop on the chat anytime
there's a UFC event or like maybe a

295
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
headline boxing match or something. We got
the tipper bot in there. So we're, betting

296
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
one ERG here and there on who it is. And I
think this next big event, I think in

297
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
November, we're going to do like a parlay,
like, you're going to pick, we're going to

298
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
pick the whole card. the outcome and
whoever has the most correct guesses is

299
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
gonna take the pot.

300
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
There you go. That sounds like fun. Well,
yeah. Where can people find out about

301
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
that? Cause I know they have like that big
list of like all the groups, but I don't

302
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
think I've, I don't think I'm in there.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You should get that out

303
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and talk to Glasgow or something.

304
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I will. I will. Yeah. Every now and then
I'll put it out on, on Twitter just to

305
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
like, see if anyone wants to join, or in
the main one. But every time we do it on

306
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Twitter, you would pick up like seven bots
and then have to just remove it.

307
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yeah, that's how it goes, I guess. Yeah,
I put it in the main because Ergo platform

308
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
one.

309
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Yeah. But yeah, so that was me just
trying to contribute after seeing like,

310
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Metal Saturdays, like people just doing
the thing that they like. And then turns

311
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
out there's a bunch of people that enjoy
the fights too. So yeah, so crazy thing

312
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
happened actually. So got to talking with
one of the guys there. And I won't say who

313
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
it is just for privacy. Turns out that me
and him trained at the same gym in like

314
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
2011. Like we were definitely training at
the same gym at the same time in

315
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Albuquerque, New Mexico.

316
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Oh, wow.

317
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And like, that's as far as it went. We
didn't see each other. We don't live in

318
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
the same state. And it was just like, oh,
I was there. I trained there for three

319
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
years. I was like, oh, yeah, me too.

320
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And like, that's as far as it went, you
know, we didn't like, did you guys

321
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
recognize each other after like, you saw
each other again, or?

322
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
That's so funny. Yeah, it's funny how
that all works. That's hilarious. Small

323
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
world. Yeah, absolutely. You're like, oh,
I can't remember if I kicked your butt or

324
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
not, but I definitely did. No. That's
awesome. No, that's super sick. Have you

325
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
talked to CannonQ about some of this?
Because he's developing a dApp called The

326
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Field. And then you'll be able to do the
parlay stuff on chain.

327
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
and bedding and stuff. I'm super excited.
So I really, I was really disappointed

328
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
when Night Owl casino didn't pan out. And
I saw Jay around actually recently, but I

329
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
didn't bring anything up, but I was super
disappointed because I wanted the sports

330
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
betting. Like that's a killer dApp. and
I'm really glad that CannonQ picked it up

331
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
and just looking forward to it. Tipper
bot's cool. Sorry, Lou. But this will be

332
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
better.

333
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Yeah, for sure. So how do you guys do the
tipper bot? You just say, hey, I'll take

334
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
this bet. Someone's like, all right,
agreed. And then whoever wins or loses,

335
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
wins or loses. Then you're like, all
right, tip it out, one ERG or whatever.

336
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We just keep it
small. That way it's never like, you know.

337
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. No,
that's a lot of things. That's a lot of

338
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
fun. I mean, especially to like if you
had, like with CannonQ's app, like get

339
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
something integrated to where you can just
put, connect to your credit card,

340
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
translate some ERGs, and then again, going
back to you're not even know this user's

341
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
crypto.

342
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yeah, that'll be cool. So I was thinking,
it's on the topic of culture and

343
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
principles. Some of the apps that I've
seen, I just thought it was so cool when I

344
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
first was exploring Ergo. It was like the
Ergo Lend or EXLE. And they've kind of set

345
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,000
up this, I guess, relationship. They've
built a relationship with people in Kenya,

346
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,000
just kind of regularly take out some 0%
loans and they pay it back and then they

347
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
take another one and they pay. I mean, to
me that just really underscores the power

348
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
of what this is capable of doing. And I'm
excited to see it grow. I don't know

349
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,000
anyone in Kenya, but one of the guys
that's around for a long time, his name is

350
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Riro. Do you know Riro?

351
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I've heard the name.

352
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah, he's he's in Mumbai. And just like,
nice guy in Mumbai just sends pictures of

353
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
like, what he's making for dinner or
whatever. And it's cool. It's like, this

354
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,000
is benefit him or people like him. Totally
see an actual change.

355
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Yeah, yeah, for sure. Finance and kind of
benefiting us and more of a like you're

356
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
saying cultural ecosystems kind of raise
everybody up by the bootstraps rather than

357
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
just like a select few.

358
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Yeah, yeah. And then that that kind of
gives gets into like the local exchange

359
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
trading system. Have you come across that
yet?

360
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Okay, no, I haven't heard of that one
then.

361
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So LETS is like a circular economy. So it
will kind of be a dApp. And it's kind of

362
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
like ChainCash maybe. I think ChainCash is
maybe more of an open ecosystem where you

363
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
can have something as collateral and then
you can lend your token or send your token

364
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
backed by that. And then you can always
somebody can always redeem the token for

365
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
the collateral. And ChainCash also has
this aspect where like the next person can

366
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
have collateral. And so the tokens are
actually backed by everyone's collateral

367
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
eventually. Okay. And that I think has
like, bigger implications like a country

368
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
or a state might like, I have all this oil
and I want to issue a coin against it. So

369
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
people can interact. But LETS is more like
small. So let's say if you had like, I

370
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
don't know, just like a little village or
something and you needed a system for

371
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
accounting, that's it, right? It's like,
here's the tokens. They could have it be

372
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
backed by something. And it's just like,
for them to monitor. And it's actually an

373
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,000
old idea, local exchange trading system,
it's been done a bunch of times. But now

374
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
it's like, with this technology, and, you
bring up all the other stuff, NIPoPoWs,

375
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and whatever. It's like, yeah, anyone can
do this. Like you just need like a tiny

376
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,000
bit of internet and you're good to go.

377
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah, that's pretty powerful. I think I
did see LETS on like, one of the EIPs.

378
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
They were talking about like, some dApps
and like suitable ways to like mock them

379
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
up. But yeah, I mean, again, bringing real
world, applications is going to be huge

380
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
and where blockchains really shows its
strength are these applications to where

381
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
you can loan out somebody on a good faith
loan. Yeah here Don't worry about any of

382
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
the interest but know that you're going to
get paid back There is collateral

383
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
collected within the blockchain. So if
they don't pay you back, that sucks, but

384
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
there are things kind of in place to kind
of facilitate that And be able to kind of

385
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
you know, I guess in a sense, siphon some
of our wealth off into these other places.

386
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And then again, just start to bolster up
these other economies. That'd be cool to

387
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
see. Yeah, man. Probably be some years
before it's all like out the wild, but

388
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
yeah, probably more dApps, easier to use,
like you were saying, from a real world,

389
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm curious how they would actually use it
though in Africa. Right. And then like

390
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
connected to all on chain, and then like
how many computers did they have access

391
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
to? And then like, so what sort of dApp
would be even optimal to facilitate that?

392
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And then, of course, replicating it and
stuff. Yeah, I think probably are, yeah,

393
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
indeed, some time away just because I
think we're still igleys and Ergo's kind

394
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
of facilitating the, I think that we have
dApps right but I think we're on the verge

395
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
of just like explosive dApps and sense of
like, we have a lot of them, or they have

396
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
a lot of punch not the not to say that the
ones don't now but. I think we're

397
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
attracting more people to the ecosystem,
especially with the Ergo hacks and things

398
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
like that. And so hopefully we'll start to
see more and more of these types of

399
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
applications. I know with the good things
that qx(), wants to do more lending and do

400
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
things like that. So that'll be really
neat. I wonder what he's doing with that.

401
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
We'll have to ask him next time he's on.
Yeah.

402
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Yeah. So anyways, that's my list of
topics for today. You have anything else

403
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
you want to chat about?

404
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I don't know. That's all good on my end.
I need to get back to it. The boxes are

405
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
calling. Not the UTXO boxes.

406
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Best of luck with that, man. Drive safe
and don't let your cat cause an accident.

407
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Absolutely. All right. Take care. See you
everybody.
