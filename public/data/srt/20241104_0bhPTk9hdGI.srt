1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Mark, what's up, man?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hey, Tim.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Good, man.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Long time.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
How's it going?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Dude, I'm doing very good.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I just moved and got my life in order.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But happy to sit down for a minute.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This will be episode two.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We had a little hiccup with our episodes.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And so this is episode two.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And today, we kind of wanted to talk
about some current events.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
First thing was just like a big thing.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I think it's super cool.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Like just the emission reduction just
happened.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Do you want to kind of talk about that?

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Like where are we at and where are we
going?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah, absolutely.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So I think we're at 21 now as a block
reward.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And so I think I counted this morning, we
have six more steps from a decrease of

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
three to get to three.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So sometime in 2026.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So I think the miners are definitely
starting to feel it.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I mean, especially from earlier this
year, we were at like 30, really like 33

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
or something like that.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And then now we're... What does that make
sense?

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Anyways, we're at something like that.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And then now here we are at 21.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Next one's about to be 18.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So less and less are being mined, and the
price is still sort of consistently the

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
same.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So it's an interesting sort of trade off
from a mining perspective right now to

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
where we're getting even less ERG.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Essentially the same electricity costs
around the same sort of cost to sell it.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So hopefully start to see some pressure
one way or the other, hopefully up, to

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
kind of alleviate some of the mining
struggles at the moment, but kind of

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
exciting, nonetheless, another sort of
halving but not so.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I mean, honestly, it's more than a
halving since when I started, I think when

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I got in at 21, it was 72, right?

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's a lot of ERG right now.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And it was a lot of ERG, and we were at
$10 or something.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, absolutely.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
When I think about that I just learned so
much about like trading and stuff like,

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
oh, I should definitely have taken
profits. I knew it was gonna happen.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And it was actually more aggressive.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The emission was more aggressive.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Before we changed it.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Do you want to talk about the emission,
the contract, the new change that

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
happened?

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm not too familiar, I guess.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So yeah, why don't you go ahead and take
it away?

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Sure.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So there was an initial emission curve
that had all of the ERG being emitted, I

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
think in like eight years.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So like before 2030, like all the ERG
would have been emitted.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And so it was like really aggressive.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And then they voted on this via mining,
which is sick.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So they had people indicate their
preference with a setting in their config

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
file.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And they got 90% consensus, which is
sick.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And so now, that's all.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, 90%.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm going to take an aside.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm going to skip the story.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'll come back.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Anyway, so now some of the ERG gets put
into a re-emission contract.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So that initial emission is split.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So some of it goes to the miners, some of
it goes to a contract, and that contract

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
is then delayed.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And so that is how we've created a longer
tail to 2045 or something.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah, so after we get down to three ERG,
it's all going to be coming from the re

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
emission contract.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay, right.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Not very much ERG.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And it's just a lot of pressure.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And kind of like you said, one way or the
other, it's going to go someplace.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah, absolutely.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And it's, I kind of remember now, now
that you're saying that where it's like,

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
it was kind of a big deal in the ecosystem
at the time to where I think Coastal

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Crypto made like a video to where it's
like, the devs are like stealing your ERG,

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
basically, it's like, oh, they're changing
something in the blockchain.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And in reality, you could shape it how
you want, but in reality, it's like, it's

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
for the longevity of the chain.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And I'm looking at it right now, it looks
like actually 2044, this month on the

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
27th, it looks like it'll go to zero right
after that.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So I mean, yeah, that's quite a long time
to be mining ERG from then.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And then we have storage rent as well.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Because we're starting to hit it now
within our mining pool within the last

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
four years, but there just needs to be
these incentives for miners to stay on the

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
network.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And even Bitcoin has that sort of kind of
built into their protocol too.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But like you were saying, it's, I think
it's even way further out, right?

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Isn't it like 2144?

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Right.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So that's an extremely long time that
they're going to be slowly, slowly mining.

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So it will be interesting as well.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Like we're sort of approaching these
limits.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So like very early on, a lot of tokens
will be distributed on our network,

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Bitcoin's network.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And it will be interesting as I guess
we're approaching some sort of like a

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
limit with respect to that.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And we'll see how that actually gets to
play out.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's like these sorts of parameters that
we get the change now.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We'll actually get to see those end
results and how well Ergo's protocol

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
worked out compared to Bitcoin and vice
versa.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So that'll be kind of interesting.

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And like in 20 years, man.

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
100%.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And I'm also just really excited to see
how adjustable fees and the storage rent

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and also things like fair initial mining
offerings can support mining in that

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
really low emission environment.

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Like once we get to three, I feel like
it's gonna make other things quite

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
valuable.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's like, you're gonna need to be paying
attention to the storage rent, to like

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
what can be scavenged and collected by
your mining pool.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And if your mining pool's not doing that,
it's probably not gonna be profitable.

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So it's going to really incentivize
innovation and people finding new ways to

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:28,000
identify things faster or offer rewards to
the miners for starting their projects.

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, I mean, that's a great point.

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Because people are actually doing that
now where they're able to get these, the

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
UTXOs with storage rent, but without hash
power for some reason.

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't really know the nuances of it,
but somebody is able to essentially run a

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
script and gather those UTXOs, I think
without hash at least.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And qx() would be the better person, I
guess, to explain that to myself.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And so I think, yeah, just continuing to
push innovation with this sort of thing is

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
interesting.

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But then you brought up fair initial
mining offering.

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So would that be more of like a just a
token on like a network to where it's

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
like, would that be a side chain?

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Would that be sort of like a layer two?

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What would that sort of be, I suppose?

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
OK, so I think it could be either.

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I guess when I was talking about it, I
was imagining, let's say you wanted to

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
come up with a new protocol, like a
lending protocol or whatever, and you

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
wanted to distribute your governance
tokens or something.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You could offer them as mining rewards to
be collected.

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So you could just add, oh, I'm going to
input 10 tokens every block to be mined.

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And I'm not sure if that's done through
some sort of script, maybe like mimicking

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
the re emission contract, or if you would
just like set the block height to whatever

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
you want it to be.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So it could be collected like garbage.

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Probably either way.

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Totally.

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But yeah, and then it's just like,
whoever gets it gets it.

149
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And they're not like paying you, not a
security. Howey test.

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah, absolutely.

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And you brought up side chains and layer
twos.

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So I think also it's like those are
getting mined also, right?

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And so if you're running your miner and
there's a side chain going on that's the

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
same algo as Autolykos, it's like you're
kind of getting both of those rewards at

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the same time, I think.

156
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay, interesting.

157
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Because I think it's an interesting
concept and there's a lot of, I suppose it

158
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
depends on like the security aspects and
what you're trying to do with it.

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Because I think from like a token
perspective, it would be interesting

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
because I feel like that would be like the
lowest hanging fruit.

161
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And if you had like all you would need to
do is essentially if your mining pool

162
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
supported it, you could just say, hey,
look at my participation when we find a

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
block on Ergo.

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, you found that block on Ergo.

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Here's the reward you get from like Mark
and Tim smart contracts, and then you get

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
10 tokens for that block reward and then
that distributes.

167
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But then I guess you'd have to build in
some like why I guess why would you want

168
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
to do that, aside from like the fair
initial mining offering standpoint.

169
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Would it make sense for just one pool to
support it or do all pools need to support

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
it?

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So it's kind of an interesting, how fair
do we want it to be?

172
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Because fairness is in some sense
subjective.

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And so it's like a spectrum even, I
guess.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So I think when you get into like, when
you get into a side chain, like you might

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
have an application specific side chain,
right?

176
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So it's like a chain running, kind of
leveraging Ergo security, but it has a

177
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
specific purpose.

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Like maybe there's like one dApp that
just has its own little chain.

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And then maybe it's like, they kind of to
your point, like they don't want everyone

180
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
to get those tokens.

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
They might want their tokens to be
distributed under certain conditions.

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So I think it just allows a lot of things
to be possible, which is super cool.

183
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

184
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It'd be fun to work on something like
that.

185
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I saw I think Armeanio posted that as
sort of like an idea for the next coming

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
ErgoHack for somebody to work on.

187
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So hopefully somebody picks that up.

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That'd be cool to see.

189
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, for sure.

190
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So dude, did you see NiceHash is starting
to require KYC?

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, yeah, that makes me somewhat
nervous as like the mining pool operator

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
for, and even qx() right for the
Sigmanauts mining pool.

193
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We've talked a little bit about it and
what we're going to do and stuff.

194
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But yeah, I mean, it's cool for a lot of
our tools, right?

195
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The whole point is to be permissionless.

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't need anybody's permission to join
the network.

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So I think it's like, in some sense,
bullshit, right?

198
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
If I can say that here, but I don't know,
what are your thoughts?

199
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh man.

200
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Like, so every time something like that
happens, I just, it reinforces that I've

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
kind of made the right choice to associate
myself with Ergo.

202
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Just my values align and it's like, no,
like just we're trying to enable freedom

203
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and have a open permissionless transparent
network for anyone to participate in.

204
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And like, oh, I have to register with you
and give you my personal information.

205
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Like, dude, I honestly I hate doing that
because I've gotten four notices in the

206
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
past, I'll say 18 months that some
organization has been hacked and lost my

207
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
data.

208
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And like, right, like what, like, stop,
stop doing that.

209
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Stop asking.

210
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah, and then you have to give it to
them for free.

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
They're not safeguarding it.

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
There's no protocol in place to where
it's like, hey, I'm going to give you this

213
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
information, and I don't necessarily have
to trust your own security and privacy.

214
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Let's let the blockchain do it for us.

215
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But here we have all these people in the
way with their sort of, I guess, systems

216
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
that are hackable in some sense.

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And then here we are where it's like,
yeah, then all your data is distributed.

218
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
which is crazy because like even from
like a business sense, you can come up

219
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
with LLCs and trusts that obfuscate your
own name away.

220
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So like, so in theory, like that could be
a legitimate way for somebody to maybe

221
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
avoid like you are tied to like this
mining rig, like come up with an LLC or

222
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
trust, I suppose.

223
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But so then at least it's tied in some
like entity, I guess, and things like

224
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
that.

225
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But but yeah, dude, so something really
interesting about LLCs in the United

226
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
States.

227
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
They just made a law that you have to now
associate your LLC with your legal name.

228
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So there's KYC on LLCs now, so that's
going away.

229
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, really?

230
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Interesting.

231
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah.

232
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I think at the start of 25.

233
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:39,000
OK. Well, I better get mine ready to go
then.

234
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yeah.

235
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So I mean, then it comes back to like the
first principles of Ergo of just like,

236
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
again, why, like being permissionless
privacy is important.

237
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Like, I'm getting ready to move to, I'm
going to rent out my house.

238
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Like I don't really want my renters
knowing what I own, knowing what I have.

239
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I want them to know my name.

240
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So like privacy is like extremely
important especially when you're doing

241
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
just like day-to-day sort of like deals
and then then there becomes like all these

242
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
attack vectors as you could say once you
actually know somebody's like who they are

243
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and where they live you know there have
been like home invasions because certain

244
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
people have found out where they live they
know

245
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
their YouTube personality like on, or
something like that, right?

246
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And then they try to steal their crypto
keys or, it's shit like that.

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's crazy.

248
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So I mean, to be tied to that.

249
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's just like insane.

250
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And the whole thing around KYC and
blockchain is it's kind of funny to me,

251
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
because it's like, I think through zero
knowledge proofs, like you could you could

252
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
absolutely prove that it's not you without
giving away your identity.

253
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's the magic of ZK.

254
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You can prove that it's not you.

255
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So then what?

256
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Why do I have to give you all my info?

257
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Totally.

258
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Well, I think it's just maybe like
regulation trying to catch up with crypto

259
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
and they're trying to do their best.

260
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
They're like, oh, I don't really
understand this.

261
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And they don't, I guess, maybe understand
like why certain things are so important.

262
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But I think on the other hand, because
it's kind of like, if you think about it,

263
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
like, it's sort of like this predator prey
sort of like kind of mindset and model,

264
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
you can model it as to where Bitcoin to
say this prey in this example, starts to

265
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
come up, there's a lot of like Bitcoin
people, we need to get regulation starts

266
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
to come down some more predators.

267
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So there's like a balance between this
sort of ecosystem model, I guess you could

268
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
like sort of envision.

269
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And then eventually, I guess wondered
depending on the I guess the ecosystem

270
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
right you know what the predator or the
prey becomes extinct right and so

271
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
hopefully I guess in this case neither
because they really the game is to

272
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
continue to play the game and so hopefully
you know we create more tools to kind of

273
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
get around certain things that we
essentially want to get around from a

274
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
legal perspective and the legal systems
like oh I see.

275
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
this is really important for that reason.

276
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Okay, let's adjust this over here and
kind of vice versa.

277
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
We need to, I think, have the talks, but
the way they're doing it is not the right

278
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
way to kind of go about it, I would say,
it's very, very much a lot of control.

279
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah, yeah, totally, man.

280
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And it and it's like, just reinforcing
how much they don't get it.

281
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah.

282
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Right, right.

283
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Like, bless his heart, Trump is starting
his what's it called, like, freedom,

284
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
finance or something.

285
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And it's like, oh my gosh, right.

286
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah, one KYC, like, right.

287
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yeah.

288
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But lucky for us, the ethos around Ergo
is leading to like some really cool

289
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
solutions, Lithos coming online,

290
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
For those of you who haven't heard of
that, Lithos is like a distributed

291
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
permissionless mining pool, kind of run on
the blockchain.

292
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So you don't, it's not like a centralized
thing, like NiceHash where like somebody's

293
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
responsible for all your stuff.

294
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's actually run on the blockchain.

295
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And so that's coming online as 6.0 gets
finished, Node 6.0.

296
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't really know enough about it to
talk about it.

297
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
But I think that's a sign for us to get a
guest on here who has something to

298
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
contribute there.

299
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I think, I bet kushti would come and tell
us about 6.0.

300
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah, absolutely.

301
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I mean, that'd be a lot of fun.

302
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I mean, just to, cause I think with 6.0
comes a lot of things just from, so yeah,

303
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
we have Lithos, I think Sigma protocols.

304
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So I think that's side chains, so really
sort of like, it's a door and potentially

305
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
a pretty big door from like ecosystem
perspective.

306
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So then once we have this, there's a lot
of little, not little, I suppose, but

307
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
other things we can sort of tie and attach
to and then more applications, more

308
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
applications mean more real world
applications.

309
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And that's gonna be really cool to see.

310
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah, man, I think side chains are one of
the things that I got most excited about

311
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
when I started learning about Ergo.

312
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I remember, what was it called?

313
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Ergo.meta, right?

314
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And it's like a sidechain cookbook is
what I remember kushti characterizing it.

315
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So it's like, it's just like a dev kit,
right?

316
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But for these like, here's how you make
your sidechain.

317
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And my imagination kind of goes wild.

318
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Like we talked about application specific
side chains, but I also like to think

319
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
about building like Monero on top of Ergo.

320
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
That way it's like kind of capturing the
more, I don't want to say extreme, but

321
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
like the more maximal viewpoint of like, I
really get why people like Monero.

322
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's, I think that is maybe the most
valid maximalism in my view, it's like I

323
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
see Bitcoin maximalism as like being
conservative and not wanting to like risk

324
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
all your money on some like brand new
shitcoin.

325
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I get it.

326
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But I also think somebody who's like, No,
we need to have an unstoppable tool.

327
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's Monero.

328
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That makes sense to me.

329
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And it just needs some legs.

330
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Like we need to have DeFi, you need to
have lending and borrowing and stablecoins

331
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and all this stuff and if we can we can
put that on Ergo on it as a sidechain or

332
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
somehow bridging it I don't know I'm not
the guy to give you the technical details

333
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
but if we can give Monero some legs like
now we're cooking with gas

334
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah, yeah, that would be huge.

335
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And isn't Monero mined with CPUs?

336
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I think, right?

337
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah, so I mean, that's just so
accessible, like everybody for the most

338
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
part has a CPU in their mining Ergo, so
you could probably dual mine in some

339
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
aspects.

340
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And it would be cool opportunity for the
Sigmanauts mining pool to kind of stand up

341
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
other pools on these side chains to kind
of support that and

342
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah, I mean, especially just with this
whole KYC thing having that privacy aspect

343
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
that privacy buffer just to be able to
say, hey, no, I hear what you're saying

344
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
government, but I'm still going to do
this, and protect yourself, right?

345
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Because like, ultimately, in some places,
it is against the law.

346
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm not trying to get arrested.

347
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I have a little one at home.

348
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So it's like, let's make sure and so
having those tools building for war so to

349
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
speak is gonna be very important that you
have the proper tools right so if you're

350
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
going against war against somebody who has
bullets and all you have is a shield that

351
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
can't stop bullets or something like that
that's not really gonna do too well versus

352
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
having like so we need the proper
equipment to be able to say hey no I hear

353
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
what you're saying but we're still gonna
do this and it's like you're saying

354
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
unstoppable so yeah it's a powerful idea

355
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Yeah.

356
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So I think this means we need to get
somebody smarter than the two of us to

357
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
teach us about side chains, about 6.0, all
that.

358
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
All right.

359
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So I'm going to move us forward.

360
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
We wanted to talk a little bit about
something that happened a few years ago,

361
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
just like a little story about something
that Ergo went through and was hardened

362
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
by.

363
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm going to share my screen, and
hopefully this doesn't mess up Andy's

364
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
beautiful work.

365
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
All right.

366
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
There we go.

367
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Nice.

368
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The bear whale.

369
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah.

370
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So these are so that bear whale.

371
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
All right.

372
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
First of all, it's an awesome drawing.

373
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Absolutely.

374
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Bear whale, the bear whale saga.

375
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:09,000
This was in 2021, where a large holder
was draining the SigmaUSD account or the

376
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:17,000
bank, specifically attacking the RSV
holders.

377
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And so just to kind of give an overview,
some prior knowledge, SigmaUSD is our kind

378
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
of flagship stablecoin.

379
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And it works by having two tokens.

380
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So the SigmaUSD here and SigRSV.

381
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So USD is obviously pegged to a dollar.

382
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And that peg is maintained by allowing
volatility in the RSV, which is like the

383
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
reserve token.

384
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Okay, so there's the bank that holds all
the ERG, and then the value of these two

385
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
tokens is, well, one of them is held
stable, and then the other fluctuates

386
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
based on the value of the ERG that's held
in the bank.

387
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
All right, so these are kind of the rules
that it operates under.

388
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So you can always redeem your SigmaUSD,
but you can't you can't mint the USD

389
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
unless there is 400% of the value in the
reserve.

390
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So if there's not enough reserves, then
you can't mint the USD.

391
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And if there's not enough reserves, you
also can't redeem your RSV.

392
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So you can kind of get locked in.

393
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And so these are the rules.

394
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
The bear whale was able to manipulate the
rules in this first version in SigmaUSD

395
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
version one.

396
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Okay.

397
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
What he was doing was like super clever.

398
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Sometimes when I'm in blockchain, I'm
just like, man, I'm just not that smart

399
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
compared to all these guys.

400
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So he was taking advantage of the Oracle
speed, right?

401
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So he would jump into a position of
SigmaUSD and then the Oracle is reading

402
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
the markets in, I don't know, we'll say
TradeOgre or whatever.

403
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And he had enough ERG to sell all the ERG
and that crash the price the Oracle would

404
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,000
read that price and then so his SigmaUSD
position would actually be able to be

405
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,000
redeemed for more ERG than he bought it
for, right?

406
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So then he would, so he would buy
SigmaUSD, crash the price, the Oracle

407
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
would see that crash, and then that would
be reflected here.

408
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So let's say he paid 100 bucks or 100 ERG
for 100 SigmaUSD.

409
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Then the value of the ERG goes down to,
let's say it's now his SigmaUSD is worth

410
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
120 ERG.

411
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
He switched back in and then bought his
position back to raise the price.

412
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And so he was able to like slowly collect
ERG, not slowly, but over time he

413
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
collected a bunch of ERG just by gaming
this little system.

414
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And so there's a cool article in, in the
ergoplatform.org.

415
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
If anyone wants to read about it, you can
see how the community was like learning

416
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
about it, tracking his wallets.

417
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
People started writing scripts to kind of
try to get around this and not let it

418
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
happen.

419
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And eventually what the team had to do
was slow down the rate of change that the

420
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Oracle could report.

421
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So I think it's now, they limited the
update to 0.5% every 30 minutes, up or

422
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
down.

423
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And so now if the bear whale tried to do
it again, he would actually have to hold

424
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
the price down for longer and for more
than 30 minutes if he wanted a 0.5%

425
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
change.

426
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And so it might not be really worth the
risk.

427
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And actually when it happened, I think he
lost, this article says he lost 170,000

428
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
ERG trying to keep doing it after they
patched the protocol.

429
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Which I just thought was like a really
cool story about, finding an attacker who

430
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
had, it's just like a, not like a clever,
good on him, but ended up prevailing in

431
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
the end.

432
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
How long was the whole saga?

433
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Like from, like, when I guess from the
initial attack to when they patched it.

434
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Cause I would imagine once they kind of
figured out like, Oh, wow, I see what's

435
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
happening.

436
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
We need to kind of act now, I'm curious
about that.

437
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm not sure.

438
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm not sure how long it was.

439
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It says something about between $2 and
$4.

440
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So probably not that long.

441
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I bet it was like six months that the
version one was going.

442
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And then they updated it to version two.

443
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I mean, thankfully that happened now,
honestly, versus like, imagine if we had

444
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
like multiple bear whales attacking at the
same time, just essentially attacking the

445
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
network in that aspect.

446
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And especially when it was like so, so
high in terms of price.

447
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And even some people now say the price is
being manipulated in some sense.

448
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And maybe, maybe it is.

449
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
With all these guys with all these, like
a hundred thousand or he lost like, so he

450
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
must've been using a lot more than a
hundred thousand.

451
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
That's a lot.

452
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I mean, I don't know how I feel about
like, okay.

453
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So I think the term manipulation is a
little bit funny because to me, if it's

454
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
just like a market, and people are selling
and buying and like, you could do whatever

455
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
you want.

456
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Absolutely.

457
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I think the only time it becomes really
unethical is like, if the founders are

458
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
doing something, like if the Ergo
Foundation treasury is being used to like,

459
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
do the bear whale thing, like that, that's
messed up.

460
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But if it's just like some rich guy, like
it's what it is.

461
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah.

462
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So take as much control as you want,
right.

463
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So I mean, the rules are there.

464
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
If you can do it, then send it.

465
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I totally agree.

466
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
But yeah, something's happening, I guess.

467
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
But in any case, it's interesting,
though.

468
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It's like, how does somebody even figure
out that you can even do the thing that

469
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
the bear whale did?

470
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Like that must've taken some serious, or
maybe not, I don't know.

471
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I mean, I haven't really played too much
around with it, the idea, but sounds

472
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
pretty complicated and complex to be able
to kind of sort through.

473
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And then obviously they had some pretty
confidence in doing it, especially since,

474
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
even after it was patched, they kept
sending it and sending it and trying it

475
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
and trying it.

476
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So then realize, oh wow, okay, maybe they
fixed it or something like that, right?

477
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah.

478
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And even more to my point about like,
it's like, whatever, it's just like how

479
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
the world works.

480
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
This ended up hardening the, not just the
SigmaUSD protocol with the changes, now

481
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
it's stronger, but it led to like, oh,
like, we could come up with maybe simpler

482
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
designs or other more secure designs for
stable coins.

483
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And that's led us on to Dexy and Gluon,
which are super cool.

484
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'll just share the gluon design.

485
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
It has these two tokens that are kind of
like SigmaUSD and SigRSV.

486
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
This is the stable coin that's not really
stable.

487
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's just pegged to gold.

488
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And then this is the reserve token.

489
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
But you don't just buy one.

490
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You have to mint both, which is pretty
cool.

491
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And that allows for a lower reserve ratio
requirement.

492
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Since everyone's like simultaneously
minting both of these and then and then

493
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
they have to sell, if you actually just
wanted gold, well, then you have to sell

494
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
your guac over here.

495
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I keep calling it guac, G-A-U-C. You have
to keep selling this and then you get then

496
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
you get all gold or only gold and that
leads to the protocol earning fees.

497
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:01,000
So that it can kind of maintain that peg
by, super cool.

498
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Just like another, another version of it.

499
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And then this, Dexy Gold.

500
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So Dexy Gold is, I think maybe even
simpler, where it's just an auto,

501
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
arbitrage mechanism, right?

502
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So there's like a bank.

503
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So when this came out a long time ago, I
tried to make like a visual of it and this

504
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
could be totally wrong.

505
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So I would love for somebody to just kind
of make fun of me for not understanding.

506
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
This is a long time ago.

507
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Okay.

508
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So the Dexy I think works like this.

509
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:49,000
There's, there's like the bank where, it
can buy and sell, tokens out of this AMM.

510
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And that is reading the Oracle price for
gold.

511
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And so that's how it decides what to do.

512
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
If the price needs to go up or down to
match the price of gold, then it takes the

513
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
action in the AMM.

514
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And then users are able to interact with
the AMM.

515
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
So they're buying and selling.

516
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And then the fees go to the bank.

517
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So the bank's value is going to grow over
time and capacity will increase as users

518
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
use the protocol.

519
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
That's awesome.

520
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Yeah, I thought it was cool.

521
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So what's, I guess, the difference then
between Dexy and Gluon?

522
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So Gluon, it has that reserve.

523
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You're sending your ERG in and then
receiving these two tokens.

524
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And then the algorithm kind of balances
the value of those two and it has that

525
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
reserve token.

526
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Dexy doesn't have a reserve token.

527
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It's just, yeah, it's, how did he say it?

528
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
It's one token with like two protocols.

529
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So instead of two tokens with one
protocol on Gluon, interesting.

530
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah.

531
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So in Dexy, it's just like gold and ERG.

532
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And there's the bank doing stuff.

533
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And then there's the AMM doing stuff to
balance the price.

534
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
That's what I think.

535
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And I'd love to like, get some nuance.

536
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So maybe that's another episode in the
future.

537
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Yeah.

538
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Yeah, I think so.

539
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Because I have like a lot of questions
like, why would you want to have a reserve

540
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
like who who makes the reserve?

541
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So do you have to do like, initial
funding of it?

542
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And then there's builds the reserve
versus like, Dexy is looking at the bank,

543
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
in terms of gold.

544
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And then I would imagine, right, because
of the reserve token, there's probably

545
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
nuances to where you could do arbitrage
between these gold stable coins back to

546
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
back, because of how their mechanisms kind
of increase and decrease their prices.

547
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah, so I think, I think Dexy might
actually, I think you're right, like you

548
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
would have to kind of fund that bank.

549
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
But it eventually is like a locked
protocol.

550
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
It's a protocol owned liquidity there.

551
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Nobody owns that.

552
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
It's non-custodial.

553
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It's just locked in a contract that
operates autonomously.

554
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's not like somebody's ERG is sitting
in that bank.

555
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
That's what I think.

556
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But then how does the gold, I guess, work
into the play then?

557
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Because then, I guess, technically,
you're buying gold, right?

558
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
But then where's the actual gold I
suppose, come into play because wouldn't

559
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
in theory the bank buy real gold in order
to have, right?

560
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
In a real life thing, yes.

561
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So this is minting those tokens and the
value is represented in the AMM.

562
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
So it has ERG and the gold tokens and the
bank can mint gold tokens and buy and sell

563
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
those in the AMM.

564
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Right.

565
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I guess I'm confused on just like what
it's backed by.

566
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Like, well, how does it inherently hold?

567
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Yeah, just ERG and the Oracle.

568
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Okay.

569
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Interesting.

570
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It's well, I think it's similar to like
SigmaUSD, where it's like, it's just

571
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
algorithmic and like, yeah, is this worth
a dollar?

572
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's just a token.

573
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Right.

574
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
But since you can sell your SigmaUSD for
$1 worth of ERG, that's what makes it

575
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
valuable.

576
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
That's what like ensures its value.

577
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And so the same thing here, you're
getting this token that's like, yeah, it's

578
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
not real gold.

579
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Which would be really interesting.

580
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I would love to have like some warehouse
actually selling tokens that you could go

581
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
get.

582
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Right.

583
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yeah.

584
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Right.

585
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
But in this case, it's like, no, it's
just this autonomous protocol that will

586
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
give you the oracle price of gold in ERG
when you want it.

587
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So it's more of like a synthetic gold,
per se.

588
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So would the same be true for Gluon in
the reserve token?

589
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
But it would be more of like a synthetic,
but like with a reserve, I guess.

590
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And then that has its own, I guess,
inherent properties relative to, I guess.

591
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Yeah, so Dexy, I think, uses the users
mostly and the bank to buy and sell things

592
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
to maintain that price.

593
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And then Gluon uses the algorithm to kind
of tell you how much you can purchase

594
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
these for or redeem your reserve token
for.

595
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And that reserve token is going to go up
and down, kind of like exaggerated

596
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
movements of the ERG to BTC price.

597
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Right.

598
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
No, that's very fascinating because I
mean, imagine like, being able to do this

599
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
just for and I think that's kind of almost
where like, ChainCash comes into play to

600
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
where it's like, kind of take these models
of where it's like, okay, let's just get

601
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
rid of gold, it's abstract away.

602
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And then like, let's put like my house.

603
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And then you can like tokenize your house
and then sell certain aspects of your

604
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
house or whatever real world applications
actually make sense, I suppose, like

605
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
actual gold would be sick, like, Yeah,
here's my my warehouse of gold.

606
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
We've got 10 bars or whatever it is.

607
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And then that's what kind of how they're
doing with the which would be very similar

608
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
to the ETF, what they're doing with the
Bitcoin ETF, in some aspects.

609
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Dude.

610
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So funny that I've admitted this right
now.

611
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
On Twitter, I actually I spam Peter
Schiff and tell him that he should be

612
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
tokenizing his gold on the Ergo
blockchain.

613
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
He could sell it and earn.

614
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I mean, you could earn a 1% fee.

615
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Like, why don't you do that?

616
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And just every time someone needs to buy
or redeem their their gold token backed by

617
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
his gold, he owns a gold company.

618
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It's like, okay, but there you go, bro.

619
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Like you hate Bitcoin.

620
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Right?

621
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yeah.

622
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Does he like blockchain though?

623
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I don't know.

624
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I don't know.

625
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
His whole position is weird, because I
think like, the gold and Bitcoin value

626
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
proposition is just so similar.

627
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Like, yeah, like, why hate one or the
other?

628
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Totally.

629
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I was actually just thinking the other
day, I'm like, I should buy some gold,

630
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
like, that should be something, buy some
of those assets and silver, and uranium.

631
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
like.

632
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Okay, uranium.

633
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
That's why you have to let me know how to
buy that.

634
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Oh, just stocks, bro stocks.

635
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I don't actually own any uranium.

636
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Tim's building nukes out in Arizona.

637
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
My kids are gonna be weird.

638
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
You actually work for the CIA.

639
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So it's cool.

640
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
All right, brother.

641
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Is there is there anything else you
wanted to talk about today?

642
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
No, I think that we definitely talked a
lot and hit a lot of good, exciting

643
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
topics.

644
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So I mean, maybe we save it for the next
episode.

645
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Yeah.

646
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So just a disclaimer to everybody.

647
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I don't know what I'm talking about.

648
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I'm just a guy and I like to read a lot.

649
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I don't understand everything perfectly.

650
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So if me and Mark get something wrong,
I'd love to learn and you can be a guest

651
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
