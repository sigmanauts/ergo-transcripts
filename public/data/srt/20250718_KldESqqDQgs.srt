1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Good morning, kushti.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hello. How's it going?

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Good, good. Good morning. Yeah, you have
a good morning.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yeah. I cashed out everything. I'm
totally out of the game and I bought a

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
private yacht. I'm out here on the ocean.
Just kidding.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yeah, good morning. I'm with my family on
a vacation for the week at a beautiful

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
lake. I'm up before everybody else up on
the roof of one of the houses and just

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
joining the AMA to talk about Ergo today,
kushti, how about you?

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah, so hot here and yeah well doing a
bit slowly due to weather and the location

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:23,000
so I'm back from Dubai. So in Dubai it was
especially hard to work.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's gotta seem cold where you are now
compared to Dubai.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah, indeed. Probably like most places
of the planet, right? It's quite cold in

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,000
comparison. But anyway, so they're doing a
lot of things. So working for 6.0, working

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:56,000
with Machina in turn, then continuing some
blogs.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
While polishing things, improving
consent. And yeah, well, I think we can do

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,000
public testnet mining sub-blocks
supporting nodes in July. Then writing a

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,000
white paper for first merge mined
sidechain. So something like that.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
When is voting done, kushti?

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So it seems there is 90 plus percent
support. So then we will see 6.0

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
activation around October. And yeah, we
can think about sub-blocks after. So yeah

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
well let's try public testnet first and
then consider mainnet activation time

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
frame.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That'll be good. Is there any what's it
called? I remember there was talk about

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
not a hackathon, but maybe a mini
hackathon where projects that are more

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
open source could be funded to integrate
sub-blocks into them. Things that maybe

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
don't have a hosted interface, those kind
of things could be modified to support

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
sub-blocks.

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So that would be something interesting
that could happen in the future for the

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
community members looking to bolster some
of those projects. I'm sure things like

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Mew and Nautilus and those kind of things,
those devs will update it themselves if

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
they feel free to take part in that kind
of thing.

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah, so I think it's mostly about DEXes,
right? And applications like that, which

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
will be boosted mostly. So I believe that
for auctions, two blocks are okay, right?

34
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Then for bonds and so on. So for loans
even, right?

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So when you can provide a loan to some
farmers in Kenya in like two minutes, then

36
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
it's already quite... That's not fast
enough, kushti. It's already quite

37
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
mind-blowing, right? So you can do that in
like two seconds instead of two minutes.

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's not really changing anything because
anyway, they will cash it out in like two

39
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
days after. They need to reach some
peer-to-peer exchange booth. So some

40
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
middlemen in the town nearby. So yeah,
something like that.

41
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But for DEXes, right, so for things we
are completely virtual. Yeah, maybe. That

42
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
doesn't matter.

43
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And I think if people have... Yeah, so if
people have, I think it should be enabled

44
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
by default, actually. In Nautilus, if
people have enable zero config turned on,

45
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
it shows transactions before they're
settled in your wallet.

46
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So from a UX standpoint, it brings a
point of more instantaneous transfers when

47
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
you're working on the DEXes or when you're
trying to transfer things to somebody. And

48
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
with chain TXs, I mean, we're not talking
about finality here, but we're talking

49
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
about user experience.

50
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It really feels the same when I'm bombing
through a DEX swap and then I'm sending

51
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
that, like when I had to exit through
SimpleSwap or Rosen Bridge to pull some

52
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
funds out for funding something for
Sigmanauts.

53
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Just using that, you could just chain
some transactions together. And for the UX

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
experience with zero config, it felt
instantaneous, right? But overall I had to

55
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
wait the blocks to do it in the
background. So yeah, that's interesting.

56
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I wonder if, applied by default, kushti,
if that would have a speed mentality

57
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
increase for the users that are new here
in Ergo. Essentially, they might not be

58
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
able to understand chain transactions, but
if to them it looks like they do a swap,

59
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
oh, their funds are already there, oh, I
could spend those funds somewhere else.

60
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Do they need to dig in to know that chain
transactions, that's how it's working in

61
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
the background, or finality, the
difference between the two? I don't know.

62
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, but I think in 2025, what users are
mostly paying attention to is distribution

63
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:16,000
of token, right? Because it seems more and
more are centralized trash coins, right?

64
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So it's a little bit different environment
than in 2024.

65
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
First, they tried to find some existing
meme coins, but meme coins are also

66
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
well-scheming, like all of them.

67
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The thing that gets me is people at
central exchanges that have grown the

68
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
culture in the environment right now in
mainstream crypto and then you see them

69
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
bitching on chain online but on Twitter or
other places about how you need serious

70
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
projects and utility and things like that.

71
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm like guys, you spend years just
soaking money out of these rug pulls and

72
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,000
community and now you're like, oh we need
crypto that actually does something. But

73
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
also they just talking right. So when you
see what they're doing here, it's somewhat

74
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:46,000
different also.

75
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah, so for sidechains development,
yeah, well, I will share first updates.

76
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Well, in the coming weeks, probably, we
can start to do such things. So currently,

77
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:17,000
there is a repository stop, right, and
white paper and progress spots.

78
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, well, with like a few developers,
we can accelerate things greatly. Then

79
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:37,000
yeah what else so a lot of things going on
no not just about sub-blocks right and

80
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:46,000
well I don't know so this is quite
important thing right but yeah, well, in

81
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:55,000
2025, it seems that there are a lot of
important things.

82
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Well, people do pay attention to things
like distribution and so on.

83
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So I think that stuff is somewhat picking
up. Yeah, it's slow. Not as fast as you'd

84
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
like right, but I don't know. I think
people are ignorant to on purpose, right?

85
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
They'll claim for that. They'll claim to
start looking into fair distribution,

86
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
miner rights, those kind of things and
then at the same time.

87
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's like the distracted girlfriend meme
where you're walking along with fair

88
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
distribution and open source and peer to
peer and then four coin walks by and jerk

89
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
your head to take a peek kind of thing.

90
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So I feel that stuff's always tempting
with the majority of the ecosystem,

91
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
unfortunately. But I mean, the trick is to
be steady, be strong and continue to build

92
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
like we're doing and exhibiting the proper
principles that matter all along.

93
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh, another news, kushti. Drama. We need
to have our feature drama today. So our

94
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
drama of the week is, if you guys
remember, I told Joe to go break something

95
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
last week. Well, he broke his own Twitter
account. He got banned somehow. So Joe is

96
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
officially banned off Twitter again. He's
going to have to make a new account and

97
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
get it back. We'll see how long that takes
him.

98
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But wait, so it's Joe's personal account,
which is bad.

99
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Joe's personal account. We don't dare
give him the main account anymore, kushti.

100
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's too dangerous. So he's trying to get
that back. We'll see how long that takes.

101
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But yeah, maybe they'll let him broadcast
out of Rosen Bridge for now. We'll see.

102
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Alright, what else is new, kushti? Any
news on Ergo Raffle 2.0? Is that still

103
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
kicking around at some point for a
release?

104
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh, Raffle? I don't know. I need to check
with the guys. Not recently. Let me check.

105
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So yeah, we now have a DAO, right? DAO
breach. So we do. Bring DAO if you have.

106
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So we need now for LPs, right? And we'll
start to do things.

107
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yep. So Joe's team is working on
Hummingbot, which hopefully should help

108
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
with a lot of community run LP. So I feel
that's going to be a really nice change as

109
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
opposed to large finances popping an LP
that can pop and remove them just as easy

110
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
as they put them there.

111
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's going to be nice to see bridge
liquidity spread across ecosystems with

112
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
community-run liquidity. I think that's
the best option, spread it out. Not only

113
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
spread out the liquidity to different
bridges, but you're also spreading it out.

114
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So if I put in $500 into liquidity across
with Hummingbot, and kushti puts in

115
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
$1,000, and it just repeats that way for
5,000 users, I feel that's a better

116
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
liquidity spread than a few large heavy
hitters pumping in liquidity or even the

117
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
project itself pumping in liquidity.

118
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's got more lasting power. It's less
big waves, more stability. So I'm really,

119
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:48,000
really looking forward to that, kushti,
getting that hummingbot up for Rosen.

120
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
All right. And then there are some
initiatives, right, from Rosen to Watson.

121
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Can you provide details?

122
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
We've got to mention that again. Yeah,
guys. Guys, so there are five initiatives

123
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
up now in the discussion form of Paideia.
And Rosen team has invited you. The Rosen

124
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
guards have invited you to take part in
that discussion, whether it be on the

125
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Paideia platform.

126
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
We've made it a discussion, so anybody
can comment on the Paideia discussions

127
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
without being a member. You just need a
wallet, that's it. And then Glasgow's made

128
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
an article on the Ergo platform website
explaining brief summaries over the

129
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
positions that those five are taking and
encourage discussion as well on there on

130
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
the socials, telegram, discord, and
Paideia as well from the website.

131
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So please guys, please, this is Ergo
where we try to be as active as we can

132
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
instead of being a passive. If you're an
investor, instead of being passive

133
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
investors, be active investors.

134
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Take your Sunday morning coffee and read
one of those proposals per day and put a

135
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
comment. Even if you like, that looks
great, Joe's a genius, I love what Joe's

136
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
saying here, I don't disagree with
anything. Just put a little thumbs up in

137
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
the discussion there, just so we see that
engagement and we get those reality checks

138
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and those sanity checks.

139
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So engage, even if it's positive. And of
course, engage if it's negative too. If

140
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
there's something that you're like, this
is not going to work because of this, or I

141
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
think there's a better way than engage.
Let's be a chain full of engagers, guys.

142
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Let's do that, please.

143
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So those are from Paideia. If you can't
find them, go to the Ergo Platform website

144
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
or check out a couple posts before on the
Twitter page, on our Twitter account, the

145
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Ergo Platform Twitter account. We've got
them all listed there with links to all

146
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
the proposals.

147
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So that's, for those not aware of what
those are, there's several different

148
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
options across the five of them. One of
them is specifically what a lot of you are

149
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
interested in, and that is getting
Rosen-ERG in the hands of many, many

150
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
people on the Cardano chains via airdrops,
via pickups, those kind of things.

151
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And the idea there would be to create a
wallet threshold of holders on Cardano so

152
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
that Kraken, with their latest arbitrarily
statement of how many wallets it takes to

153
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
get listed, will hopefully meet that goal
and initiate a listing on Kraken with at

154
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
least Rosen ERG for starters.

155
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So please read those proposals, comment,
even if that's the only proposal you

156
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
comment on, just show some initiative and
engagement and hop in there and do that,

157
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
please.

158
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
All right. So how things are going with
Sigmanauts and just so, well, InfraDAO

159
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
proposal. So we will check after the.

160
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeah, I just pushed out a little update
of some more details about the InfraDAO.

161
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
We've got enough people for the initial
machine handout. We've got four or five

162
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
people interested. So for those people,
I'm hard baking a machine, cloning it from

163
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
the three machines that are running right
now in the InfraDAO, and we'll ship them

164
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
out.

165
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
They'll hook them up. We'll point the
load balancers to them based on their

166
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
internet connection bandwidth, what
percentage we'll point to them. Once those

167
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
are running and everything's working well,
then we will start opening up to other

168
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
people.

169
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
We'll say, hey, if you have this much
bandwidth, if you have this kind of

170
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
machine and this much RAM and this much
storage, and you have an external facing

171
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
IP, you can open up ports, you can run a
little command line and configs and those

172
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
kind of things, then please join the DAO.

173
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And then we'll eventually, hopefully,
have the full circumference of the globe

174
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
mapped out with ergo nodes so that if
you're in Africa and you're trying to

175
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
submit a transaction or go through the
Explorer. You're actually hitting an

176
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Explorer that's on your continent or that
kind of thing.

177
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So that's the end goal there as well as
of course taking the responsibility away

178
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
from the EF so they don't have to keep
bleeding money into unofficially hosted

179
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
ergo-infra-DAO. But excited about that.
That's gonna be great. We'll make nodes

180
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
great again, kushti.

181
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So they also published some new ideas on
the forum such as global transfer policies

182
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
for a sidechain which is kind of a solar
punk on steroids kind of idea probably but

183
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
yeah I still need to explain this.

184
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Then yeah so for sub-blocks I think,
well, there is need to explain how it is

185
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
designed and done for more, right? So we
will do it in coming weeks, maybe with

186
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:34,000
some videos. Let's see. We'll try to find
time for that.

187
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
How's, kushti, how's any progress on
ChainCash? How's that going? Is that the

188
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
back burner for now?

189
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So there is some contributor which is
operating the chat just today so that I'm

190
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:02,000
going to review some pull requests but
yeah in general so well currently the

191
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,000
biggest obstacle is to consider some real
world use case right so what could be that

192
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and well do UI's accordingly right.

193
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So well it's kind of low-level financial
like primitive from meta-primitive so well

194
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,000
it's kind of assembly language right for
different financial monetary system so we

195
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:44,000
need to find some concrete instantiations,
right, not just to do some abstract work,

196
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
right, to get done, because it's a little
bit weird approach, but they're popular in

197
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,000
crypto probably, right, just to throw
something.

198
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So I think we need to go from the needs
of the real world. Yeah, well, it could be

199
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:18,000
done differently to change the best
monitoring system from community

200
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:27,000
currencies rights to some international
trade currencies for corporations even

201
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:36,000
states rights. Well, we need some
counterparties interested in deploying all

202
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:45,000
those things.

203
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Then we can do UIs. I think it's more or
less straightforward once a niche is

204
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
considered. We can proceed. I think it
would boost the usage of ergo-escalatorial

205
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
holes.

206
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Initially, we had DeFi, stablecoin, DEX,
then bridge, cross-chain. Grip, right, of

207
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:32,000
ERGs to collaterals of different kinds.
Then, now we can do more. So, well, ergo

208
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:43,000
can go into kind of treasuries, right,
backing collateral, backing instruments

209
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:54,000
for community trades and international
trade even.

210
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So this would be quite huge, right? In
comparison with DeFi sandbox. I mean,

211
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,000
those four funny games on the blockchain.

212
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I think I'm getting rained on in a sec.
We'll see what happens. Darn it. I have to

213
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
go under an umbrella. What happened to,
what's it called? Wasn't there somebody

214
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
working on a Hawala system on Ergo? Was it
Jami'i with cups of sugar somewhat?

215
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So, with Jami'i, we just did some
experience. But yeah, I think Jami'i just

216
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
sold some honey, right? And that's it. And
he's still selling something and trying to

217
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
sell something.

218
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So, what about the reverse of that,
kushti? What about physical to digital

219
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
conversions the other way? Not even a real
pawn shop, but what if there was a way to

220
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
on ramp with physical goods? Converting
physical goods to digital money.

221
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So like let's say there was a shop
somewhere that just like a pawn shop, but

222
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:29,000
yeah I guess like a physical pawn shop
that converts your goods to digital.

223
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
What's the, so why do you need four
Hawala like tools there?

224
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
No, this is a little bit separate from
Hawala tools there. It's kind of the same

225
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
idea. So a trusted storefront essentially.
So if there was a storefront set up to

226
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
where you knew that if you sent them your
old X-Box, they might give you 70% of the

227
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
market value of it or 60% of the market
value of it, but you would definitely get

228
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
ERG sent to you as soon as it arrived and
they checked it out kind of thing.

229
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
So that would be, I guess a trust of
Hawala would need to be there. But yeah.

230
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:13,000
There is a GitCircles project from my
friend, which is about creating community

231
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
currencies for Git projects. For one
project, you have a dedicated community

232
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:29,000
currency created for contributions to open
source software. Actually, he has a

233
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:37,000
specification done and it will be
published in the coming days. He sent me a

234
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:45,000
specification a few days ago.

235
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It looks good. It will be published in
the coming days. I think there are a lot

236
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:03,000
of ways to use different techniques for
creating different kinds of monetary

237
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:12,000
financial tools, fundraising tools. So
that's what we are doing.

238
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I don't know, two years to the moment,
three years, but yeah, well, it's time to

239
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
scale up, I guess, right, all those
efforts and to do them in different

240
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
environments, so digital, like those Git
project currencies, right, and yeah, also

241
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
physical, digital, so yeah, well,
reviving.

242
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Have ideas on digital level and so on.
Getting back to free banking now on

243
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
digital rails.

244
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah, I had an interesting conversation
with somebody the other day that was

245
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
visiting our place, a friend of a friend
kind of thing. And with the price of

246
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
certain coins going pretty high lately,
everybody in your grandmother is like,

247
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
should I buy? Should I buy? What should I
buy? That kind of thing.

248
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So I am classically never, ever giving
out advice on whatever to buy. I just

249
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
speak about what we do and what others do
and that kind of stuff. And that's about

250
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
as much as info as I'll give people.

251
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But it was really interesting trying to
talk to them about the difference between

252
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
what Bitcoin is right now and what it was
and what things are like the projects we

253
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
work on, kushti, here in Ergo. It's
really, I suggest you guys try it, people

254
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
listening, try to have that conversation
with people that don't know much about

255
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
crypto.

256
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And it'll be an interesting one for
yourself, that's for sure. They'll ask

257
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
why, why are you doing this? What's the
purpose of this? Why can't you just do

258
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
this with other tools out there on the web
and that kind of stuff.

259
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It really makes, it really hones your
ability to understand why it's important

260
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
to do it transparently on chain
permissionless and those kinds of things.

261
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And if you do it right, you can somewhat
convince the other people that it makes

262
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
sense. So it's a very interesting
conversation.

263
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yeah. So I think with global transfer
policies, it could be made quite clear,

264
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
right? So well, the idea is that then
everyone can run on CBDC basically, right?

265
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So well, fully controlled monitoring
circuit, right?

266
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And then the question, the only question
here remains if this kind of tooling per

267
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:53,000
se is permissionless, right? Because if
not, if consensus is permissioned, right?

268
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:01,000
To some degree, maybe to any degree even.

269
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So then you are ending up with some kind
of dystopia, right? It's like CBDC is not

270
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,000
for everyone, right? Only for central
banks and their friends. So for some

271
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:23,000
foundation, right? Shady foundation,
controlling some digital private currency

272
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,000
basically with tooling on top of it.

273
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:41,000
But yeah so if it's about permissionless
environment right and then it's not so big

274
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:52,000
deal right it's not so disturbing I guess
if like everyone can do on monetary

275
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:03,000
circuits right if you even if they are
closed or well like have some kind of

276
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:14,000
control even full control of all the
operations right so still well if it's a

277
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:25,000
tooling available to like everyone then
what's the issue so then it's done.

278
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Okay. And that's basically what do you
have in all the cryptocurrency, right? But

279
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
now it's made to extreme just, right? So
we already have stable coins with black

280
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
lists, right? So we have certain
cryptocurrencies even applying blacklists,

281
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
right, on the consensus level.

282
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So then there is need to define, right,
when it's not going to be harmful to

283
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:15,000
everyone, right. And I think it's about
that. It could be about that after all. So

284
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:25,000
you need for permissionless consensus,
right?

285
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Right. And I think in this conversation,
I had the kind of sticking point, not

286
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
sticking point, but the thing that was
really attractive to this person was the

287
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
fact that you go to a bank and you say,
look, I'm renting for $2,000 a month this

288
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
apartment.

289
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'd like to buy a house and my payment is
$1,700 a month with this loan in your

290
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
interest. And the bank's like, nah, I'm
sorry. No thanks. Kind of thing. And

291
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
you're like, look, I have the collateral
lives and I have the income level here to

292
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
pay $2,000 a month just fine. Why aren't
you letting me buy a house for $1,700 a

293
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
month lending me?

294
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So I think what attracted about this in
this conversation to this guy about Ergo,

295
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
at least, is that crypto in general, is
that those kind of things are contract

296
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
based permissionless, right? I said you
can go to SigmaFi. Let's say ERG is

297
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
dipping and you want to take out a loan of
SigmaUSD so you can reinvest or whatnot?

298
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And I said you just go to a website I
said you put up your collateral choose

299
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
your own interest and make it juicy enough
for somebody to jump into and you click a

300
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
button I said the contract collects your
funds and post it up there for somebody to

301
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
see and then even on top of that the
attractive thing was like you know what

302
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
happens if like my freaking bank just went
through a name change right like what a

303
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
pain in the ass the apps change everything
changes it's just a bunch of bullcrap.

304
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I said, with this kind of stuff on chain
and permissionless, it doesn't matter. I

305
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
said, you could either pay a couple
hundred bucks to a dev to spin one up from

306
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
the GitHub or have ChatGPT help you out,
spin it up on your own machine to spin up

307
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
the front end interface.

308
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Go ahead and liquidate the loan kind of
thing or repay your loan based on that.

309
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
The idea that finance is unstoppable,
private, but also transparent and in your

310
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
own control, I think is something that
hopefully more and more people wake up to

311
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
every day.

312
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Yeah, yeah. And so you can do also your
own currency, like QXUSD, right, with your

313
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
own rules. Well, your community may have
very different rules, which could be OK

314
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,000
for your community, for example, maybe
restrictive for others. But why should you

315
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,000
care, right, if it's just, well.

316
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Right, I could see bad things happening
too, kushti, though. I could see

317
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
corporations inventing their own, or
minting their own stable coin, paying

318
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
their employees in their own stable coin,
and not letting, and nobody else really

319
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
accepting it on a further basis, so that
you have to kind of buy things at your own

320
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
place.

321
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
That happened in the US. They call them,
what was it, wooden nickels back in the

322
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
day, right? Or something town, what was it
called? That miner town where they paid

323
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
them in their own currency and then you
could only spend that currency on rent and

324
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
at the general store in the miners town so
you basically had nothing at the end of it

325
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
you were enslaved.

326
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Right so yeah I mean that's quite a
common story happened around the world.

327
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Yeah, so around late 19th century. Yeah,
it was quite common I believe around the

328
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,000
globe right to have this kind of factory
currency. So you're selling it and then

329
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,000
buy only in factory store. But Rosen
Bridge to the rescue right let's bring him

330
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,000
on to another chain pull that liquidity
off and.

331
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But yeah, I mean, evil is going to exist
either way. What have we got for

332
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
questions?

333
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I mean, at least you have here freedom to
switch right to another currency just in a

334
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
matter of seconds. I mean to work for
another currency at least, right? You

335
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
spare time and then to switch completely.

336
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Right, and it's not difficult for other
entities to accept that kind of digital

337
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
currency as compared to in the past where
it was a wooden nickel or something like

338
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
that.

339
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Yes, so I think in comparison with late
19th century here, environment here is

340
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
quite different.

341
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I could see Amazon blacklisting the hell
out of there.

342
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Right, right. But then you can blacklist
Amazon dollars, right, also in your

343
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:32,000
financial circuit. So it could be, then
very fragmented. But also, also, you are

344
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:40,000
not so controlled. I mean, not so
everything can be controlled at least,

345
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:48,000
right?

346
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Unlike ubiquitous financial systems,
especially digital ones. Yeah, let's see.

347
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But hopefully, it would be better when you
can have freedom to make your own

348
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:18,000
contractual, for financial contracts,
contractual monetary circuit, stuff like

349
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:28,000
that.

350
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I think it's brilliant for companies to
come out with their own stable issued

351
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
coins, right?

352
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That's what they're already doing, right?

353
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
No, no, I think it's great. I think if
they want to give the community, not the

354
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
community, if they want to give investors
an opportunity to hold something stable

355
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
that is a belief in that company's ability
to maintain a stable, then by all means,

356
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
go for it. That's great. You know might
get some competition to well, I mean

357
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
everything's pegged to the damn dollar,
but be nice.

358
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
kushti, we got a question for you ready.
All right. It's from Alex T. Co-mining

359
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
with Bitcoin. Can you speak to this a bit?
They feel huge potential to integrate with

360
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
existing BTC farms and act as a co-mine
smart layer. I know you and Joe are

361
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
talking about this quite a bit. Can you go
into detail at all on how that would work?

362
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
What's kind of mining with Bitcoin?
Sorry.

363
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
So essentially co-mining an ergo
sidechain with Bitcoin on ASIC miners, I

364
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
guess, would be the question.

365
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
But yeah, so currently the idea is to
have double merge mined sidechain rights

366
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
with design like Ergo, right? So inputted
and ordering blocks, like after

367
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
sub-blocks. But ordering blocks are
committed on Bitcoin blockchain, right?

368
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And they're also committing to additional
data structures for Bitcoin blockchain,

369
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:15,000
such as digest of Bitcoin UTXO set,
including OP_RETURN outputs and also we

370
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:23,000
can add NIPoPoWs of their right for
Bitcoin blockchain.

371
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:30,000
So then with that data committed by a
subset of Bitcoin miners, you can have

372
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
access in different contracts so to
bitcoin you take source right so you can

373
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:44,000
do rgb like protocols you can have NIPoPoW
clients for bitcoin right and so on then

374
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,000
yeah you also have input blocks which are
committed on ergo blockchain so on ergo

375
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,000
input blocks.

376
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Then yeah like every block in
double-merged mine sidechain is

377
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:12,000
proof-of-work backed. Also, the state from
both blockchains are brought to that

378
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,000
sidechain to be used in DeFi, so it's
about trustless back with Ergo. As shown

379
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:26,000
in ErgoHack 7 submission.

380
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Then it could be trustless pack with
Bitcoin using Bitcoin bridge. How do they

381
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:48,000
call it? Bridgeless, something like that.
So B2M2 based. It seems B2M3 is broken at

382
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:58,000
the moment. But for B2M2 there are already
a few competing implementations.

383
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And then so then you may have trustless
transfers with two blockchains, right?

384
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Well, a possibility to use all the ergo,
almost all the ergo DeFi tooling right on

385
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:30,000
this side chain and so on. So would be a
good solution for Bitcoin DeFi, I believe.

386
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Very cool. Yeah, I won't say it. No, I'll
move on. I won't say it. We'll keep going.

387
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Let's see what else we have. Is it raining
on your site? No, it's not raining yet.

388
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's a big everybody. It's a very pretty
lake that I'm at, but it's going to rain

389
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
in like 10 minutes.

390
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
No, it's going to rain at 11. I think I
have another hour before it rains because

391
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
she should be safe. All right. All right,
let's see Oh, Richie's getting more

392
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
specific is there a double merge mining
are there double merge mining coins in

393
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
existence? How can you solve a block for
Autolykos and SHA-256 with a single hash

394
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
calculation.

395
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Oh. But so well Bitcoin miners are
working on Bitcoin mining along with

396
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Bitcoin merged, let's say, blocks, while
ergo miners are working on ergo mining

397
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:54,000
along with ergo merged blocks on that
sidechain. So they just need to read data

398
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:03,000
from other blocks to refer to them.

399
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:15,000
About other implementations, I'm not
actually quite sure. Need to check. Yeah,

400
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:26,000
maybe not even, so it would be the first
one.

401
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
We've got a question from Hermes, and
that is, can you explain Lithos like I'm a

402
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
dummy? ELI-5, Lithos, kushti.

403
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:44,000
So, Lithos is decentralized mining
protocol. So it's kind of a decentralized

404
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:53,000
pool, which is backed by contracts on ergo
or blockchain. But also that's done

405
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:02,000
efficiently, right? So well, in a rollup
like way.

406
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
So well, look at these things. Look at
those old boats. Aren't those beautiful?

407
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Where's my finger? Yeah. There we go.
There we go. There's a whole house of

408
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
them. Yeah, these old like boats from the
turn of the century, kind of these woodies

409
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
they call them.

410
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Yeah, so essentially it's finding a way
to instead of current mining is done by

411
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,000
reporting to a local server on a pool and
solve that way. But right, Lithos

412
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,000
integrates putting your effort proof on
chain itself by the individual miner.

413
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And also it's efficient, so there were
some attempts to do contract-based

414
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:57,000
decentralized mining pools for Ethereum,
but it was just some theoretical paper.

415
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Done like eight years ago and so for
bitcoin they had a p2p pool but it was

416
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:15,000
kind of sidechain for bitcoin and it
wasn't big but also wasn't efficient right

417
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:24,000
for miners to work with dedicated
sidechain for pooled mining just.

418
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:34,000
So here are also efficient.

419
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
We've got, we've got saying how easy will
it be to build with the sigma chain? Will

420
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
there be a modular templates? It's a kind
of like pump fun where you can push and

421
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
pump out your own side chain.

422
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Right, so yeah, there will be some
library available to easily build merge

423
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:01,000
mined sidechains. So then it would be the
question also how to make miners, mining

424
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:08,000
pools to pick them easily, right? Because
you can launch sidechain, but if it's

425
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:15,000
merged mine, then it should be supported
by mining pools.

426
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Then there is need for some easy tool for
mining puzzles, right? And we will do

427
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
that. So it should be like UI, right?
Where they just, pick chains they like and

428
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
mine them along with them.

429
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
That'd be cool, the era of pump fun
mining, where instead of pumping fun and

430
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
hitting a liquidity pool with the tokens
and having people buy them, you're trying

431
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
to entice GPU miners to mine your chain.
As you put it, that'd be really damn cool

432
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
to see, kushti.

433
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Yeah, the biggest meme coin is mineable,
right? It's actually a merge mined side

434
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:02,000
chain of Litecoin. Right, so the Dogecoin,
which I'm talking about, is a merge mined

435
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:09,000
side chain of Litecoin. And it's bigger by
market capitalization than the home chain,

436
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:16,000
right, the main chain, than the Litecoin
itself.

437
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But it's also helping Litecoin a lot, I
believe, because at least for security

438
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:34,000
budget, it is helping a lot, right, to
Litecoin. And actually before Dogecoin

439
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:42,000
there were a few other merge mined
sidechains of meme kind so it was bells

440
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:50,000
then cats and then Dogecoin after cats but
somehow Dogecoin became popular and bells

441
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:58,000
and cats not.

442
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:08,000
But yeah, I believe Bells was the first
meme sidechain. But with programmable

443
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:15,000
money capabilities, you can do a lot,
actually, also, right? So you can launch

444
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:22,000
your meme sidechain, but also you have,
some rules of your own, right, for this

445
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:29,000
sidechain.

446
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:37,000
But what could that be about, I need to
think. Yeah, could be something funny,

447
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:43,000
right, if it's meme. Yeah, of course.

448
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
All right, let's see. We've got Luke
saying, would it be worthwhile to extend

449
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Nautilus and become multi-chain if it also
has Bitcoin and Cardano natives, then it

450
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
may attract new users and make an
interesting interface for Rosen. I had

451
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
thought Nautilus's mission was to follow
Rosen, or maybe that was Minotaur, but I

452
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
thought it was Nautilus as well.

453
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I'm pretty sure that's what it was.
kushti, is that what you remember as well?

454
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
They were going to follow the chains that
Rosen eventually went to?

455
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I'm not sure.

456
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
That's what I thought, because that was
his work on MetaMask and integrating into

457
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
that and that kind of stuff, from what I
remember.

458
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Minotaur, recently they improved things
like MultiSig and privacy-related things,

459
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
so not done.

460
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Multisig on Minotaur is fantastic. I've
said it a long time ago, but I'll keep

461
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
saying it. Like the Sigmanaut
transactions, we can bang them out in

462
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
like, if everybody's paying attention in
our channel, we can bang them out in 10,

463
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
20 minutes. It's super fast, super nice.
Things are saved now so you can go back.

464
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
There's still room to mess up, of course,
but once you get the hang of it, it's very

465
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,000
efficient and very nice. So once again,
that's a 2.0 version of Minotaur.

466
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Right but also the improving things
greatly our time so in comparison with

467
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:14,000
early versions. So much easier now, so try
it. It's actually, well, a great way to do

468
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:21,000
just simplest DAO, right?

469
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:30,000
So you can just have multisig wallet and
some forum or chat and that's all ready.

470
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Kind of DAO, right? And I think in many
cases, actually, simplicity, well, it's

471
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:48,000
bringing some advantages, right? Like
flexibility, for example.

472
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:57,000
So if you just have some telegram chat
and RTC quality, then it's super simple

473
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:06,000
and flexible. Then if you need for
something more professional, professional

474
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:15,000
looking you may try Paideia right but for
starters if you just need to run some DAO

475
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:24,000
with your friends kind of cooperative then
just multisig and some chat maybe some

476
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:33,000
forum it's quite good.

477
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Well, speaking of that kind of stuff,
MGPai was telling me something that he did

478
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
with his roommates. That was pretty neat.
They all mint their own token, right? So

479
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
they all mint, let's say, 500 tokens. The
MGPai token is a Bill token is a John

480
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
token.

481
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And then for utilities and things like
that, they send a token to that person

482
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
that they need to pay and then at the end
of the semester when everything's purse

483
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
are built and every funds come in come out
for scholarships and those kind of things

484
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
they look at their wallets and they're
like okay I've got 255 MGPai's in my

485
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
wallet. You owe me 255 bucks MGPai and
that kind of thing.

486
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
So they settle up after in the cycles
essentially. Instead of like piece by

487
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
piece, they settle up at the end in
cycles. So I thought that was a pretty

488
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
interesting way to use a blockchain and
use tokens and wallets. So bravo to MGPai

489
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
for coming up with that. Pretty cool.

490
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Oh yeah, that's interesting actually.
Yeah, so this kind of LETS right but

491
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
exactly. Yeah, but blockchain based and so
your local exchange trading system For

492
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
you're not trusting it's not like your
buddies coming to you and saying hey, I

493
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
built this app that's gonna track our
finances. You can use it, but you can't

494
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
see any of the back end. Just trust me. So
the blockchain really puts an end to that.

495
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,000
That's a great use of it.

496
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Right, but also if you have roommates,
then you can put some SigmaUSD, for

497
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
example, right? And come and treasury and
then I have multisig like two out of three

498
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
multisig for you.

499
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I grill on the deck.

500
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Yeah, for you or room number 57. That's
quite funny.

501
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,000
All right, let's see. We got one more
question. Here we go. This is from Hermes

502
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
again. One additional question from him.
I'm an embedded software engineer, but I

503
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
want to get into blockchain development.
What's the best place to start learning

504
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
how to develop on Ergo platform?

505
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Oh, yeah. So jump on the main chat, maybe
even later today. So I think actually to

506
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,000
discuss some possibilities. So if you are
embedded platform dev, maybe you know Rust

507
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
already, right? And then recently,

508
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I found some Rust developers in the main
chat, which are not contributing yet, so

509
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:21,000
we can discuss doing something like Git
circles, ChainCash, and then this merge

510
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:28,000
mine sidechains framework would be done in
Rust, right?

511
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Yeah, well, a lot of things
application-wise and then, but Merge Mined

512
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Side Chains even more like core
development, maybe a little bit. But then

513
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:50,000
you can go to core developments with Rust,
like touching Ergo Rust and so on. We have

514
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:57,000
some tasks there.

515
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:05,000
That there is need to improve some
bindings, like Python bindings, for

516
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:12,000
example, and so on. So you can say hi in
the main Telegram group, which is bridged

517
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:19,000
with Discord. General channel also. The
main Telegram group is called

518
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:26,000
ergo-space-platform.

519
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:38,000
You can find links on the website
ergoplatform.org. Then probably on Twitter

520
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:47,000
right and so on so say hi then let's
continue the incoming hours then there is

521
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:56,000
also ergo development group but my thought
was to use general for a chart what's

522
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:05,000
what's to get feedback on what could be
useful for community as well in the first

523
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:14,000
place and what could be a focus for
contributors.

524
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Then how all those things could be
accounted for and rewarded, also another

525
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:30,000
good question. But at some point, we can
start to use Git circles to reward, to

526
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:38,000
make accounting at least for contributors.
And then for rewarding, well, there are

527
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:46,000
different options like raffles and so on.

528
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:56,000
But if it's about Merchant Mined
sidechains, then it's potentially about

529
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:06,000
creating a lot of tokens also. Some of
them may be successful. Like Dogecoin.

530
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:16,000
What else? Some Bitcoin sidechains got
quite successful also. In past times and

531
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:26,000
nowadays also.

532
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
So far, so good. It's two minutes past
the hour. The sun's coming out. I've got

533
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
my swimsuit on. I jump in.

534
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Yes. So yeah, I see you're looking
outside, right? So you are willing to wrap

535
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:51,000
up the may probably, right. And enjoy the
summer. So any news in regards with the

536
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:59,000
meetup?

537
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
No, I think we just retweeted it the
other day. We're doing another retweet.

538
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
But no new news yet, nope.

539
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:20,000
All right, all right. So yeah, so far so
good. So let's catch up, guys. Our

540
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Telegram and Discord chat.

541
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
We'll see you guys around chats. See you
same time next week.

542
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
See you guys.
