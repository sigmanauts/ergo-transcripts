1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Welcome to the Ergo Proof of Work
Community AMA, today hosted from Sunny.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Ithaca, my house.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I decided to come in late to work today
so we can host it from the house with us

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
today.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We've got a couple people joining us
right off the bat.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We've got Kushti, we've got Aberg, which
reminds me of that Hamilton song, A.burr,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
right?

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Aaron.burr.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Then we've got Byron as well joining us.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Good morning, everybody.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And Kushti, how are you guys doing today?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Doing perfect so 6.0 activated
successfully so it was totally a flawless

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
experience so yeah I had the chance to
sleep well and so on so yeah it's very

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
well around them and so yeah well we are
discussing talks on what to do next so

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
sub-blocks development and so on maybe we
will share some thoughts and yeah a lot of

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
talks around now is about marketing
community marketing efforts so let's have

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
the call maybe focused on that
specifically if there is demand to discuss

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
that specifically because about that

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, I mean, that's always needed. It's
always hard to kick start something in the

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
community from the grassroots with
marketing when you don't throw thousands

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and thousands of dollars at it, right?

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I think it's actually maybe easier
because when you throw money, then yes,

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
some marketing agencies creating some
ordinary crap, right? Like, I don't know,

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Super Booper Web3 project. AI slot kind of
stuff doing not known what's but super

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
cool by talking and Yeah, I agree.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's not lasting.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's kind of a short that's like
throwing That's not creative, right

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
because there is no skin in the game. So
yeah, I think Well, community efforts can

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
easily help perform that especially in
2025 because well

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Paid marketing did work well. I think, I
don't know, maybe my personal fantasy is

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
just, but it did work well back in 2017,
18, something like that, right? When even

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
some paid slope in coin telegraph, coin
desk. It worked quite well, but these

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
days, I don't know, so we have like
thousands of different blockchain

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
projects, let's say, claiming somewhat
decentralization, but yeah, usually having

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
concentrated distribution and so
possibility to throw printed money.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,000
basically right on paid marketing but
then yeah I mean it's just Totally

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:32,000
tasteless flow of low quality content
basically, right? So it doesn't make sense

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
to read cryptocurrency media in 2025,
right? Because of that, you just can check

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
buzzwords density in headlines just to...
well get the idea what's popular now and

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
that's it so yeah well I think community
marketing can do much better just because

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:08,000
of skin in the game and yeah it's more
creative by nature right

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, yeah, I'd say so. I think what I
was trying to say is, while community

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
marketing and grassroots marketing is
difficult compared to throwing $1,000,

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
$2,000, $5,000, $100,000 at a marketing
firm, it is definitely more sustainable.

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's harder to kickstart that right off
the bat, whereas the big marketing firms

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
are, you just throw money at it, you're
done. But those are not sustaining. Burn

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
bright for a second catch some fireflies
even burn the fireflies with your project

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and then go away, you know, so community
marketing I think it's for sure the way to

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
go and what Ergo has been doing forever
now people that believe in the project

50
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
come in do their part pitch in and It
spreads naturally. So yeah.

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah hundred percent Well, let's jump
right to let's get over the couple dev

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
updates that you have today And then we
can go into more talking more about

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
marketing after that sound good

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
All right, no objections. Here we go.
Let's see if this works.

55
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The main thing is 6.0 got activated.
Check your notes if you are running. So

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
both 6.0 and 5.0 should be in agreement.
So I'm running a few notes of both

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
versions and yes everything seems fine. So
yeah it's working as expected and yeah now

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
we have a new parameter which is workable
by miners. So number of sub-blocks per

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
block to be used In upcoming sub-blocks
protocol protocol Right.

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And so yeah, currently i'm working on
sub-blocks white paper What's that take to

61
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
what's that take to change how many votes
how many what percentage does that take to

62
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
change the number of sub-blocks?

63
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So just 50 so it's pretty much like block
size so block cost limits, right? So it's

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
just like ordinary parameter so you can
change a little bit so by one maybe even

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
right so if it's 30 sub-blocks per block
on average this epoch and miners are

66
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
wanting to raise it then next epoch it
would be 31 right and then 32 so yeah it's

67
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
pretty much like block size or block cost
limits.

68
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But yeah it's relative so one percent and
here it's absolute if my memory serves me

69
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,000
well yeah so it's absolute one sub-block
you can change so up or down so it could

70
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
be 29 or 31 next epoch going from 30.

71
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Cool. Cool. It looks like you got Sigma
SDK examples recently done. You want to

72
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
talk about that and GitCircles as well?

73
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah. So, but basically it's what was
discussed one or two weeks ago. So, well,

74
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
as we have kind of treasury of different
designs, ideas, and so on, expressed on

75
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
the Ergo form back in 2019. 2020. So now
I'm basically using AI agents to generate

76
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
codes right along with tests. So sometimes
it's like pure garbage. So AI is

77
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
generating just some nonsense especially
when it comes to cryptography. But yeah

78
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
when it's possible to generate something
useful so I'm rechecking contracts.

79
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Manually, then yeah I'm publishing and
sometimes it's working well so then yeah

80
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm publishing and well I'm also checking
that tests generated are actually testing

81
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
useful for testing and testing real
properties of contracts and that contracts

82
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
are not flawed at least trivially so

83
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah, then they would be useful, right?
So there are a few examples already

84
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
published, such as whitelist transfers,
right? So global transfer policy example,

85
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
made in Pure ErgoScript. So in a sidechain
implementation, could be more efficient,

86
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
like in proposed braid design, but it's
possible even with ErgoScript, and the

87
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
example is now published. Then Stealth
Address, which is already used in some

88
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
wallets, such as Desktop ErgoMixer,
probably the only one, not sure if

89
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Minotaur or any other wallet. is using it
but yeah now there is also contract

90
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
published along with tests. Then wallet
with daily withdrawal limit which could be

91
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
quite cool for cold wallet implementation
right if you for example having

92
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
centralized exchange then yeah you can put
funds in this kind of

93
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
a contract-protected cold wallet and then
have max spending at like 1% a day, for

94
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
example. So yeah, it could be quite useful
for centralized exchanges to use such

95
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
techniques in a transparent way instead of
what they are doing Perpetual token is a

96
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
token which can be earned. I don't know
how useful this idea is these days, but

97
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
back in 2020 there were some applications
which had need for this perpetual token

98
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
pattern.

99
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You can use a combination of those
things, so you can combine Cold wallets

100
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
with withdrawal limits, I don't know, with
maybe even white listed transfers, right?

101
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So you can have cold wallets with only
white listed exit options and so on. So

102
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
yeah, those contracts can be considered as
building blocks also, right? So more

103
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
complex. financial machinery.

104
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Then GitCircles, maybe the guys will
starting to provide updates by their own

105
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
soon, but currently there is just some
small telegram group and I'm taking

106
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
updates from that. So yeah, well, we wish
you balance is now working on the website.

107
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
started today even and, yeah, he made the
last issue before deployment and, well,

108
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Brough Etiquette is working on
implementation of state issues towards

109
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
deployment and testing. So after this
issue number 11, so the plan is to start

110
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
onboard different developing communities.
maybe for dependencies heavily used in the

111
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Ergo ecosystem, such as Rust libraries and
so on. And yeah, that would be quite an

112
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
interesting experiment to onboard
different developers, developing

113
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
communities on Ergo.

114
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Alright, then I made some progress with
basis Chain Cash. Some actions like

115
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:45,000
issuing debt nodes, working, but other
things are buggy, so I'm polishing things

116
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:55,000
now. Another developer started to work on
wallets, so soon probably we may show some

117
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:05,000
prototype transfers.

118
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Did you say that Chain Cash is going to
need some agents running, I mean some

119
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
batchers running, or is that just
interacts fully with smart contracts on

120
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Chain, no need for any batching machines
running?

121
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So for Chain Cash, it's fully on chain.
But yeah, currently we are working on

122
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
basis, which is off chain cache, right?
Using some trackers. Yeah, you need to use

123
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
some Parties which track state of debt
nodes issued off chain, right? But Yeah,

124
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
it's open source solution. So it's kind of
like a BitTorrent, right, so you may

125
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
connect to different trackers, right, you
may choose tracker freely, you can run a

126
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,000
tracker and yeah, to trust in them can be
minimized, so it can be federation like

127
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Oracle Pool or Rosen Bridge, right, so it
can be maybe done as an

128
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
something like Rollup maybe even but yeah
it's still quite an early idea to be

129
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
researched further. So yeah a lot of
options to reduce trust there but we are

130
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
starting with the simplest option right so
the idea currently is to show well working

131
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
financial systems where Money can be
created using a combination of trust and

132
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
blockchain assets. So the same idea as
Chain Cash. And yeah, so there is also

133
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
updates maybe not published even towards
USE stable coins. Well, I've published the

134
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
proposed parameters in the Telegram group
today and we are discussing them. So the

135
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Oracle pool is running smoothly, the new
USD Oracle pool. So yeah, there is a

136
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
chance to see

137
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:29,000
deployments of the new stable coin quite
quickly. Let's see, so it's not well about

138
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:38,000
technical issues at this point mostly, but
yeah, rather discussions, politics, all

139
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:47,000
that stuff. And once done, yeah, so we
will have a new USD stable coin and the

140
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:56,000
idea of reaching and other whales around
is to use it for bringing efficient

141
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:05,000
unstoppable algorithmic stable coin
liquidity towards other ecosystems, such

142
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:14,000
as Binance Smart Chain, Cardano and so on.

143
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But yeah, also we can use those things in
combination, right? So once you have

144
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
algorithmic unstoppable dollar, you can
use it in basis, right? So for off-chain

145
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
payments for local trading, AI to AI
payments and so on.

146
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Kushti, what's it going to take to get
the current Oracle updated to the new one?

147
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Just a little priority kind of thing at
the moment?

148
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah, so I think, well, so the plan is to
update the bank, right, towards using the

149
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
new Oracle, but they're compatible, so
it's just about ID to be updated. But then

150
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
there are some different parameters, such
as, yeah, we are doing some delay in the

151
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Oracle version 1, right? And yeah, it's
also about, yeah, epoch is the same. But

152
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
yeah, there is delay.

153
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Do you have a first time decision coming
up in a year or was that already done?

154
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
No, not quite. But by the way, for new
applications, yeah, it's better to use new

155
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
oracles, new application touches, Sigma
lock. So I haven't heard about Sigma lock

156
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
for a while.

157
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Maybe I'll have to, I think they're
waiting. I think they wrote me last week

158
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
to set up the infrastructure for it, which
yeah. So it's probably on me at this

159
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
point. So yeah, hopefully soon.

160
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Cool. All right. All right. We got one
more update that snuck in after last

161
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
week's update that I want to talk about
too. Cyberverse update report. Cyber

162
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Citizen NFTs generate CYPX rewards in the
bank. That's cool. Multiplayer combat's a

163
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
big thing they're working on. The first
build has been tested. Two players run,

164
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
move, dash, attack in real time. Early
Foundation but already feels alive. Sets

165
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
the stage for larger battles. Environment
Siberia city gets animated trees and

166
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
plants. Oh, wow. Awesome Really gonna push
the video card there adds life in motion

167
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
to the world environment is improving with
each update I wonder if this will play for

168
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
you guys.

169
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Let's see Will it play? It will not play
for some reason. I think it's my OBS

170
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
choking out. So very cool. Very cool.
Well, short update. So let's go on to the,

171
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,000
we were hearing some things about
marketing approaches and we just got a new

172
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
member to join hopefully the Ergo Twitter.
And I'm wondering if Aberg can chat about

173
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,000
his approach to community marketing.

174
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Hey. Hey, everyone. Hi. Welcome. Thank
you. Thank you. So we started with the

175
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Raiders group on Telegram. And we're
growing, I would say, reasonably fast.

176
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,000
We've got 20 members now. So just for
starting, that's pretty decent. I'm going

177
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
to create a Google Drive link, which is
going to be public, where we can upload

178
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
promotional content for Ergo. And anyone
can use it. We can post it in the Ergo

179
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
group chat on Telegram and Discord. Also
on the Raiders group on Twitter.

180
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Can you mind explaining what Raiders is
to people who might not know?

181
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Great, sure. So the Raiders group is a
telegram group where we can post a link

182
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and we can set targets for how many likes
we want to achieve, reposts, and replies.

183
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And the raid is basically where you could
click the link in the telegram group,

184
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:31,000
you'd like it, and it would go on for 15
minutes. So we can set targets, track the

185
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:39,000
targets and try to get more exposure on
Twitter. So it's specifically for X.

186
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And then I'm going to work on simplifying
some content for non-technical people as

187
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
well, such as myself. And I'm going to be
posting that onto the Google Drive link.

188
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And then we can also get some stuff done
for technical people to onboard some more

189
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
developers to the Ergo ecosystem as well.

190
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So you could, you could technically work
hand in hand with the main Ergo platform

191
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
account, post things to that raid, that
kind of thing. Is that how, is that how

192
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
that would work together?

193
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Yes, so any admin on Telegram, on the
Raiders group, I think I've made you an

194
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
admin as well, can post a link to any
tweets. So we don't want to promote trash

195
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
tweets. We want to promote good tweets. So
that's why the admins can only post the

196
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
links. And then you can set targets.
Everyone will get a notification. It will

197
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
update every time someone likes. OK, let's
say we set 15 likes. We've achieved 10. So

198
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
it will say 10 likes, 11 likes, 10
retweets, so on and so on and so on until

199
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
that raid is either achieved or it's past
the time limit. It's got to the time limit

200
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
of 15 minutes and then the raid ends.

201
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Very cool. Anyway, this can work hand in
hand or somehow work together with Erg1?

202
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah, of course.

203
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Of course. We could promote any tweet in
the Raiders group in the algorithm system.

204
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Nice. So in general, it's a group of
community members that, by joining the

205
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
group, have volunteered to participate in
raids when they're present and do those

206
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
actions of the raids when they're active
kind of thing.

207
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yeah.

208
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Cool. Okay.

209
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah, and it gives notifications all the
time. So they'll get notifications on

210
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
their phone and updates on how many likes
it's achieved. So it's consistently

211
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
pinging all the community members.

212
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Oh, very cool.

213
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Oh, that's nice. So yeah, let me put a
promotion of this group into more groups

214
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:23,000
around, including national ones. So we
have actually quite active National

215
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:33,000
groups, especially Russian, Indonesian.
Indonesian folks in particular are quite

216
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:43,000
active in marketing, right? Uleos, Qi, so
they're doing a lot. Uleos is bombing

217
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:53,000
CoinGecko all the time and so on, doing
translations. So yeah, it would be good to

218
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:03,000
get people. on promoting. I think from 20
we need to get to 200.

219
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What I find is that sometimes the most
effective thing, at least for Twitter, is

220
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
it's the initial hit right after the post.
From the things that we've seen go big, if

221
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
we have an initial hit of quite a few
people, that seems to get it in front of

222
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
more people's eyes and then it multiplies
beyond that kind of thing. The ones that

223
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
are slow burn, they just continue to slow
burn as they go. But like the big ones, we

224
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
get a couple hundred likes right out of
the gate within, within like 20, 30

225
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
minutes. It usually goes pretty big after
that. So, so this can be, you know, really

226
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
big to help out those kinds of things.
This is great.

227
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Awesome. Does this come with leaderboards
or anything like that, Aberg? Or is this

228
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
just, this is just community kind of stuff
with no leaderboards?

229
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Yeah, there's no leaderboards.

230
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Good, I hate leaderboards, but somebody
might like it.

231
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Maybe I could find a way to keep track,
to somehow, I don't know, reward the most

232
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
active members. That would be nicer. Let
me try looking to that.

233
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Gotcha, cool, cool, cool. I think we can,
you can probably, if you have something

234
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
reporting back to Telegram, then a bot
could read that and then keep track of

235
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
stuff perhaps. Otherwise, I think you're
pretty limited on the API access to

236
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Twitter from what I remember. I think they
nuked it right when Elon took over. Yeah.

237
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm not sure. Yeah. Cool. That's awesome.
Look forward to it. Yeah. I mean, that's,

238
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
that's kind of an easy thing, right?
You're sitting there with your phone and

239
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
you get a ping on telegram that a raid
started and you just click a button and

240
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
hit like and retweet and you're done or
quote tweet. So. I think it's a pretty

241
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
effortless thing to do there. Yeah, and
Grayman's saying, don't forget Erg-1. And

242
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I think, Grayman, I think this sounds like
it has an opportunity to work with Erg-1,

243
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
right? So if you're doing Erg-1 and you
want to retweet one of your Erg-1 tweets,

244
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
you can bring it right in and do a raid on
it kind of thing.

245
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Yeah, neat. Should I let should I let
iPhone into the into the chat from the

246
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
waiting room? I'm a little a little gun
shy from the last couple zoom bombs.

247
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Can the guy be muted just and then
present in text chat for status?

248
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I can force let me let me change the
settings here that people enter mute. Yeah

249
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Okay, yeah, he's muted. Yep. Okay. Good.

250
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yeah, then we need for proof of telegram
accounts. So basically, the telegram or

251
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Twitter.

252
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Yeah, there he goes. That's funny. I'm
glad I muted him. And he's changing his

253
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
name. That's funny. Hang on one sec, let
me get him. Okay, he's done. It's really

254
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
funny. Good thing I, what's it called? I
brought him in muted. Did he make you his

255
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
stuff? Oh, that's funny. Wow, in there.
These people are creative. Somebody really

256
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
hates us, I guess.

257
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Actually, yeah, that's funny. So, I mean,
some guys, yeah, actually quite nice. So

258
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:39,000
there are lots of trolls in chats. Yeah,
they're actually quite helping because

259
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Yeah, well, because of them, now, well, we
are providing some instructions, right?

260
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Like how to find truth, basically, right?
How to do own research without having

261
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:03,000
trust. And that's actually quite awesome
because, well, it's about absence of

262
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:11,000
trust, right? It should be. So then, yeah,
well, trials, which are, trying to, feed,

263
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:19,000
feed lies, is basically a reminder of
that. Yeah. There, there should be no

264
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:27,000
trust, right? Right. Right. Yeah. Exactly.
So yeah.

265
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
No, I think we've got a good setup here
right now for for at least verifying

266
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
people coming into the thing so the worst
that he just did is he spammed our chat

267
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
inside here that nobody can see and called
us some pretty bad names and then did some

268
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
emojis to try to lock up the screen and
then he apparently is running a script too

269
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
that changes his name to sweep him up and
down the participants list, but

270
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I guess that doesn't work on mine because
I was able to pin him easily and get rid

271
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
of him So for sure an idiot, but what can
you do, you know? Hey Great. All right.

272
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Well, that's always fun to try to
circumvent that every every week challenge

273
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
accepted, buddy But yeah, like I, like
Kushti was saying, I think these help,

274
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
these kinds of things help develop systems
of trust, right? Of somewhat trust of

275
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
initially having to prove yourself. So
right now the chats are muted and people

276
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
have to come in and, and actually, you
know, engage and then they'll be elevated

277
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
to able to unmute and chat kind of thing.

278
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah. So neat. All right. What else is
new guys? We got the, we've got the, Event

279
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
in Colorado coming up. It sounds like
there's going to be a bunch of beer there

280
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
after lunch. So when you guys are
listening to the chats, whether you're at

281
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
home listening to the stream or you're in
person in sunny Colorado Springs, there'll

282
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
be a wide selection of local brews for you
guys to sip from, courtesy of the

283
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Sigmanauts. So that'll be fun.

284
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
as well as the speaker list. Let me go
through the speaker list again. Hang on

285
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
guys, I'll let you, I'll allow you guys to
unmute. All right, you guys in the chat

286
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
can now unmute if you want to chat. So the
list right now is, and let me get to it.

287
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Okay, so we have 9 a.m. come for coffee
and tea donuts provided by the SIGS. Joe's

288
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
going to pick him up. He knows a special
donut shop, so that'll be good. 945,

289
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
you're going to hear a welcome from the
one, the only Joseph Armeanio. So that

290
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
starts at 945. I gave him 15 minutes, but
we all know Joe. This could probably take

291
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
five hours. This might take the whole day,
actually, if we can't stop him. So we've

292
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
got to stop him after 15 minutes. And then
after that, our first speaker is LGD, also

293
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
known as MGPi. He is going to talk about
gluon theorems and maybe a little bit

294
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
about his staking that he custom wrote,
but gluon. 11 a.m., I think that's

295
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
probably, I know it's before noon, but
that's when people break off to grab their

296
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
lunches and bring them back. And we'll
have the beer open by then and alcohol.

297
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And that's when Perfect Timing 1130 Cheese
starts talking about Lithos Protocol Deep

298
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Dive. After that, you can refill your
beers and there'll be a small break. And

299
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
that's when Cannon comes and talks about
something really cool that he wants to

300
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
show the community. I'm looking forward to
that chat too. I'm looking forward to all

301
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
the chats. It's going to be great. After
that, there's going to be a small mining

302
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
workshop with Mark that's going to be
streamed as well. All this is going to be

303
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
streamed. And then our final speaker of
the day is Ann on BR. That's Allison. And

304
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
they're going to talk about Machina
Finance, which is going to be in maybe

305
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
something else. Maybe there might be a
secret thing that he's going to talk

306
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
about. So you got to stay tuned. Depends
if Joe can convince him. And then 3 p.m.

307
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
There's going to be a live roundtable AMA,
depending on how everybody feels, if

308
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
they're not too saturated with the beer
and they're not going to make sillies of

309
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
themselves. Live table AMA, we'll stream
in as well. Everybody can chat about the

310
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
day as well as the future of Ergo holds,
that kind of stuff, whatever you fancy.

311
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And then we break off and go help Chris
shop and Chris is going to make everybody

312
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Korean barbecue. At dinner right at the
facility. So that's gonna be good. I

313
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
really hope there's enough beer. I think
there will be There's a big budget for

314
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
that. So everybody should have a good time
with that at least Looking forward to that

315
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
CannonQ Grayman. You guys are going right?

316
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Oh We're unmuted. Yes.

317
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Okay. Yeah, you guys can unmute now.
Yeah, I I'll be there. Very nice. I'm

318
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
looking forward to your talk, CannonQ. It
should be interesting.

319
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Yeah, it will be. For sure will be. I
will be here. You're going to be that

320
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
fantastic, Grayman. But this is the first
of many, I think. It always has to start

321
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
somewhere, and these kind of meetups are
great. I was talking to CannonQ and Joe

322
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Armeanio yesterday night, and I was
thinking that maybe next year I could host

323
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
it up here in New York.

324
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
stuff's fairly cheap around here hotels
that kind of thing and it's beautiful

325
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
during certain times of the year and we
can try to integrate some sort of cause

326
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Cornell blockchain thing inside it as well
and and host it on campus hopefully if we

327
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
can start a group like that so so there's
a lot of potential for that as well to

328
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
gather more people as well interested in
that kind of thing so yeah looking really

329
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
forward to the beginnings of this kind of
stuff and continuing the tradition

330
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Moving on year after year What one quick
programming note LGD is Luca So I think

331
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,000
he's doing gluon and I think MG pie is
talking about something about Palm Staking

332
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:36,000
or something like that or Machina maybe

333
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Right, right, sorry, I read them as one,
didn't I? Yeah, Luca and MGPi, they're

334
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
dual-talking. I forgot about that, right.
Yep, so I think... Did we get the location

335
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
of the venue? Yes, sir.

336
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I was laughing at you because in the
first draft of all that stuff, It had all

337
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
these details and there was no location
for the venue. She's like, what is wrong

338
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
with you guys?

339
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It's on the blockchain, sir. It's in the
meetup chat. Go to the meetup chat,

340
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Grayman. It's right there posted. There's
a link to a website for the venue. It's

341
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Colorado Springs. You just show up and ask
somebody. I'm sure they'll tell you where

342
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
it is. Just yell very loudly. Joe will
hear you.

343
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Ask the homeless people?

344
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
The unhomed, sir. I haven't offended.

345
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Awesome. All right, what else, guys?
We've got a couple minutes left.

346
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I applied to get Kushti a H1B.

347
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I know, right? Somebody hire Kushti.

348
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
We're going to get that handled here,
guys.

349
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Let's get 100 grand. We'll get Kushti an
H1B visa, and we'll get him here for the

350
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
event. Anybody got 100 grand?

351
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Oh, but yeah, well, I need to spend some
time also, so it's not that. Easy. So

352
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,000
yeah, let's see. Maybe next time. But we
discussed actually also maybe something

353
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,000
around Anarkapulko in February. So it, it
will be, late, late probably February,

354
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,000
2026.

355
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
What's the weather there then? Is it
nice?

356
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
What's the location? So it's the Acapulco
of Mexico. Oh, and, yeah, it should be

357
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
nice.

358
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Hell yeah.

359
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I can hear the tequila agreement.

360
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm looking up the weather right now
there in February. It says it is, on

361
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
average, 86 to 74 degrees Fahrenheit. I
don't know what that is in non-freedom

362
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
units. Somebody can do the calculation for
me. That's pretty nice. That's great.

363
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Sounds like a good temperature. We have
venues down there. We got connections.

364
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Kushti?

365
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Let me check. So, Yeah, well, our friends
Lutz and so on, so they proposed a booth a

366
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:14,000
few years ago. I don't know what they're
doing this year. So yeah, let's think with

367
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:22,000
them. So it will be an AnarkoPulko
conference. organized by Vigilante group

368
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and others. So, yeah, let's see, let's
see. And yeah, Vigilante also, yeah, so

369
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:38,000
they know Ergo, so they've written
something back in 2021. So it would be

370
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:46,000
good to get in touch again.

371
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Talking about marketing, I think it's
quite easy to sell Ergo to Bitcoin OGs. At

372
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:09,000
least Bitcoin OGs, I know personally.
They're quite fond of, especially

373
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:18,000
recently, when I started to describe all
the ideas around Chain Cash and so on. How

374
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:27,000
can we realistically separate money from
the state? That's the very original idea

375
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:36,000
of Bitcoin. Yeah, well, it's a resume with
Bitcoin OG mentality. So yeah, we need to

376
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:45,000
do this for more. Definitely.

377
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You've had success with that, you think,
Kushti? Sorry, you've had success with

378
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
diehard Bitcoin OGs?

379
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Yeah, I know personally Wow, I mean so
public Bitcoiners OG Maybe not so OG even

380
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
probably quite different, right? So
they're playing maximalism all that stuff

381
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
But I know so when you talk with some real
OGs in person, yeah, that's that's quite

382
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
different experience actually I mean,
well, anyway, if you are not buying

383
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
separating money from states, then yeah,
well, you are not quite a Bitcoin OG,

384
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,000
right?

385
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
True, true. Nice. All right, well we got
10 minutes left unless you guys have

386
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
something to say we can wrap it up and
save some more stuff for the AMA the the

387
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
extra AMA on Saturday afternoon Where
everybody's half sloshed would be nice and

388
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
loose

389
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'm going to say I would love to see
Kushti and Joe on that Vlad podcast, the

390
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Bitcoin podcast. Like I would love to see
that because he has long like detailed,

391
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
like they go through the technicals. I was
actually impressed by some of the things

392
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
by Casper because I never really dove into
their project until I saw the clip of what

393
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
he said about Kushti. So I thought, OK, a
little more interesting than I thought.

394
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
All right, so Vlad's podcast, right? So
yeah, Vlad is there. So yeah, he's

395
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
following me after that Casper episode. So
yeah, let's try to reach the guy. Yeah,

396
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
well, we also need to organize finally an
episode with Mark right from Kraken,

397
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Kraken now.

398
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Yeah, the schedules just need to align.
That's all I think I think the balls in

399
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
his let me check the Twitter I think the
balls in his court right now or it's in

400
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
our court. Hang on No, it's not every day
The balls in our court Kushti, he said I

401
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
think we were trying to decide if you're
gonna go to 2049 or not Marks at 2049

402
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
token 2040. Wait, that's over. Isn't it?
When's token 2049 Kushti

403
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's over. Yeah.

404
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah. All right. So let's think of a new
time. Kushti, just DM me your schedule.

405
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Oh, so I'm flexible. Yeah. So this month
I'm flexible till 26. Yeah.

406
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Okay. Just give me your time ranges. I'll
send it to him and we'll facilitate

407
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
something.

408
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
All right. All right. So yeah, that's
all.

409
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Yeah. That'll probably just be you and
Mark. I don't think Joe can, Meeting with

410
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
somebody that works in an exchange is not
a good recipe for Joe's behavior, the

411
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
meaner to stay settled. So Joe is opting
out of that conversation. So it'll mostly

412
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
just be Kushti and Mark. Maybe I'll
facilitate, perhaps, but we'll see. So

413
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
yeah, that'll be great. Yep. All right,
everybody. That's great.

414
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Thanks for joining. Maybe a CannonQ. We
have a lot of webinars. We do? Yeah. We

415
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
need to have more voices.

416
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Let's have a roundtable with that. That's
fine. So anybody that's interested, please

417
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
pop in your interest in a DM or something,
and we'll keep track of it. And then we'll

418
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
invite you all to that talk if you're
interested in having a conversation like

419
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
that. Fantastic. Yep. Great. All right. We
will see everybody and the stream at least

420
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
at the AMA if you're not in person or the
whole day I mean with streaming the talks

421
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Bring a glass. I don't have a glass and
Sip away while you enjoy the events of the

422
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
day folks Great. All right

423
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Thanks everybody set up a yeah, we set up
a telegram group We probably could have

424
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
glass link it on somewhere on discord as
well So people will ask questions or you

425
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
know, if they have feedback during the
presentations Right, right. That's a good

426
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
that'll be a good place to do that.

427
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Yeah, great I'll try to monitor those
during the presentations if people have

428
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
questions, you know remotely. Yep.

429
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Awesome. So yeah, the presentations will
go for maybe 30, 35, 40 minutes, and then

430
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
there'll be time for questions afterwards
from either the Zoom audience or the

431
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
in-person group. So yeah, of course.
Great. Who wants to close it out today?

432
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Kushti, Byron?

433
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Sorry? Who wants to close it out today?
We got to switch around, Rob, in closings.

434
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But maybe anyone has thoughts on
marketing, like proposals and so on?

435
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Because, yeah, I mean, there are a lot of
talks that more marketing is needed, but,

436
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
yeah, well, what's... Yeah, usually those
are... What's doable? What can someone

437
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
propose?

438
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Yeah, Kushti, it's easier to shout into
the wind than walk into the wind, you

439
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
know. So I find until somebody starts
walking into it like Aberg is, then

440
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
there's not much you can do, right? Except
for invite them to walk towards you into

441
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
it and actually do something. So I'm so
happy that Aberg is taking those reins and

442
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
doing it and going to work on Twitter as
well.

443
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yeah, but on this call, I believe we have
active people, right? So not just talking

444
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:30,000
for years, the chats without doing
anything.

445
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Marketing is all about assessing the
market. Who are you talking to? And

446
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
CannonQ was sort of orchestrating some
pretty good work in that direction, but

447
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
really focused on miners. Which I think is
interesting, however, GPU mining is ever

448
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
since the merge in Ethereum has kind of
fallen off. But it's an interesting pool

449
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
of people that you could potentially draw
in because, I mean, what other coins are

450
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
strong in GPU mining? There's Ravencoin
and whatnot, Progpow, whatever. But I

451
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
think Ergo is pretty near the top. So
that's a pretty good place to go and look

452
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
for people. But if you're going to reach
out in general on X or Twitter, then

453
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
you're talking to the whole world. And the
question is, who does it get spread to?

454
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
You've got to really narrow your message
or have multiple messages and use

455
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
different venues for those or different
approaches, maybe different people.

456
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Yeah, I totally agree, Grayman. In
regards to multiple messages, we could try

457
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,000
target developers, miners, non-technical
people. I think a progressive approach is

458
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:56,000
to set some KPIs for myself, for example,
and post x amount per day and try to meet

459
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:03,000
them KPIs regardless and stay consistent.
Because I'm sure you know how the

460
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:10,000
algorithm works, the more consistent you
are, the more exposure you'll get. And it

461
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,000
only takes one or two accounts to really
recognize the tech and the community

462
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:24,000
behind Ergo. So I think a progressive
approach will be KPIs and consistently

463
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:31,000
push content out there. and we can create
some memes, not meme tokens of course, but

464
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:38,000
some funny old school memes about Ergo,
some kind of controversial tweets, we'll

465
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:45,000
get it approved before putting it out
there, as well as pushing for the vision

466
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,000
and our values and what we actually stand
for.

467
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Sounds good to me. But yeah, it feels
like X is unfortunately, you know, it's

468
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
hard to break out of the bubble of crypto
Twitter and get into the other places in

469
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
the in the glory days of Twitter before
Elon bought it. It was, I mean, there were

470
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
so many different communities. I don't
really see a whole lot of that on my feed

471
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
ever since I switched to be, you know, I
guess I get primarily crypto people now.

472
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
So I don't really have a feel for it, but
maybe a different venue. QX was talking

473
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
about Facebook, I think. Byron. I am not
on Facebook and I will never be on it, but

474
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
that's another way to go. But I really
feel like the other thing that we're kind

475
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
of missing long run is trying to reach out
in the academic world, not just towards

476
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
students, but that would be a good way to
go.

477
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,000
but also towards researchers and in other
fields like economics and what have you.

478
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
We have some contacts already. Well, I
mean, one of them is right here. He

479
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,000
actually works at Cornell. We have people
who, like for example, Shai, I think he's

480
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,000
some professor at Harvard. We already have
some contacts in that realm, but it would

481
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,000
be good to expand it. Just because even
though that doesn't lead to an enormous

482
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:30,000
amount of people coming in, it leads to a
very high quality of person coming in and

483
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,000
then from there you can leverage that to
go get the more people.

484
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I think that's a great idea, Grayman.
Could we do, because I know Scala has

485
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
conferences, could we do booths at Scala
conferences? Because I'm not sure if

486
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
there's other projects with Scala, like
syntax or code, unless I'm mistaken. Could

487
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
ERG do something like that, like physical
conferences, like do booths and things

488
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
like that?

489
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Yeah, we can try. So Scala and Rust
maybe. So Rust community is super active

490
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:17,000
now in regards with contributions to open
source. So yeah, may make sense to reach

491
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:24,000
all the circles. So developers in Scala
and Rust and yeah, academics. So initially

492
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Ergo was well, quite well known right in
certain circles but yeah but back then I

493
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,000
think cryptocurrency research was more
foundational and probably more profound as

494
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:45,000
well so yeah well make sense to

495
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:59,000
to get more recognition there. Probably,
well, upcoming stable coin workshop

496
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:08,000
organized by Bruno will be helpful, right?
And then, yeah, let's think for more.

497
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I'm still a really firm believer in that
people are lazy, right? And I see this all

498
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
the time at school, right? These kids who
There may be an event or workshop or

499
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
something that literally will help what
they do tenfold, right? Or literally is

500
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
exactly what they're interested in, what
they're doing, but they don't go and it's

501
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
not well attended. And you're like, what
the hell? And I think the same thing

502
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
happens with marketing, that kind of
thing, right? It's really hard to get

503
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
people involved, especially even more so
hard because they're not even using your

504
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
product, right? So I'm always a firm
believer as well as marketing and

505
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
grassroots outreach as just making a
gosh-darn product and getting them on

506
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
board kind of thing. Getting them using it
because at least they're using it at that

507
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
point and maybe they'll come to a
conference because they like it or want to

508
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
make it better or whatnot. But yeah, I
find that stuff tough at least outside of

509
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
the blockchain circle to get people
interested in stuff that they're already

510
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
interested in and actually using even.
Just my two cents.

511
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Yeah, and hopefully with GitCircles and
other tooling for real-world needs of open

512
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:35,000
source developers, hopefully, yeah, it
would be a viral, right? And hopefully,

513
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:44,000
yeah, that's how we would get more
developers around. All right, let's see.

514
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:53,000
So hopefully, yeah, in like a few weeks,
yeah, well, promotion of GitCircles can be

515
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:02,000
started. Well, initially with just a few
communities to be onboard, but then more.

516
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Great. Aberg, I'm going to give you some
delegate access later today. After I look

517
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
at your profile, make sure you're not a
crazy. And we'll see some new posts on the

518
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
main Ergo Twitter. That'll be great,
combined with the Twitter raids. And maybe

519
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
we can get Ergo One involved as well to
have them promote to send stuff to us as

520
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
well, so we can help pump them to their
project. So yeah, awesome. Why don't we

521
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
let Byron close it today? Byron, any words
of wise?

522
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Bloody hell. Everyone be safe this
weekend. Tune into the stream. Let's have

523
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
some fun.

524
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Thanks everybody. Have a great day. Ciao
ciao.

525
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Thank you, Byron. Thank you, everyone.
Bye.
