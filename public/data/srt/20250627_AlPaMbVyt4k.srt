00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is Timer here and welcome to my Ergo
Hacks submission, the Sigma Quest.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is like my very first project. I had
a lot of help from some friends. And so I

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
just want to say thanks, Mark the Shark.
CA, thanks for helping out. Also thanks to

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Claude, if Claude is listening.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Cursor, I vibe coded the heck out of
this. This is really like my first project

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
where I coded anything. And there's like a
minimal amount of me getting in there and

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
kind of figuring out patterns and figuring
out what patterns was broken.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But I still am not a developer and so
this may be simple and sloppy compared to

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
a lot of other stuff, but I'm proud of it
and I hope you all have fun playing my

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
game.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Alright, so first of all, yeah, thanks
everybody who contributed to our honeypot

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
here. I'm going to bump this up to about
200 ERG before it gets going and yeah, so

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
the first person to complete the game is
going to win access to that wallet.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So let me just walk you through a little
bit. Let me show off the vault first. So I

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
coded this up and it reads that honeypot
wallet and displays an accurate depiction

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
of all the coins in the wallet. And if you
win this game, all you have to do is write

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
down all the seed words that you get along
the way and then you can restore that

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
wallet in Nautilus and all these coins
will be yours.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I have a quick little guide for folks who
might be new, how to get your Nautilus

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
wallet and how to play the game. The game
is going to cost 10 ERG to play per game.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There's three games. So with perfect play,
you'll do it in about 30 ERG and you'll

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
take home at least 200. And yeah.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Each of these games is quite different.
I'll kind of walk through them a little

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
bit. I don't want to give away a whole
lot. But yeah, let's check them out.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So here is my game page. And you can see
that there's three games. This first game,

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and I'm not going to show the title even
because it's going to kind of give away

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the concept and people can think about it,
but in this one, there's some logic and

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
the AI, and you're pretty much talking to
the AI and trying to understand the

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
password to get out of your cryopod.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So you're stuck in a cryopod trying to
get out and it'll tell you if you get it

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
right or wrong. And so it's you versus the
AI here. And the goal for the user would

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
be to send a message that has all five
seed words in it in the correct order. And

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
then your character will be released from
the cryopod. And it'll confirm that you

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
have the first five seed words.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And the second game here. Well, so the
second game, you could play it in any

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
order. But I worked hard to make a nice
little narrative. So do it in order.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Now, the second game is quite different
than the first. This is sort of like

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Oregon Trail, the old text-based game. But
see, Oregon Trail was really deterministic

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and everything was preprogrammed. So I do
have a path that you're trying to follow

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
as you escape this ship.

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So the way it'll work is you first, let's
just do this. You log in, send your ten

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
ERG and the game will start up. Okay. Now
you can read, read the narrative and then

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
you'll get some choices. And depending on
what your choice is, that's like kind of

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
going to be the outcome. And you're trying
to find the correct path out of the ship.

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And so that sounds just like, however, if
you make an incorrect choice anywhere

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
along this path, this is where the AI
comes in.

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So I've kind of designed this to trigger
a prompt to the AI that gives context

48
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
about where you are in the story and
what's around you and what that bad choice

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
was that you just made. And so it'll
invent a way to kill you that fits that

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
narrative.

51
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So every time somebody dies in this, it's
going to call Claude and Claude's gonna

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
come up with some new way for you to die
and it's pretty fantastic actually it

53
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
works great. I was a little skeptical at
first, I didn't know how well it's gonna

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
work, but it's really great really
creative so I encourage you all to try

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
this one out.

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This game is structured differently than
the first one. So you just pay 10 ERG to

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
play this game. And if you die, you have
to pay another 10 ERG. This one, you do 10

58
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
ERG for 10 messages while you're trying to
figure out the password.

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
At the end of this game, you escape the
ship. You'll receive your seed words. And

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
then this final game, this is after you
escape the ship. Obviously, you're in a

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
little spaceship here, a little shuttle.

62
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This one is like a combination of the
first two games, so I think it's really

63
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
cool. It might be the easiest game of the
three, but it's to me the coolest because

64
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
it relies the most on AI.

65
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You've escaped the ship and you're going
to encounter some challenges along the

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
way. And the AI is going to be presenting
you with these challenges. And you don't

67
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
have a structured response like you do in
this one. You just have a chat field. And

68
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
so you're going to enter your solution to
that problem, to each of these problems.

69
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
A lot of times there's not really a right
answer, not like one right answer. The AI

70
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
is gonna be the judge of if you should
succeed or fail through each of those

71
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
challenges. It's pretty consistent. I've
had it give me like, maybe some answers

72
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
that worked most of the time, once or
twice that same answer didn't work in play

73
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
testing, but it's pretty straight. I would
just say like, give it a good answer and

74
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
you'll move forward.

75
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And then there's a final boss here that
is pretty cool. I won't say too much about

76
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
it, but this final boss is actually
inventing new, it's prompting Claude to

77
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
create a new question every time somebody
reaches that level.

78
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And so the final section is going to be
the boss asking you some questions,

79
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
they're going to be hard, but the answer
is going to be the seed words, okay, or

80
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
one of the seed words. And so you'll need
to just respond with one seed word at a

81
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
time, and it'll confirm or kill you
creatively, as I mentioned.

82
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And yeah, if you make it all the way,
you'll have all 15 seed words and you can

83
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
jump back to the vault and claim all these
coins, right? So super fun.

84
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It is going to be a bit of a race. I'm
going to try to advertise this a little

85
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
bit so we can get some people and do just
like one release. And like I said, every

86
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
time somebody plays all three games,
that's 30 ERG. So even if we had 10 people

87
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
try to play the game, that's going to be
like 300 ERG that are getting pushed into

88
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
this. So it could be quite large.

89
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And the games are not that easy. So I
hope it's not that easy. If you all solve

90
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
this in an hour, it's going to hurt my
feelings. But I hope you have fun. Nothing

91
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
else.

92
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So here is my GitHub. I forgot to save
something I was doing here. Here's my

93
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
GitHub. I am not making this public
currently because people would be able to

94
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
just look at the files and see how to win
the game. But as soon as somebody wins my

95
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
pot, then I'm going to do that.

96
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But what I have done here is really tried
to make it so that somebody like me who

97
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
doesn't know anything can look at it. And
I even created this developer overview so

98
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
somebody could take this - I forgot to
scroll up. Somebody could take this, feed

99
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
it to Claude or GPT or whatever, and they
should be able to just solve all the

100
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
problems that they need to implement a
game similar to this.

101
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I mean, I imagine it could be quite
different because I just came up with it

102
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and vibe-coded my way. So you can see
everything from my file construction to

103
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
how I set up APIs and commands that I
gave. I cleaned it up with all my

104
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
sensitive information, but there's even
like all the commands that you would need

105
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
to run this and server commands.

106
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So if you have your server up and
running, that's like, here's like a whole

107
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
menu of things that you can do with the
server. And hopefully that'll help

108
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
somebody who's brand new, just kind of see
what it is and get the concept and build

109
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
something cool on Ergo.

110
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I think it was not as hard as I thought
it was going to be. I'll say that. But it

111
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
was long. It was longer than I thought it
was going to be. I've learned a ton. I've

112
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
probably 10x'ed my knowledge of how to
code and create things and connect to the

113
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
blockchain, submit transactions.

114
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And I'm starting to understand now kind
of everything I don't know a little bit

115
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
more about everything I don't know and I'm
excited to keep going and keep building on

116
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Ergo. So that's my Ergo Hacks submission.
Thanks everybody. I hope you enjoy my game

117
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and best of luck to you.
