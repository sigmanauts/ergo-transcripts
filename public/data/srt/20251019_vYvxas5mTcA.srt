1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If you want.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
All right, welcome everybody.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
All right.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Everybody that came in person, thank you
for coming. It's pretty cool to see a

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
little group of people focused on the same
thing. Ultimately, peer-to-peer networks

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
kind of replicate real life where your
community, people you know, people you

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
exchange with kind of create the basis for
everything in your life, right?

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And that's one of the really interesting
things about decentralized systems, is

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that on one hand you have like technical
parameters, but on the other hand you have

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
a social system. And kind of like any
social system you have various levels of

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
trust, sometimes you could call that
belief. And in the extreme, I would even

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
say it's healthy to have an element of
faith in each other, people in your

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
networks.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now, that is both something that can
offer a lot of benefits. It can allow you

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
entry into a peer-to-peer system, but it's
also something that is an attack vector,

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
right? If you have people that kind of
exploit your trust or your belief or your

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
emotions, that doesn't always end well.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I had a presentation put together to kind
of cover the basis of Ergo itself. And

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
then I was thinking last night, everybody
here anyway, and many people that are

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
probably tuning in already know these
things, right? So what is the point of

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
just repeating I don't know what's
publicly available, and anybody with some

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
time, energy, or desire can easily read.
Now, I know that's somewhat of a skill

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
that's being lost, is the ability to read,
but it's there, right?

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I do think it's fascinating kind of the
events of yesterday, right? So let's just

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
speak to the moment. Yesterday I was out
having some beer and some food with some

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
of the people that showed up completely
oblivious to the workings of kind of the

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
broader crypto ecosystem and you come back
and they're like, oh, there's been a

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
spiral effect of deleveraging and billions
have been removed from the market and

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
what's happening and all these people, I
don't know. Hopefully manage their risk,

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
right?

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
A good starting point is understanding
like risk management and leverage.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Leverage is a powerful tool when it's
needed, right? But it's also risky. It's

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
not without its trade-offs. And I think
that sometimes you have the talking heads

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
in the crypto industry that do not like to
talk about risk. And I think that's a

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
fundamental failure of the cryptocurrency
ecosystem broadly.

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Because ultimately in our world, money is
a control system, right? We live, let's

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
say, within the United States. You have a
group of people on a hill somewhere, they

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
say, right? And they go into a room and
they discuss in private. Okay, publicly

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
they'll say we have two parameters. We
want to have employment at a certain

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
level. We want to have inflation at a
certain level. And those two don't

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
necessarily correlate in terms of how they
move anyway, right?

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But they go into a room in secret and
everybody around the world gathers and

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
watches. Say, what are they going to do
with our money? What is going to be the

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
cost of money? And we sit around and
speculate and sometimes people have fun on

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
polymarket or whatever. And eventually
smoke comes out of the chimney and we say,

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
okay, this is our new updated policy.
forked the network, so to speak, and this

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
is going to be the cost of money.

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And we go through this ritual regularly,
people around the world tune in and watch

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and position and try to kind of front run
whatever that trusted setup is going to

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
be. And then on a higher level we have
this idea of, let's call it the type of

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
cross-chain tariff, where arbitrarily you
have new costs added to the system.

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's, I guess, what was a part of the
madness yesterday, more or less.

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's see. Where suddenly, you have these
two economies that interact and we're

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
going to add a hundred percent tariff,
right? And there's no real consensus

55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
mechanism to understand what is coming,
right? It's a trusted system where the

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
individual has very little power. They
have very little power in terms of

57
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
understanding what the assumption is today
and what the assumptions are going to be

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
tomorrow.

59
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And that's not the type of environment
that produces I don't know. The right

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
mindset for risk itself, right? And that's
one of the most interesting things about

61
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
this idea that started with Bitcoin is
saying, okay, can we have a system where

62
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
the parameters are set? Right? Where
monetary policy is more or less set, and

63
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
then build economy on top of set
expectations. And based on how the network

64
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
is set up, within a certain set of
assumptions, you can assume honesty.

65
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's powerful if you look at kind of
the traditional system that we're all born

66
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
into. It's something we just naturally
inherit. It changes depending on where

67
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
you're from, right? But it's kind of more
or less the same. a system where you have

68
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
a high concentration of power and then of
course one of the most profitable things

69
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
is to be close to power, right? Close to
where money is being distributed from and

70
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
generally the further away you get from
that initial distribution point of money

71
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
the more inflation and expansion of money
supply tends to hit, right?

72
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I would say a lot of the crypto industry
has really gotten away from first

73
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
principles. And in my opinion, that's
based on toxic social systems. Because

74
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
that social system is inherent to these
type of networks. Where you constantly

75
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
have people that are saying, trust me,
believe in me, have faith in me. And I

76
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
think that is not the ideal environment to
create the systems that we want to build,

77
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
right?

78
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's a part of why, at least with Ergo,
I've always tried to push for building

79
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
public. that we should ideally have these
primitives in place that are the

80
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
equivalent of public goods. They're open,
they're auditable, and hopefully through

81
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
time and with testing they also become
Extended right they become extendable.

82
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You could look at something within the
Ergo network like SigmaUSD right you have

83
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
first it's based on research right it's
not something that is just willy-nilly

84
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
thrown together which we do see a lot of.
that in the space, right? So as an

85
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
experiment it has a solid foundation,
right? Then you have kind of open code,

86
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
open parameters around that experiment.
that even if the experiment itself

87
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
experiences difficulty, you have the
ability to extend it, adjust it. It's

88
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
open, right? It's open to new ideas. It's
open to new iteration. And ultimately,

89
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
through time, I think we can build solid
public goods with that framework.

90
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And my hope would be that creates its own
flywheel effect. Everybody in crypto these

91
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
days will talk about the flywheel in terms
of financial games. The ideal, in my

92
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
opinion, is to create flywheels with
software. to where you have these public

93
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
goods that can then be reused, right? And
the more diverse these building blocks

94
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
come, you can suddenly cater to a larger
class of functions and applications and

95
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
build something that has a solid
foundation.

96
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Sometimes we get away from this idea of
open code. And I think that type of

97
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
transparency should be a solid base for a
healthy social system because it's based

98
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
in trust, right? Not faith. We are a proof
of work network. And proof of work, one of

99
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
the interesting things is a coordination
mechanism is it's leaderless. It's

100
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
apolitical, right? And that's something
that people often struggle with, like

101
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
grasping in terms of the social system.

102
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
They'll say, hey, Armeanio, you need to
go dance over here. Go do over there.

103
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You're supposed to be a leader. And it's
like, well, I have a certain set of

104
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
skills, right? But meeting everybody that
attended, and I'm sure everybody watching,

105
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
you have a different set of skills. No
different than in the off-chain

106
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
peer-to-peer economy, you bring different
skill sets, different abilities, different

107
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
specialties that you've developed through
time in your life, and you create value

108
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
using those.

109
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't think there should be that much
difference. I'm not universally

110
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
intelligent enough to be the leader of
everything, right? I have my areas where I

111
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
would say I've learned and grown and
developed a certain skill set, but in

112
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
other areas, you do not want me in charge,
right? I'm not the guy. And people

113
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
struggle with that because in social
systems, a lot of the competition is to be

114
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
the guy, right?

115
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Certainly if I have people's trust and
belief in faith and they follow me, I

116
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
guess that's an attack vector that we see
all the time in crypto. And it's funny how

117
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
the sheep are taught their entire life to
fear the wolf. And then in the end, the

118
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
shepherd eats them. Right? having that
basis of how do we create trustlessness,

119
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
not just in software, but also in the
social system itself, that takes

120
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
responsibility. It takes a collective
responsibility, right? We're going to

121
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
build things the right way.

122
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And at least in extended UTXO, there is a
trilemma, let's call it. You have the

123
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
contract itself, you have the off-chain
logic, you have the front end, right? In

124
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
the ideal scenario, all three of those can
be replicated locally. That's what I would

125
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
say makes for a decentralized application.
That's pretty clear parameters, right?

126
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So as an ecosystem, I think it's healthy
to really push for that. That's something

127
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
that I've always tried to promote. And
it's hard to build open code, right?

128
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Because you are in essence being naked in
public. It is sometimes a process to get

129
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
there, right? But I think that is,
Ultimately, a solid goal in terms of

130
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
building public goods.

131
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So we hear about this trilemma in
blockchain all the time. It's a selling

132
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
point. For lack of a better word term,
it's a selling point. But I do think that

133
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
within the Ergo ecosystem anyway, I would
like to promote the idea of our own little

134
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
trilemma, which are those three aspects of
an application. And ideally, if you have

135
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
those three aspects that are open, And you
have tooling that becomes kind of a common

136
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
knowledge base for developers to use and
build off of. You have things in place to

137
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
start creating the right flywheel.

138
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's kind of hard to bootstrap from
nothing, but I think we've done a pretty

139
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
good job as a whole of creating that
mindset and mind share. And there have

140
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
been a lot of developers, some of which
are here, some of which choose to remain

141
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
faceless, which I totally respect, that
have contributed to that type of mindset.

142
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And so everybody that's contributed to
that ideal Public goods. I kind of have to

143
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
tip my hat to you. That's ultimately
powerful when it comes to not just the

144
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
network itself, but also the social system
of the network.

145
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Now, from first principles, crypto should
be about the distribution of power. Proof

146
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
of work kind of represents that in terms
of the distribution mechanism of money

147
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
itself, right? It's something that you can
certainly compete for and build into, but

148
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
having clear assumptions in terms of
distribution of power is needed. And

149
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
sometimes that is buried behind really
good marketing. Sometimes that's buried

150
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
behind social systems. Sometimes it's
buried behind this trust me bro mentality

151
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
that permeates the crypto industry. And I
think that's toxic. And I don't really

152
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
care if people don't like that.

153
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Because if you can't call a spade a
spade, your social system is not going to

154
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
work. That's just honest. I know there's a
lot of financial games and cultural

155
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
movements and things like that. I've said
from day one, for me personally, I would

156
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
rather go to a casino. I know the drinks
are free. That's a solid assumption that I

157
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
can bank on every time. And whatever my
parameters of risk are with the games that

158
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I play, at least I know that assumption is
going to hold.

159
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Now, security is another powerful
mechanism of both the network parameters

160
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and this social layer, because we do need
to address both. Sometimes we see them as

161
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
separate and they're extensions of each
other in terms of what people accept.

162
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Security, at least in our industry, is
something that's formed through time. You

163
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
usually have research as the bedrock of
computer science. Then on top of research,

164
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
you have implementations where people will
try to take research and Use engineering

165
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
skills to convert that into something
that's tangible. And then you have the

166
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
test of time, which kind of is the
ultimate teacher in life.

167
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So having things that are built on a
solid foundation and are introduced and

168
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
kind of go through this test of hardening
through time ultimately should be a goal.

169
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That doesn't mean you can't innovate,
right? It doesn't mean you can't extend,

170
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
it doesn't mean you can't provide
research. Certainly in Ergo we have led in

171
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
various areas of implementing things that
kind of came from the academic sphere. But

172
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I think there's an element of wisdom in
being conservative, right? And sometimes

173
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
that is not the focus of the crypto space,
right?

174
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Innovation is wonderful. But I would also
say that sometimes iteration is

175
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
innovation, right? Where you take
something, you extend it. it holds you

176
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
extended, it holds you extended rather
than trying to reinvent the wheel for the

177
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
700th time and it's good for marketing.
It's not necessarily good for security,

178
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
right? Because you have a weird curve
distribution where through time, usually

179
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
you have the research side, right? And
like the engineering complexity, let's

180
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
say, is much higher. And then through
time, as it becomes more of a standard, it

181
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
becomes easier to adopt, there's better
tools. Like that whole process of

182
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
evolution is not something that you can
cheat very effectively. It's something

183
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
that is much slower than the hype cycles
that people are taught, right?

184
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So I want everyone to remember when it
comes to security that time is ultimately

185
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
the test. We can look at kind of the first
principle of privacy, which is probably

186
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
fundamentally one of the most important
things we need to explore. There is some

187
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
potential future where the children people
in this room have could grow up into a

188
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
world where every economic transaction
they touch is audited, stored, and you

189
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
could watch every penny that someone has
touched throughout the course of their

190
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
life.

191
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That type of control system is getting to
the point where it's technically possible,

192
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
and that should frighten the hell out of
everybody, right? That type of system, I

193
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
do believe there are some powers in this
world. That's where they would like to

194
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
take humanity, right? Because it certainly
offers them greater power and control. And

195
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
so I think having the ability to remain
private, anonymous, have your personal

196
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
space is going to be one of the most
fundamentally important things that we

197
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
need to work to protect as an industry.

198
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And that doesn't just mean we're going to
add zero-knowledge proofs to everything

199
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
and have more control systems in place. I
think that's a bit of a perversion from

200
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,000
privacy itself, right? That's a trade-off
that many people see is quite sexy, right?

201
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Where we're going to have ZK compliance
and if you just get more and more and more

202
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,000
and more ZK compliance, you have a
stronger control system. So I think we

203
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
need to really look at this idea of
privacy, make that an absolute, chase that

204
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,000
on multiple layers of networks, rather
than have it be toy.

205
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Because in some cases, yes, it does offer
like visibility assistance in terms of

206
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
people not seeing your transactions or
what's happening, but in terms of the

207
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
broader assumption, it's toy privacy, it's
not real. And I think we need to be very

208
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
clear in terms of what our set of
assumptions are long term with privacy and

209
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
what the goals are with privacy.

210
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Because there are a lot of projects,
there's a lot of research Beyond Ergo

211
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
itself that is valuable in terms of
preserving privacy, preserving anonymity.

212
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I think that ultimately should be one of
the most important tenets of creating

213
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
censorship resistant systems and
censorship resistant money.

214
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
The other area has to do with inclusion,
right? We are seeing a mix in the space

215
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
where it comes to regulated assets.
non-regulated assets, bearer assets,

216
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
non-bearer assets. And that needs to be
something that there's a lot of clarity

217
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
with, because not everything in crypto is
the same. I know that in the social layer,

218
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
everything is a ticker with some letters
in it, right? But the underlying

219
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
assumptions that you need to make in terms
of custodial, non-custodial, is this a

220
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
bearer asset, is this not a bearer asset,
is probably going to get even more complex

221
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
when we start seeing regulated assets
appearing.

222
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
We've kind of seen some of this freeze
and seize with stable coins, but the

223
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
crypto industry is changing. Even
yesterday or two days ago, there's an

224
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
announcement that these 10 major banks are
going to collaborate and create some

225
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
stablecoin instruments. Oddly enough, they
tend to be the same banks that are in the

226
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
corporation that's on the hill, but that's
the side journey that probably not the

227
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
rabbit hole for right now. But that type
of assumption of inclusion is going to get

228
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
really important.

229
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I do know that Alex kushti, as many call
him, has been working on a whitelist

230
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
mechanism, which I think is probably the
better way to deal with uncertainty in

231
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
terms of power. where rather than you join
and you might get blacklisted at any time

232
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
for any reason, you make a voluntary
agreement. And hopefully there's clear

233
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
assumptions in that agreement in terms of
the risks that you're inheriting in doing

234
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
that, right?

235
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Last is probably this element of
resilience, right? And ultimately, I think

236
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
that's why open source code is so
important because good ideas are hard to

237
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
kill. I do hope not just within Ergo, but
within various aspects of the

238
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
cryptocurrency space and some of the
privacy space that's been around, we're

239
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
able to develop tools that ultimately
develop into truly resilient systems.

240
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I've operated under the belief that over
the long arc of time, the only thing of

241
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
value in cryptocurrency really is state
resistance. Everything else will probably,

242
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
in my opinion, distill down to the common
denominator underneath, which is

243
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
centralization. Right? Because if you're
not shooting for state resistance,

244
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
ultimately the most efficient thing is
going to prevail through time, and the

245
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
most efficient thing will be centralized.

246
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
No, maybe it'll be pseudo centralized. We
can have a debate whether Amazon Web

247
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Services is distributed, decentralized,
because you have data centers all over the

248
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
place that optimize speed. But I would say
that in terms of power distribution, we

249
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
have to be honest and say, OK, it is
distributed, but the actual concentration

250
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
of power there is pretty apparent.

251
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So over time, if we build on first
principles, I do believe that the crypto

252
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
space is capable of developing open source
tools for coordinating capital and

253
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
creating systems where within a certain
set of assumptions, we can assume honesty.

254
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Right? And luckily, at least with Ergo, we
have this proof of work mechanism that has

255
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,000
a pretty well time tested mechanism of
what are your assumptions of honesty? What

256
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
are your attack vectors? In terms of the
contractual layer that we've come up with,

257
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
it is relatively conservative. So I think
those are solid building blocks towards a

258
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,000
larger goal.

259
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Sometimes within the social layer of
crypto, you sign on to Twix, TwitterX,

260
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
whatever you want to call it, and you
listen to the commentary, the talking

261
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
heads. It does kind of leave you
wondering, what the hell are we doing? Why

262
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
are we here? And I think that ultimately
should be the most important aspect is we

263
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
need to have clear intent and clear
purpose. Because if you don't have clear

264
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
intent and clear purpose, you're not going
to be grounded in what you do. And crypto

265
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
as a whole, I would say, needs to be more
grounded, right?

266
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I do hope that over time we create a tool
set that's diverse enough, and again, an

267
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:23,000
extended UTXO that's going to be
contractual, it's going to be off-chain,

268
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:31,000
it's going to be front-end-wise. We create
enough tools around those three problem

269
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:39,000
areas, the trilemma, let's say, that we
can serve a diverse set of needs. And I

270
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:47,000
think sometimes marketing and kind of just
social spam buries that intent. Right?

271
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So my hope in going through All of the
presentations that we've set up, all of

272
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
the speakers, everybody here is doing
really unique things that are targeted,

273
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
that improve the assumptions, that offer
new tools and understanding that as a

274
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
piece that can be replicated within a
whole. over time I believe will lead to a

275
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
broader tool set that's powerful. And I
think we've done a pretty good job as an

276
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
ecosystem, developing open public goods,
sets of tools that have led to some

277
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
interesting things.

278
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,000
We just went through a major upgrade with
Sigma, Six new node version, right? And

279
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,000
that will open the door to a lot of new
capacity. And I hope that as we kind of

280
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
build to enhance new system capacities, we
stay focused in on mission. Because that

281
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,000
type of purpose I think is important. It's
not just important for like solid

282
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,000
programming, beyond the network, it's
important for the social system. And the

283
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
social system in crypto is very toxic.
It's just honest.

284
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I sometimes have said, my favorite thing
is seeing all of these tools that enhance

285
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
individual power takes responsibility. My
least favorite thing in crypto is people

286
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
that look for a savior, right? Because
that's not really how peer-to-peer

287
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
networks work. That's the client-server
relationship, my friends. So if we get

288
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
back to this idea of saying, okay, how can
we distribute power across peers and

289
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
empower peers to have tooling, to have
access, to have software that ultimately

290
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
can serve them and their needs, that's the
ideal for cryptocurrency.

291
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I would say everything else is just
digital money. And I think we need to kind

292
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
of lean into that because the
possibilities if privacy does not work as

293
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
an industry, if resilience doesn't work as
an industry, the trade-offs are huge in

294
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
terms of the world long term that could be
spun up around us. And sometimes I wonder

295
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
what kind of world my children will live
in, right? Like, I can see myself, I was

296
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
born into this strange system, you got the
people on the hill, you've got this

297
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
distribution of power that I can't really
touch or interact with much. But what

298
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
about the future? How much stronger could
that get theoretically? And that should

299
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
scare the shit out of everybody, in all
honesty.

300
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So for me, I think that kind of sums up
the purpose, the intent of why I'm here,

301
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
right? It's the only thing that matters.
So I do hope that as an industry, it's

302
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
something that we can mature around, look
at all of the trade-offs of control in

303
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
different areas and build wisely. So I'm
going to kick it off to MGPi and Luca. I

304
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
need to set up their mics, set up their
presentation, get them ready to go. But

305
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
thank you everybody for tuning in and
enjoy.
