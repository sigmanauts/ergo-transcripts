1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What's up, everybody?

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is Mick from BlitzTCG.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's been a little while since we've had
any sort of a real update from Blitz.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
First, I want to say pretty much all my
fault.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My life has been quite busy, and to
demonstrate that fact, I thought I'd start

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
with something I know pretty much no other
update's going to give you, and that is a

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
look at my life and what I've been up to
for the past four to six months.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Where do I start?

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I moved back in November. I changed jobs
back in November. I'm getting married so

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that's a thing. I started building this
horse pasture, putting in these posts by

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
hand - some of my 225 posts. I built this
horse shed.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This is sort of like a work-in-progress
picture. Let's see if we can find a newer

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
one, or I guess a more completed one.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Here's a more completed one.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Here's the horses themselves.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So needless to say, I've been quite busy.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Funds have been quite lacking, as you
might imagine, just given the state of the

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
world, number one, the state of crypto,
number two, and Blitz is of course a

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
project that requires funding to complete,
primarily because I am not talented enough

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
by myself to do the very many things that
need to be done to make the game

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
successful, and of course to highlight
that here, any of you are welcome to sort

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
of peruse the many people that have helped
bring Blitz to where it is today.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That all is to say though, at the end of
the day, Blitz is still a passion project

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
for me, still near and dear to my heart.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I still hope to complete it in totality
sometime in the near future.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It is slow going, of course you all will
know that from those of you who are still

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
following along.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But I do keep it up to date
security-wise. Everything's still working

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
on the integrations, APIs, the back end,
so on and so forth. We're all still

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
working as you would expect.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
There have been some minor updates here
and there. In fact, development was pretty

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
much continuing up until, I want to say,
April.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And then I had to pause again due to some
funding issues where I think about - I

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
don't want to overstate, but maybe about
halfway into completing all the abilities

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
necessary for Blitz.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So that's a positive.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And then the game itself, as many of you
know, is already downloadable, technically

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
playable, but you of course know if you
have played it, it's not in a great state

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
right now just because everything isn't
done.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So you can still log in, and I actually
added some animations. Animations are

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
freaking expensive, by the way, for any of
you who are curious about how much

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
hand-drawn animations are.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They're a lot.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The metrics screen is up there. I updated
some buttons to take you to the website

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and stuff.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Deck Builder still works. I think I made
some updates to this to make it a little

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
bit more snappy and also a little bit more
accurate for the cards you actually own

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
versus those that you don't.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So you can see I own one of those.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I fixed all the hover to discover options
at one point or another. So basically you

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
can hover over each of these different
things and it'll tell you what they mean

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
because there's a lot of different things
going on.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And Blitz that get a little confusing
depending on how knowledgeable you are

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
about the game.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So all that's still in place.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, and all the game boards are
programmed, so you can actually use all

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
the game boards now if you haven't played
around with that.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So a few things have happened.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But of course, I'm not going to beat
around the bush and make it out like we've

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
done everything that needs to be done.
We've done a lot. There's still a lot left

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
to do despite the game being in, I'd say,
a semi-decent state right now.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What else? I think that's really it. As
soon as, I don't know, the market bounces

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
even just a little bit, and I have some
more free time on my hands, I hope to pick

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
this back up.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm a little bit anxious to get my hands
back on the keyboard and do a little bit

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
more programming here. It's been a while
since I've really gotten into the weeds of

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
things, so hope to get back into the weeds
of things soon.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll keep you all updated when I have
updates.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The Discord knows that I don't post
updates too often, but if you do have

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
questions or you have any concerns or just
want to talk things out, I am available in

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
the Discord pretty much 24-7 and will
respond to you if you reach out.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What do I want to end this?

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Let's just say the Ergo community is near
and dear to my heart. I really appreciate

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
all of you. I hope to see all of us
succeed.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I hope to see Ergo succeed.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And I hope to see all of you doing and
building on Ergo succeed.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I mean it's a lot of work to even bring
something to this degree live on a

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
blockchain and on a backend and on a front
end and with a website - it's a lot of

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
work. So make sure you all don't knock our
community developers too hard because a

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
lot of work goes into this stuff even if
some of these projects aren't maybe to the

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
point you want them to be quite yet. All
that being said, thank you all again.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Truly hope everybody's life is going
towards the positive in these crazy times.

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'll stay in touch and best of luck in
the year folks. Take it easy.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Bye.
