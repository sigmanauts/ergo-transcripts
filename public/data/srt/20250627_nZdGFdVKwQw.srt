1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How are you doing?

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Doing well. How about you?

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm doing good. It's a good day to be an
Ergonaut.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, like every day.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Every day. Every day is a good day to be
an Ergonaut.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
kushti, congratulations on 6.0 release
and 6.1 release. That's fantastic. Amazing

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
feat.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Right, so everything released. I'm
working with miners and yeah, everything

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
is good at the moment.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah, I mean it only brought the chain
down for what? Two hours, right?

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Sorry?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It only brought the chain down for about
two hours with that new release. It's a

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
joke, kushti, Ergo doesn't go down, come
on!

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah, I mean, no any downtime, so yeah,
we are good with everything, and yeah,

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,000
let's see how our voting will go. So in
case of success, we will have activation

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
of 6.0 around October and well we can
actually have hopefully sub-blocks more or

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
less ready by the time, right? That would
be awesome.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Mid-October, late October, let's see, but
we start... We can start injecting nodes

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:09,000
in the internet. Someone here hired some
spots here. I think in somewhat stats into

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:21,000
the public.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,000
All right. You should be able to, you're
glitching a little bit, kushti. You got

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
some bots running.

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Shut down the mixer shut down the other
stuff I think seconds

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yep, yep, yep. So with 6.0, with the
mining pools, they do not need to change

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
any parameters if they vote yes, right?
That's how you wrote this one. So if they

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
want to vote no on it, they have to have a
parameter into the node. If they want to

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
vote yes, then they just run 6.0, and
they're good to go. And voting should be

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
done on, what is it, October? Is that
October? No, sorry, not October. July 12th

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
or July 11th, something like that?

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah, beginning of the warning and then,
yeah, well, if there will be enough votes

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
in one month and a half, right, like 90
plus percent, then, yeah, we will have

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
then delay for activation for another one
month and a half for everyone to better

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
update, but it's not necessary for this
update. So it's really soft. So if you run

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
5.x nodes or even 4.0.100 something, then
yeah, well, everything will be fine. So

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
for 5.x nodes, yeah, your nodes will just
skip validation of new scripts and that's

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
it. So it will validate all the current
scripts even.

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So no, no sub-blocks on 5.0 nodes at all.
They will just ignore them.

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, and they also ignore the new
parameter, the voting for changing number

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:47,000
of sub-blocks per block on every chair, so
this is the new voteable parameter

41
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,000
injected into 6.0 logic, consensus logic,
but yeah, well, thanks to the art of soft

42
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:05,000
fork ability, 5.x nodes will just keep
this parameter and watching for changing.

43
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Have you ever had a soft fork that was
close? Or has it always pretty much been a

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
landslide? Like, you know, something where
it was going to be close whether something

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
would pass or not?

46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So we had a couple of soft forks before,
right, so EIP-27. which yeah was quite

47
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
soft like this one so it's nothing
controversial where where 50% of the

48
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
miners had it one way 50% the other or
close to that oh but so it was about 90

49
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
plus percent as well so soft forks require
for 90 plus percent oh 90 percent for soft

50
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
forks. Yeah. So, 50% just to change
non-critical parameters like size and so

51
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
on. But yeah, for soft forks, you need for
90 plus percent to avoid appearance of

52
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Ergo classic, something like that, you
know, so Ergo classic.

53
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Even if you have like 20% disagreements,
15% initially it was for Ethereum Classic.

54
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No, it's better to avoid. And yeah, so for
Bitcoin Cash, I believe it was also

55
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:43,000
something like that. So yeah, we require
for 90 plus percent agreements for soft

56
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
forks, not just one half, because then you
may have, I don't know, even 60 versus 40

57
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
split, right? And such split is still kind
of annoying, probably, right?

58
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, 40% is quite a few better people,
yeah, for sure.

59
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Very divisive, but yeah, well, if you
require for 90-plus percent, then yeah.

60
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There is a little chance, well, another
fork will survive.

61
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Well, if Mark's listening from the SIGS
mining pool, we've got a double job there.

62
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We've got to do a Paideia vote first, and
then you can implement the 6.0 node on the

63
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
thing. So it's a double vote, essentially.
First and then to implement.

64
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So, what's going on with Sigmanauts
mining pool? Is it open to more

65
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
experiments like FIMO and so on? Yeah,
FIMO, right.

66
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah, yeah, 100% fair, a fair initial
mining offer. Yeah, that'd be amazing.

67
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Right now we are working on, Chi's got us
a new build of storage rent, and Mark's

68
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
spinning that up on testnet just to make
sure everything's going to go okay. Just

69
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
be, you know, storage rent tool is, you
know, sometimes it takes a little nudging

70
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
to get it going great, but we don't want
to put that on the main pool until we're

71
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
sure. So he's firing that up on the
testnet. We have to ask Chi to build us a

72
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
6.0 node for storage rent as well. So
we're going to work on that. But yeah.

73
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's going well, going very well. I love
the SIGS pool. If anybody's mining out

74
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
there, join the SIGS pool. It's more than
a pool, kushti, it's a community, I should

75
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
say.

76
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Well, it's truly Ergo-oriented, so we can
try some new things with Sigmanauts in the

77
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
first place. Well, with 6.0 there will be
better support for sidechains, including

78
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
trustless two-way pegged merge mined
sidechains. A lot of words, but yeah, it's

79
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
a really cool thing. Not quite possible in
the world of Bitcoin or Monero, but

80
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
possible here. Then there will be support
for efficient trustless relays for Bitcoin

81
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and Bitcoin-like blockchains and so on.

82
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:45,000
As Ergoversary is coming. Yeah, some
announcements also coming in regards to

83
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:54,000
that and yeah, well here I think sigma
mining pool also can help with

84
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:03,000
experimentation right and getting the
ecosystem to the new frontiers

85
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Andy wanted us to remind people, speaking
of that kind of stuff, that the Ergo hack

86
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
videos are being released today,
yesterday, tomorrow, throughout the day.

87
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So make sure you check up on those. You
watch everybody's hard work on the Ergo

88
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
hack. If anybody's ever done an ergo hack
before, it's a lot more difficult than it

89
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
sounds. You have a limited time to do
something and so basically you ignore your

90
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
family and your life for how many ever
days it takes just to get something done.

91
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You know, typically in a normal coding
experience, you run into always something

92
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
that sticks you, right? That you can't
figure out or it's just not working like

93
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
you think it's going to work. So in a
normal environment, I just set that aside

94
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and go into something else. But in an Ergo
hack, you're like,

95
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Nope, got to finish this to make deadline
or else it's just not going to work kind

96
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
of thing. So it's a lot of work that all
these developers put in to ErgoHacks to

97
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
get things rolling. So go ahead, watch
their videos and see what they're doing.

98
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And hopefully, since this one is based on
AI, you might get some ideas that says,

99
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
hey, you know, if people that aren't devs
or they're hobbyist devs can do these

100
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
complex apps that interact with the Ergo
blockchain, maybe you can too. Kind of

101
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
thing so don't shy away from that and
check out those videos, but Ergoversary I

102
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
just got done recording a video with our
own Dan the man from Japan How he praised

103
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Ergo blockchain for enabling

104
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You know his winter protocol which can do
on chain... What are they called? Oh W...

105
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Something assets. I can't remember. I was
a plate last night And how Ergo enabled

106
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
something like that And why they chose
Ergo. So that was a lot of fun to

107
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
interview him a quick 30 minute interview.

108
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So please check that out. On July 1st is
the Ergoversary. We are going to do a

109
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
special AMA two days early on July 1st.
It's going to be myself, kushti, Joe,

110
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and... Who was the fourth? I've forgotten
who the fourth was, Andy. Maybe Andy can

111
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
text me. But I'm pretty sure there were
four of us. So that's going to be a lot of

112
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
fun. Who was the fourth, kushti?

113
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Maybe Dan? I don't know.

114
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No, what's her name? I can't remember. It
was Dan. It was Dan, yep.

115
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Okay, so it's me, Dan, Joe, and qx().

116
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I think we reached out to CW. CW,
reaching out to CW as well, but he's in

117
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Australia, so poor guy needs some sleep, I
guess.

118
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It would be funny to have five or more
people on the table, but I'm not sure

119
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
about connection issues. We can try at
some point. Yeah, Ergoversary is coming,

120
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:13,000
so yeah, well, be ready to spend some time
on July 1st to watch videos, watch AMA. I

121
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
guess we will have some community chat
also, our Telegram Discord.

122
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh, that's a good idea, yeah. So, yeah,
prepare your drink, like tea, I don't

123
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
know, coffee or coffee.

124
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Call in to work that day just so he can
watch all the things. Focus on Ergo only.

125
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah, and be ready to have fun around
July 1st, like we had a lot of fun,

126
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
actually not really, six years ago.

127
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Six years, that's crazy, kushti, six
years old.

128
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah, yeah. But yeah, it's actually quite
amazing. I mean, living through all those

129
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
six years, and I will think that's, yeah,
I mean, new people are coming all the

130
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
time, right? Proposing some things you
haven't thought about even, and yeah,

131
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
they're doing something.

132
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I just, I think it's commendable that
Ergo has stayed true to her thesis for six

133
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
years amongst all the crap that's come
down the pipe and all the temptations, I

134
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
would say. I mean, how tempting is it to
do back-end deals with you know token

135
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
supplies and those kind of things and I
know it's hard for Ergo just because you

136
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
know, we were a fair start and the only
good place to get stuff is exchanges right

137
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
or from directly from miners So it's a
little harder for that kind of thing to

138
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
happen But I think it is commendable and
it speaks to Ergo how in six years It's

139
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
only gotten stronger and it's resolved of
what it is and how it functions and what

140
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
it's supposed to be

141
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah, and how well basically all the
issues got resolved somehow, right? For

142
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
example, if there are some issues with
centralized exchanges, basically hate

143
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
fairly distributed assets these days,
right? Well, they simply prefer some,

144
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
well, straight rugpulls, memes, scams,
fart coins.

145
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Well, it's hard for... It's hard for
central exchanges to extract value and

146
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
liquidate shorts and longs if they don't
have a big chunk of the supply themselves,

147
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
right?

148
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I think, well, they will get into issues,
right, because of that, especially, well,

149
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:06,000
when we have more and more, well, straight
rugpulls, even, not from, like, small

150
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,000
scammers, but, yeah, I mean, pretty big
so-called blockchain projects now going

151
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:22,000
through VC rugpulls, like Mantra and
recently RWN Rowan somewhat, I don't know,

152
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:30,000
so it's got minus 90% because kind of
owner of the project, I mean, which is

153
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:38,000
already, that sounds pretty horrible,
right? I mean, among all the marketing

154
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:46,000
gimmicks in regards to decentralization
and so on, yeah, so we have some owner.

155
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,000
which is dumping straight like minus 90%
in a day. And yeah, before there was

156
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:04,000
another VC rugpull when it was like 95% in
one hour because of coordinated VC

157
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:12,000
rugpulling. So, yes, centralized exchanges
love that and getting back to the initial

158
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,000
point.

159
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Well, the Ergo community then went to the
road of bridging rights to blockchains

160
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:39,000
with some liquidity already there are like
Cardano, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain,

161
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and they will be more and more. And then,
yeah, well, Rosen Bridge is going to be, I

162
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:57,000
believe, its own vault, right, with
multiple blockchains connected. It would

163
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:06,000
be kind of a saver for many blockchains,
actually, right? So these days if you

164
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:15,000
are... for many blockchains, actually,
right? So these days if you are...

165
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:24,000
We had to be mostly paid to centralized
exchanges in case of a fair launch. We had

166
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:33,000
to do with Ergo because back in 2019, it
was quite obvious that you cannot get

167
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:42,000
listed for free. You need to pay all
those. So, yeah, I guess most of the

168
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:51,000
treasury actually was paid to centralized
exchanges. It wasn't avoidable, right? But

169
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:00,000
yeah, nowadays you can launch a blockchain
and the only thing you need is to

170
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Basically, the Rosen Bridge integration
rights, and you can do it for free.

171
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's what I was going to say. That
should be a clear indicator to projects,

172
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
right? When they look at how to spread
themselves over other ecosystems or access

173
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
via exchanges, look at an exchange, right?
Even a project like Ergo, who says, look,

174
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
not Coinbase, Kraken, look, we will we
have devs community devs core devs that

175
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
are willing to do all the work, right? The
exchange is like yeah. No, thanks. No,

176
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
thanks Whereas somebody like Rosen Bridge
has released documentation that says oh,

177
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
hey You want a bridge to all other
ecosystems that were connected to you want

178
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
back doors to exchanges? Here you go.
Here's how to do it. So, I mean, I think

179
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
once, you know, that hooks on to people
and they see that, at least devs seeing

180
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
that, or chain creators, I think that's
going to be the obvious pathway to

181
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
adoption there.

182
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yeah. And then, especially when Rosen
starts doing vaults and fast lane and

183
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
direct on ramps, I think that's a game
changer for sure.

184
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Right, so for new chain you may have
cross-chain and liquidity pools everywhere

185
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:37,000
since day one and it would be good for
first month at least, quite enough, so it

186
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:45,000
is definitely better than what we had. In
the first one year, actually like 14

187
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:53,000
months before GATE.io, what we had is just
terrible exchanges with drunk support like

188
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Tidex.

189
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Drunk? Did you say drunk support?

190
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yeah, so I mean the the the support in
the force Just drunk I mean, I don't know

191
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
if it's good
