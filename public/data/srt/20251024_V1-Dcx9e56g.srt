1
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll take the blame if it is. Yeah, I
don't hear any sound on the YouTube. Let's

2
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
give it a second. Grayman entered, let's
allow Grayman in while Andy's fixing the

3
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
sound. Let me hit live here. Let's see.

4
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Unmute. Yeah, yeah, we are here, we're
good, we're live. All right, back to - oh

5
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
no problem Andy, we're gonna flog you
after the show. All right, starting again.

6
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Good morning everybody. Welcome to the
Ergo AMA. We have kushti, Benzel, and

7
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Grayman with us this morning. You saw us
go through the visual of the Ergo update.

8
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We hit it all, actually. There's three
updates this morning. So I'm sure you read

9
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
it exactly as we were saying it. You
probably read it in kushti's voice, right?

10
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Actually, sorry. Yeah, hello everyone.
Because yeah, it seems greetings also

11
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
miss. So yeah, also yes, him is a game of
proms. So yeah, also. Oh, what do you see

12
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
that was down here? It's about for Lisa
sexually.

13
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh nice. I haven't finished the contracts
in front in for game of proms yet. Just

14
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
sharing a tell you a few weeks ago.

15
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh, yeah, so there is telegram group
where game of proms can be discussed and I

16
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
love it. It doesn't really have any use at
the moment, but if anyone's interested,

17
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
feel free to use it.

18
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Nice Josephine, that's awesome. Yeah, and
back to Lithos as well. Guys, if you

19
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
haven't seen the videos, I split up all
seven or eight videos from the Ergo

20
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
meetup. I ran them through AI and got
summaries and bookmarks and all that kind

21
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
of goodness and put those in the
description of YouTube and I posted them

22
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
in a series in YouTube in a grouping so
you can go to that whole group. Joe starts

23
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
it off and then I think I didn't pay
attention to the order after that, but Joe

24
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
starts it off and then everybody else is
after that. But if you have a chance go

25
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
see the Lithos chat - that was a very
popular, very popular talk. Cheese always

26
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
does an amazing job breaking things down
simply so you can understand him. And he's

27
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
got that ASMR cheese voice, which is
fantastic.

28
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So check that out. Also with Lithos I
believe they will need some test net

29
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
people firing up their rigs in November at
some point. So that's really exciting to

30
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
see that going. Amazing. All right, let's
kill the dev update here. What is the news

31
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
today, guys?

32
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We've got some big news in the crypto
sphere, right, lately. And kushti's coined

33
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
a term for the season. kushti, what's your
term for the season?

34
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So it's the rug season.

35
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The rug season. Oh, man, you know, with I
think something the other week too I

36
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
forget what it was. Oh, Amazon, right?
Going down and this kind of stuff

37
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
happening. It really shows how important
real decentralization and peer to peer

38
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
networks are for resiliency, right?

39
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Right. Yeah, but now we have like, so
yeah, this Amazon outage. Yeah, it's

40
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
showing well, kind of decentralization we
have, right.

41
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah, it's like Amazon's a canary in the
coal mine there, right? You don't know

42
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
who's attached to it until it actually
dies. Then you're like, oh, really? You

43
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
know, your entire back end was relying on
the centralized service, you know, kind of

44
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
thing. The only thing we noticed is the
same day one of our load balancers for

45
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Cloudflare was banning one of our
redirects for the GraphQL. I don't know if

46
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
it was related or not, but it doesn't
matter. It's fixed momentarily with that.

47
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But yeah, really, really telling, I'd say,
of the industry for those kind of hangups

48
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
there. And about Kadena, man, that's
absolutely bonkers, eh?

49
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I think it's expected, actually, and we
should expect from all that. Actually, for

50
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:09,000
many years, well, over the span of many
years, it's now kind of standard, right?

51
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:18,000
When we have a blockchain, which is run by
a single company without community,

52
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
basically, or with fake community, right?
Which is basically existing only as

53
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:36,000
mercenaries right? So some I don't know
well projects which are only milking

54
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:45,000
grants around, then yeah paid shillers and
so on. But well, it's all working right

55
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:54,000
when the markets are fine, but well, if
they are not, then we see what we saw like

56
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:03,000
yesterday, right?

57
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So, well, and we will see more of that.
So all those, well, company owns

58
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
blockchains, well, whether they will
transition to community control, but it's

59
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:27,000
very unlikely, right, so one control is
grabbed. There is a little chance to

60
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
become normal. And then the second option
is it would die probably. So, well, it

61
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
would be good to help the Kadena
community, but yeah, we're the first

62
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
place. We need to find their community,
right? So, I joined their group just like

63
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
yesterday. And yeah, well, I haven't seen
any seeds, you know, of community action.

64
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So, for example, back in 2016, when we
had Ethereum, proof of work, proof of

65
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:23,000
stake. No, it wasn't. Yeah. So it was,
these, the DAO hack rights and yeah, chain

66
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:33,000
owners had chosen to roll back the chain,
right? After selling, the court is low.

67
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And then, yeah, there was active community
disagreement, right? And that's how

68
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Ethereum Classic got appeared. But then,
even, no, it was like a few days maybe

69
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:03,000
after Ethereum Classic was born. So me and
Charles Hoskinson, so we appeared on some

70
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:13,000
podcasts and defended the Ethereum
Classic.

71
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So yeah, but back then it had just a few
supporters around the world. And yeah,

72
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
well, now it's doing quite well, more or
less, I believe, right? But yeah, back

73
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
then it wasn't quite clear whether it will
survive coming weeks or not. But yeah,

74
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
well, we got some traction around. Yeah,
well, these days it's much worse. So

75
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,000
basically we have all those companies
controlling blockchains and then crowds

76
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
running from one blockchain to another
while waiting for pumps, right? And then

77
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,000
usually they got scammed everywhere. Then
yeah, well, running away from the whole

78
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,000
space, claiming that crypto is scam. I
mean, of course it's scam if you are well,

79
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,000
chasing scams. So no, no, no, no surprise
here.

80
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So, yeah, basically, no any community
action. I witnessed just some shilling.

81
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah, you're usually done by the same
company, blockchains, right? The shillers,

82
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
maybe paid shillers mostly. So that they
just shoot the same company block chains

83
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
in the Kadena group. And yeah, the
shilling was like just trust me, bro. So I

84
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
mean, well you're saying they're shilling
new block chains in the Kadena group that

85
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
you saw? Some existing some existing block
chains, but from what I've seen here on

86
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
only the same company owns rights. And
yeah, the shilling was basically like,

87
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
trust me, bro. So I mean, like, then our
team was bad, but our team is good. Trust

88
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
me bro, all that nonsense. I would be
surprised if anyone is buying that in

89
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
2025.

90
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah, you will be prepared to be
surprised, right? Once you're used to

91
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
those kind of things, trust me bro as part
of being part of a community to be part of

92
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
the exit liquidity or just be there to
bolster the price of a project. It's a

93
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
quite different experience than being part
of a community of something that you

94
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
believe in that's going to make a
difference and is fair in all those

95
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
matters. It's much harder, I would say, to
do what we're doing here with Ergo and

96
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
what you've done with Ergo over the many,
many years to build that community and

97
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
have that community stick around as
opposed to somebody that doesn't, and it's

98
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
centrally run, and decisions are always
coming from the top instead of, you know,

99
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
from the bottom up or the side out kind of
thing. So it really becomes apparent in

100
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
situations like these where, you know, the
top crinkles and dies, and then was there

101
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
ever a root system to actually sustain new
growth? So, I mean, that's a question,

102
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
yeah.

103
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah, so then what can we do here? I
think, well, if some community action

104
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
would be seen, so, well, what can we
propose is to switch from ASIC mining to

105
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
ASIC resistant, right? So basically,
Autolykos, and in this case, we would have

106
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
trustless pegging with Kadena, which would
be good for Kadena as well right. So now

107
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
it seems to be a smaller blockchain well
by market cap probably not only right

108
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
because well if the chain would survive
well so somehow something would then yeah,

109
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
well, it would be small, right? Because,
well, I mean, this company, Blockchains,

110
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
it seems, yeah, I mean, they're always
talking about good tech, good tech, but

111
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
when you know that the company is
disappearing, no one is interested in good

112
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
tech. And that's quite clear in this
Kadena case, right?

113
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah, there are 20 million market cap
right now, unfortunately for them. Yeah,

114
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
that's rough.

115
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah, so CannonQ told our telegram that
they raised 200 million, was it? Yeah, so

116
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
absolutely bonkers, where's that go?
Where's it? Where is that where to go

117
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
salaries?

118
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Where is that where to go salaries? Maybe
next time in Las Vegas, you can do some

119
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
search around under the couch cushions at
the Bellagio by accident.

120
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah. Oh gosh, yeah, it's interesting.
You know you sit back and you think you

121
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
know, what would what would Ergo be right
now if the community was given money for

122
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
development funds beyond that kind of
thing that much at least? That'd be

123
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
absolutely insane. I think I think you
guys have quoted and Joe's quoted many

124
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
times that the number one expense in Ergo
has been exchange listings. Yeah, it's

125
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
like 70 percent maybe of all the time and
most of that's wasted, actually.

126
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Done. Wasted. I mean,
even before, so from exchanges I got

127
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:44,000
listed back in 2019, only probate, I guess
still alive. So heartbeat disappeared.

128
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yep. And well for others I don't remember
their names even well so some were free

129
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:04,000
some not but yeah basically most of 2019
expenses just disappeared somewhere with

130
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:14,000
those well guys, let's say politely. Then,
yeah, well, other listings, yeah,

131
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:24,000
basically. So, yeah, the biggest article
and yeah, well, also our long period quite

132
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:34,000
useless after all, right? But well, we did
what was requested by community after all.

133
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That's what I can say.

134
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah, a lot of community feel that that
kind of access is necessary. But honestly,

135
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I think we're at a, not a crossroads, but
I think we're at a parallel intersection,

136
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
if that makes sense. I think still the
people who are interested in a project

137
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
like Ergo, fair launch, peer-to-peer,
decentralized, may be running parallel

138
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
with us because those people that are
actually interested pretty much should

139
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
know how to access us, right? I'd say the
people that are jumping on chain right now

140
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
for things like corporately centralized
projects through central exchanges, that's

141
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
maybe more their cup of tea. I think we're
still a bit away from the overall adoption

142
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
of, you know, slowly, slowly you can see
that kind of thing eroding, but it's

143
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
interesting.

144
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You see, in my eyes, I see this corporate
structure of crypto, like half of Solana

145
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
going down when Amazon goes out. I see
things erode, right? You see these central

146
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
entities erode, but in the end it also
reveals those central entities that can

147
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
continue to sustain and stand up because
they have so much money pumped at them. So

148
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
instead of this large island of
centralized bullshit, now instead you have

149
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
maybe several pillars of huge tall
skyscrapers of these centralized

150
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
bullshits. And so there's less of them,
yeah, but there's still main strong ones

151
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
that are there and in your face. So it's
not like, I don't feel like, you know,

152
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
while we're losing these, you know, as it
goes along, which is great, it's the big

153
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
ones are still going to get taller and
taller. So it's not, we're always going to

154
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
have that to deal with, I believe, and
always fight against, in my opinion.

155
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Everybody else asleep? Grayman? HQ?
Benzel? They're all great here. Here we

156
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
go.

157
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
He's awake. I am awake. I'm here. I love
the rents. I'm in agreement with with

158
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
everything that you've said so far. I got
into crypto late and fortunately landed in

159
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Ergo via Cardano and the eloquent Mr.
Hoskinson.

160
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Cardano is a gateway drug to Ergo. He
should make a t-shirt.

161
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Well, so I think I managed to, you know,
Bitcoin, Cardano and, and Ergo, I think I

162
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
managed to avoid corporate scams, but
there's a phrase that I used to hear a lot

163
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
back in the day. I mean, we've been
talking about this shit for years. It's

164
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
not like this is a new thing. What was the
regulatory arbitrage? And essentially the

165
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
concept being that if you want to make a
bunch of money by being a scammer, you're

166
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
going to have to do that in a way that is
not regulated by the current system. And

167
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
so what do we have? We have Binance owning
effectively 70% of the transaction base of

168
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
the industry or something like that,
something way over 50%. And where are they

169
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
even based at this point? Like they've
hopped around.

170
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I mean, the chair of the board, I guess,
CZ, spent some time in the US jail. I'm

171
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
not sure about all the details of that
stuff. I know he's free now, but it's just

172
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
a mess. I mean, this is anything but
decentralized, especially if you're

173
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
keeping your coins on their exchange. But
also in terms of the way that they control

174
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
the order book and the flow of
transactions, it's crazy that people think

175
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
of this as crypto and get excited about
it. And that's sort of like another

176
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
trading account, another exchange for
them. And it's their favorite one because

177
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
it's totally lawless. But then the end
result is that 95% of people get

178
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
completely rugged, especially the ones
that engage in any kind of leverage

179
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
trading, because somebody else is running
the train, and they say when it stops and

180
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
goes, not you, and it's not about
guessing, it's about them maximizing their

181
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
profit, and it's a corporation, guys, and
it's not a well-regulated corporation.

182
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So to me, it's insane to watch all this
happen. I think it's going to get worse,

183
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
unfortunately.

184
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Yes, such huge transfers of wealth
happening, you know, with these dips and

185
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
these shorts and everything. Absolutely
mind boggling how much money is

186
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
transferring to more wealthy people here.

187
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Yep. So I don't know if there's really
much more to say than that. I feel blessed

188
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
that I never really got involved in that
part of the so-called industry. I mean, to

189
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
me, it literally is just a scam. It makes
no sense. I mean, they do sell Bitcoin and

190
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
they do sell Cardano, and that's great.
But that's fine. If 99% of what they sell

191
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
are tokens that they extract hundreds of
thousands of dollars from the community

192
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
and team and then get a bunch of tokens
and then as soon as they get listed they

193
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
dunk on them and they drop off I mean,
it's like a vampire. I can't believe

194
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
anybody participates in this but there you
go. Like they say the path is littered

195
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
with bodies.

196
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So Ergo is walking a different path. We
aren't even like, I mean, I think that at

197
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
one point there was a negotiated position
with Binance US and the Ergo Foundation,

198
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
which at the time was maybe, let's just
say more well endowed entity than it is

199
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
now as time has passed. They voted it
down, wisely so in retrospect. And we

200
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
never really had that much money in the
till as a community because I think the

201
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Ergo Foundation was founded after the
chain got started and funded by less than

202
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
5%, more than 4%, but less than 5% of the
coins as they were mined. And so initially

203
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
that led to a lot of ERG but not worth a
lot of dollars, and so there was never

204
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
really an opportunity for Ergo to play in
that space unless some whale decided that

205
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
they just wanted to underwrite it. And
surprise, surprise, none of them did,

206
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
because they recognize that that whole
game is rigged and that it doesn't make

207
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
any sense to play it to just hand your
money to somebody that's going to come and

208
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
insist that you give them more to keep
playing. It's worse than a casino.

209
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So I don't know what else to say. I feel
bad for everybody that got hurt by that.

210
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But at the same time, you know, some of
those people just need to get washed out.

211
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
They're not here for the right reasons. To
the extent that we see some of that in the

212
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Ergo forums, I just sort of shrug and
it's, it's, I mean, I'm sure there are

213
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
some people that look at whatever I post
as being painful to read through or, or a

214
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
skip over.

215
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Oh, it's just painful to listen to you
talk, Grayman, even for me, you know, I'm

216
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
just kidding. Love hearing you talk, sir.

217
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I don't know. I don't know what to say.
It's, it's hard to, it's hard to see.

218
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It's, it is people saw complaining about
it.

219
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I just I can't I can't really even
understand their motivations. So they get

220
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
sold this, you know, put your money in and
you'll get 20% 30% 40% rich. I mean when

221
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
you go to a central exchange and they're
advertising to hold a stable coin and get

222
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
like 10% returns or whatever that bullshit
is. I mean in a normal person's head that

223
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
would like, how is this sustainable?
What's going on here? So they're roped in

224
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
by these kind of things of absolutely
ridiculous returns, and then this kind of

225
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
stuff can't be sustainable. The liquidity
providers, and when I say liquidity

226
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
providers, I mean the fools in their
money, dry out.

227
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Yeah. I mean, to be fair, I also, when I
first started trying to learn about all

228
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
this stuff, I was also led to these
exchanges and whatnot. All of the talk of

229
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
here's where you go to get this and
whatnot. And it just seemed like it was

230
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
such a broad and crazy space that the only
way to get involved was to just grab some

231
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
close by piece and start doing stuff. But
it was pretty quickly, pretty easy to

232
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
figure out that this is crazy town, like
this is worse than a casino, and I have no

233
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
interest in doing that. I could just play
the stock market.

234
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I mean, I guess a lot of the way that I
think about it might be privileged by

235
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
being an American, especially an older
American towards the end of my career, or

236
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
last third, let's say. So I have a little
bit of time and money and wisdom and I can

237
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
see you know, what's obvious bullshit. I
think a lot of the people that get trapped

238
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
are people that were just out of college
and you know, they're just trying to get

239
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
out in the world and swim and somebody's
got a good comment in chat.

240
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
That's related to this. Mobius says fuck
profit, can't think like that. And I think

241
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
that's the problem, right? I think people
need to be able to understand that there

242
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
are many profit opportunities in Ergo.
Many. There's SigmaFi, there's arbitrage,

243
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
there's SigmaUSD Bank. There's a lot of
profit opportunities in Ergo. There's

244
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
MuShop, you know, for physical goods for
profiting off that. A lot of profits,

245
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
okay? And that's a sustainable profit.
That's a profit that actually can sustain

246
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
itself. What we're talking about here is
obvious scam profits where it's a pyramid

247
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
scheme where the idea is you make a profit
because somebody else is there to lose a

248
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
lot, right? That's the difference that
we're speaking about here. Profit is fine.

249
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Nobody should shame anybody about profit,
right? And there's plenty of opportunities

250
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
in Ergo to do so. There's a huge
difference between that and what you're

251
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
seeing at central casino exchanges. Huge
difference, Mobius.

252
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah, but profit that's made from a hype
machine is just at the expense of the

253
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
losers. Yeah, exactly. And it's not going
to be sustainable. So it doesn't make any

254
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
sense. Yeah, you have to build slowly but
surely tools that can be used and

255
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
eventually the exponential turns the
corner and starts being faster than you

256
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
can even get ready for and eventually
becomes an asset.

257
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You can't build a foundation on balloons.
One of them pops, you're done.

258
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Yeah, so Ergo has been slow and steady.
It's getting better and better. It's sort

259
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
of the Kaizen mentality. Every we just
got, you know, node six has just come out

260
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
already starting to think about the
repercussions of that and how to turn it

261
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
into sub blocks and getting back into
finance online. There's a lot of stuff

262
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
that's cooking and it didn't start cooking
yesterday, right? It's been going for a

263
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
while, consistently working on building
and making it better as a tool, not as a

264
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
toy or as a fad. And that feels like what
all of this pumped out fun shit is. It's

265
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
just let's try and make a fad.

266
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's like Ergo is perpetual soup,
Grayman. It's always been cooking for a

267
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
long time and you come back a year later
and it might taste different, but it's

268
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
been cooking the entire time.

269
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Right, yep.

270
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yeah, HQ's got a question in chat. A good
question, actually. A good for HQ, that's

271
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
for sure. Question, what would be the
outcome when EF publishes similar

272
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
announcements as Kadena, as they are
running out of funds, etc. Should we be

273
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
sharing on socials why EF actually isn't
behind the core Devon, etc. ETC nowhere to

274
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
go. I think we've been preaching that as
often as we can, HQ. I think everybody out

275
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
here on the AMAs has made it very clear
that EF's overall goal was - kushti's

276
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
gonna jump in with this. I said EF. EF's
overall goal is to fade into some other

277
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
part of existence. You know, their goal
was to bootstrap in that sense. Sorry, go

278
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
for it kushti.

279
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Yeah, so well as a guy who actually
founded EF, I'm finding all those talks

280
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:51,000
strange. So it seems well at some point
well the EF got perceived as a kind of

281
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,000
main entity, maybe establishing entity.
But actually it was established a month

282
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:07,000
after the main at launch. It was November
or December 2019. And yeah, to that

283
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:15,000
moment, well, Ergo was listed on like five
or six exchanges, right? So, well, the

284
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:23,000
development went well without EF and so
on, right? So, well, I mean, things were

285
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:31,000
made without the EF for starters, right?
So for many months and yeah, well, then

286
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:39,000
basically since 2022, I believe, so Joe
and me and others, I believe also, well,

287
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:47,000
pushing the idea that EF is well, by
definition is not around for forever,

288
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:55,000
probably right. I mean, no one knows,
maybe it can find some ways to exist

289
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:03,000
forever. But to the best of my knowledge,
that there is no any human made

290
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:11,000
organization, which lived forever. Right.
Even to survive for like 20 years for a

291
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:19,000
foundation or a commercial company is
already quite exceptional. I know such

292
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:27,000
corporations, companies, but we simply
don't know. Thousands disappeared, right?

293
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So, well...

294
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I think kushti, I think you should...

295
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
They've handed off a lot of their
important duties already to the SIGs and

296
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
to the Infradow, and there's still more
that they retain, but those could be

297
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
handed off as well. I mean, one that's
really stand out for me is ErgoDocs is

298
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
just spectacular and updated and it's very
in depth and it's going to be sad to see

299
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
that sort of official duty of the EF
disappear along with everything else when

300
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
that time comes. But presumably the
community will pick it up and maintain it.

301
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
We just need to get to that point. There's
also the website, which I think is quite

302
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
good as is, but apparently there's a new
one coming at some point and that's great.

303
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
But, you know, that's also something that
in the future, I mean, what's Bitcoin.com?

304
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It's whoever owns that domain. We're going
to have to move past the idea that that

305
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
like, what's the website for Linux? I
mean, it just, you know, there's something

306
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
that just needs to go away.

307
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Get some onion links for the Ergo hosted
website. That'd be great.

308
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Makes a little too exclusive for the
website. So another one is coming. Well,

309
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:18,000
it's coming. Yeah. For many, many months,
but they can't push because it's just

310
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:26,000
volunteer some volunteer. Yeah, well not
paid by any party and well, I've seen some

311
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,000
drafts a few months ago and recently, I've
got a message that it's basically ready.

312
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So wow, I can check it in days and and
then, yeah, let's see when it will be

313
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:50,000
launched. But it would be different from
EFs. And I think it's also good, right?

314
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It's OK for diverse.

315
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
We could actually launch that directly on
infra for now, if we want to, at least for

316
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
the, you know, just launch straight to
that. And then you can live side by side

317
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
for a minute and we can make sure it works
and go from there.

318
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
That would be interesting. And yeah, so
that's another website is more sci-fi

319
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
punk-ish. And yeah, well, it's made to the
guys' preferences. And yeah, no one can

320
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
judge here.

321
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I do hold .erg. And if we guys want to
release something .erg, so maybe we can do

322
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
platform.erg and release that on there.

323
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You bought the entire endpoint there the
entire what's it called? How much was

324
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
that?

325
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It was gifted from from handshakes. Yes.

326
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Oh you bought the handshake. Yeah, I got
you. Okay. I was gonna say cuz dot Ergs

327
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
gotta be some country in Europe or
something, right? Yeah. Let's see, .erg

328
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
is, I don't know. I don't know. But I was
back to community guys, when you're

329
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
talking, I feel like, I feel like, a good
community in, like Ergo is, should be,

330
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
yeah, HQ3rr is going to start a country. A
good community is, like the ship of

331
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Theseus. You guys familiar with that?

332
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
So that's a thought experiment that says
if you have a ship, a wooden ship, right?

333
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
You guys, we'll save for everybody online.
If you have a wooden ship and over

334
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
hundreds of years you replace every single
board, you know, one at a time or every so

335
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
often, and after many, many years the ship
is totally different boards. There are no

336
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
original boards in the ship or sails or
anything. Is at the same ship, right? And

337
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I think a lot of people say, yeah, it's
the same ship, right? So I feel like a

338
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
good community is like the ship of
Theseus, right? You have, you know, the

339
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
community back in the day, it's still the
Ergo community, the community in the

340
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
future is still the Ergo community, but
it's changed so much, might not even be

341
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
same members, right? But the mission
remains the same, the experiences, the

342
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
experience, the historical knowledge base
remains the same. All that kind of stuff

343
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
moves with the community as it comes
along. So I think that's an indicator of a

344
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
good project that has something like this,
not something that's just a captain that

345
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
runs around on whatever ship has the
biggest sail. And then if the ship sinks,

346
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
he's like, fuck off, I've got my treasure
chest, goodbye. And then it goes down for

347
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
good. Whereas this kind of community is
very resilient.

348
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I wanted to add to that prior question of
how would that situation be perceived by

349
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
the community? I think it would be
celebrated even from the tone of the

350
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
organization themselves releasing it,
wouldn't be in the tone of how Kadena

351
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
released it. The EF will be glad to say,
hey, this has already been the plan. So to

352
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
answer the question directly, I think it
would be a good thing, a good sign for

353
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
that announcement in our community versus
how it was accepted in the other one.

354
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I think you're right, Benzel. I think
you're right, because we saw this already

355
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
pre-played out with Joe leaving the EF,
with kushti leaving the EF. It was like,

356
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
oh, you know, this is expected. This is
what's happening. It's like kids going off

357
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
to college. It was a sad day, though.
Yeah, it's sad, but it's like, oh, this is

358
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
what's supposed to happen. This is
evolution of what's supposed to happen. I

359
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
love your sweatshirt. Did you get that at
the meetup, sir?

360
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
This is my physical airdrop. This is how
I got the claims of free stuff right here.

361
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
This is my airdrop. All right. Did you
get a hat?

362
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
This is the only free airdrops we do is
physical in person.

363
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Did you bring a hat back with you from
Colorado?

364
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Oh, I didn't. I think Chris got them all,
so I might have to ask him to ship me one.

365
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Chris took them all?

366
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
No, no, no. He grabbed them because they
were left there. I guess they could have

367
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
been in that church for a bit.

368
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I think he posted on socials like, I
don't know how, but I have got these. So

369
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
maybe he was drunk and he took all of
them. I got a shirt too.

370
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Oh, the mining shirt. That's awesome.
Fantastic. I'm wearing my sweatshirt that

371
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I stole from Joe at Vegas a couple of
years ago.

372
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
He was supposed to give me his Rosen
Bridge sweatshirt, but it's the only one

373
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
he has so I didn't want it. But he still
have to steal it like you have to steal

374
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
it. I can't take the only one you have I
feel bad.

375
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
That's what he does. That's Joe's MO.
He'll bring something leave it on a chair

376
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
and expect somebody to take it. You know
take as much control over Joe's

377
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
merchandise as you can. I think it's the
same. You know, I still haven't washed

378
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
this in two years. It still smells like
Joe.

379
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It's perfect. You know this disc that's
awesome.

380
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Old-school cool.

381
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
What's that?

382
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Old-school cool like steal this disc.

383
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Those are
the days, right?

384
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
No, overall I'd say my sentiment towards
Ergo always remains the same, right?

385
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
There's no external factors that make me
think, oh, you know, I'm worried for the

386
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
future of Ergo. It's all that, yep, this
is like watching a play play out that we

387
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
know the ending to. This is exactly what
we expected to happen to this centralized

388
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
entity, you know, and here we are just
trucking along. Sorry, Grayman, go for it.

389
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
But that sounds like a godlike
perspective. I'm just in the soup. I don't

390
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
know how it's going to end, but it gets
better and better for me. So I know we're

391
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
going in the right direction. I mean,
there could be a wave that goes and

392
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
smashes the entire thing apart. But I
doubt it, I think there will be a wave

393
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
that'll smash almost the entire industry
apart at some point, sooner or later. I

394
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
mean, if nothing else, a decade from now
when Bitcoin's halving takes it to the

395
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
point where there's no security budget
anymore, that's going to be a hell of a

396
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
wave. And when that happens, it's going to
be a question of who can survive that

397
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
tragedy. And I think that we're aiming in
the right direction.

398
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I mean, if you say fuck Binance, sorry,
bleep that out. But if you say that you

399
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
don't want to deal with Binance or any of
these other extractive exchanges, well, we

400
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
have ways to deal with that. We have Rosen
Bridge. We have very soon we have Machina

401
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Finance, which will make it so that we
have long chain liquidity that's

402
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
constantly running and that can be done
with Rosen bridged assets. And so to be

403
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
fair liquidity bootstrapping is always a
problem and one of the biggest complaints

404
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
about a smaller blockchain or community.
But there's something where you can

405
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
literally put your money where your mouth
is and allocate a portion of your holdings

406
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
to trading and liquidity according to a
robot that you set up to do it. And you

407
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
can rest assured that it's still going to
be self custody within your wallet and

408
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
that you have ultimate control over the
whole thing without dealing with Binance,

409
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
you know what now, right? It's there. The
ball's gonna be in their court in the long

410
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,000
run when that wave crashes and destroys a
lot of stuff. Hopefully it destroys them

411
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
too but we got to have a way for people to
interact and I think we've got it and I

412
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
think we lead the industry in that sense.
There are other tools on other systems

413
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
that are close to this, but not the same.

414
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I think Ergo is extremely well positioned
for the rug season. For starters, is

415
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Binance now available in the US?

416
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I don't know. I don't touch that.

417
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It's a Binance US domain that the
government kind of made them give up

418
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
ownership of that.

419
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Yeah, it's different things though,
right? It's quite a bit limited compared

420
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
to the other Binance, if I recall
correctly.

421
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Separate, but probably run by the same
crowd of crooks and so therefore not so

422
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
separate.

423
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
But the Binance Smart Chain is the bridge
between the two, I believe.

424
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Well, anyway, probably it's worth to
consider to withdraw from it, especially

425
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:53,000
in the US, because I think at some point
we may see maybe the second term or

426
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:01,000
another crackdown. Well, because, yeah, it
seems now, well, crypto Twitter are full

427
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:09,000
of accusations, right, towards Binance,
hard to say. Well, well, so some are

428
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:17,000
definitely real, because, well, the
exchange is scammy, as well as its owner,

429
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:25,000
right, and people around. Well, but, yeah,
well, as usually in such things, well,

430
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:33,000
maybe it's kind of preparation, right, for
some actions also. Hard to say at this

431
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:41,000
point, we'll see. But yeah, it's better to
stay away from all CSAT related. So it's

432
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:49,000
actually much worse than Kadena and so on.
All his assets, like DEX tokens and so on.

433
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:57,000
They are not even pretending to be proof
of work like Kadena and so on, just some

434
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:05,000
tokens printed by the guy to his own
pockets then yeah well partly distributed

435
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:13,000
but yeah for BNB still more than 70
percent in his pockets so he is simply

436
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:21,000
controlling the market and the...

437
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Well, another thing is, well, why I'm
thinking about rug season. So many people

438
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:40,000
in this crypto space did await for all
season, right? Well, and they provided

439
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:49,000
some probably valid arguments that markets
are cyclical and so on. Right, and I

440
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:58,000
think, yeah, those arguments are
convincing, but only in the presence of

441
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:07,000
markets, right, so more or less free
markets. So in the case of, well, markets

442
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:16,000
like we had in 2013, 2017, so mostly proof
of work cryptocurrencies, well, mostly.

443
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Well, also proof of stake cryptocurrencies
distributed through ICOs, right? So, well,

444
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:34,000
quite well distributed after all, in
comparison with today's nonsense, like

445
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:43,000
oligarchs tokens. So, yeah, well, if
markets would be similar, then, yeah,

446
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:52,000
maybe we would care for all season. But
with tokens, which are dominating in the

447
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:01,000
market now, we simply don't care for
markets, right? So, well, it's not markets

448
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:10,000
when supply is basically controlled and
can be changed for free at any moment. The

449
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:19,000
owner of a token can just send a portion
to an exchange and liquidate everyone. In

450
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:28,000
this environment we don't have markets, so
it's quite about manipulations,

451
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:37,000
multi-level manipulations. Instead of alt
season, we have rug season, so it's not

452
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:46,000
cyclical markets behavior. It's not about
markets after all this crypto space at

453
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:55,000
this point. So we need for all these dots
to be washed out somehow and that's what

454
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:04,000
we are starting to see maybe.

455
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Yeah, I think too, going off what you
just said, kushti, I think people also

456
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
flock to familiar, right? So that's
exactly how the fiat world works, right?

457
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
You know, it's always them against the top
against retail, right? And cryptocurrency

458
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
was supposed to, and is supposed to, and
what Ergo is doing, is balancing that out,

459
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
right? It's making it so that it becomes
apparent who is the person that holds most

460
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
of the things and can just manipulate as
they like. So, you know Ergo follows that

461
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
but a lot of other chains do not and just
mimic what they see in the fiat world. So

462
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
when people flock they are looking for
somebody to be a leader. They're looking

463
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
for some organization to own something so
they can feel safe. When in reality there

464
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
were never even safe in the fiat world
when that happens, right? It's a classic

465
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
example of the walrus and the oysters,
right? You know, you're led to a table for

466
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
dinner.

467
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,000
This would be a good time to plug Joe's
talk on the Meetup.

468
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Yes, great. Go for it, Grayman. You plug
it.

469
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I mean, you're basically just stating
what a third of the talk was about, was

470
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
that, you know, we just need to not look
for leaders, but look for solutions. Yeah.

471
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And, you know, that's, it's worth
watching. All the talks are worth

472
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
watching. That Meetup was a spectacular
event for me. I haven't worked my way

473
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
through all of them, but I did rewatch
Joe's and it stands up everything about

474
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,000
it's perfect. It was off the cuff and
spoke from the heart and it anticipated

475
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
what we're witnessing happen right now.
So, you know, I don't want to gloat and

476
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,000
watch all these people suffer from the
market falling apart. I hope nobody takes

477
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
it that way. But yeah, I mean it seems
inevitable to me. So on that level, I hope

478
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
people get out before they get hurt and
find a safe place to be and that could be

479
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Ergo. I hope it is but it could be
whatever land precious metals, you know,

480
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
whatever you can do to secure your your
your future and your you know your your

481
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
treasure is worth doing because sticking
around in the crypto system where people

482
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
can rug you at any moment is not a good
place to be so?

483
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yeah, I would say don't look for leaders.
Don't seek out leaders in this space. Seek

484
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
out, lead yourself and seek out peers,
right? You know, I mean, it's perfect if

485
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
you want to, you know, like, it's amazing
to be like, Joe's amazing, kushti's

486
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
amazing, Grayman's amazing, it's great to
hear them talk. And that's great. But, you

487
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
know, like, we could have somebody that
fucks up big time, right? Like, let's take

488
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Cardano and Charles Hoskinson. What if
something is revealed that's absolutely

489
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
awful? Right? There goes the chain. Done.
Right? There's a whole leader of the chain

490
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
it's looking at. Right? And whether that's
due to the community looking to Charles to

491
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
lead or Charles not letting go, you know,
fully, I don't know. But that's dangerous.

492
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Right? So trust yourself. Lead yourself
and seek out peers. It's 10 o'clock.

493
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I got to go, boys.

494
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Yeah, there we go. Hold on, everybody.
We've got to roll out the outro. We all

495
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,000
need you. Hi, everybody. Good morning.

496
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
All right, everybody. Let's say some talk
for next week. Amazing for everybody to

497
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
join us. We had Benzel, kushti, Grayman,
hq3rr, and meta. Sorry, go for it kushti.

498
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
What are you gonna say? Benzel?

499
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Yeah, so as always let's continue our the
text chat. So Grayman I will jump on chain

500
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:08,000
cache basis chat a bit later with silver
sense and so on. Then yeah, let's continue

501
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:16,000
to discuss. So if we can find something
like a Kadena community, then yeah, let's

502
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:24,000
try to organize space with them. But yeah,
we still need to find community. So they

503
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:32,000
have a group of 35,000 people, but I
haven't found any community there. Tourist

504
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:40,000
base? Yeah, so we can do Twitter space
once they somehow self-organize to discuss

505
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:48,000
what to do with development and so on,
right? So we may offer them to switch to

506
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:56,000
ASIC resistant proof of work and so on,
right? So to do some crisis management

507
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:04,000
and... So, but see also in regards with
community organization, we can share a lot

508
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:12,000
of experience, right, because we have a
lot of experience got our the six years.

509
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:20,000
But well, there are a lot of companies
that own blockchains around and we need to

510
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:28,000
educate the users before the blockchains
get collapsed.

511
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I have a question. Why not set up example
and just bring them, adopt them to the

512
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Rosen Bridge and bring the whole chain and
use the wrapped assets on Ergo instead of

513
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
giving them another solution to adopt to
it, how to like us and that.

514
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
So what's the community there? It's a six
community miners, right? What are they

515
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
going to do on Ergo? Sell their ASIC for
GPUs? What community is that? I guess,

516
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
yeah, yeah, good. Where's Joe? Get that
shit together, Joe.

517
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Yeah, because we have, we already have
and we need a test. We need to test it

518
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
with something. And if we have opportunity
to show someone that they can do it here.

519
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So if it happened today with Kadena,
tomorrow it will happen with another

520
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
chain, which are run by VCs or they are
run by companies. So they have a pathway

521
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
to join and go and see how they can have a
more decentralized and everything more

522
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
controlled. how to do it and we will learn
how to run the sidechains also.

523
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Yeah actually a good idea right so well
if for some reason well usually for having

524
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:51,000
big losses and well inability to fix them
so someone is still a stick to a company

525
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:59,000
owned blockchain right so we may offer
well, just to try Ergo for starters as a

526
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:07,000
plan B, right? Because, yeah, well,
inevitably, any company like 99% will go

527
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:15,000
bankrupt, right? And then, yeah,
blockchains associated with them will be

528
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:23,000
collapsed as well. So, I don't know,
what's the statistic for commercial

529
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:31,000
companies outside crypto? I think in 10
years, like 99% of companies.

530
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It's big, yeah.

531
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Yeah, and I think in crypto it should be
even more, right, because this space is

532
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
crazy.

533
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Well, plus, in crypto it's global, right?
In crypto, it's global. So, you know, it's

534
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
not like a small company in Arkansas that
jumps up is going to have an effect on

535
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
somebody in China, right? So, but in
crypto, you could start up a chain and

536
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
it's immediately 100% global right off the
bat. So yeah, I agree, kushti. It's more

537
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
than 99%.

538
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
It's also global on Amazon, maybe. Yeah,
it's not just geographic distribution,

539
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
though. It's also distribution of
applications and industries that we can

540
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
support. So we are a platform, not a
company. It's a cathedral. It's a place

541
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
where many different types can come to
worship and participate in our little

542
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
religion that we're growing here. It's a
cathedral, and we need to think of it like

543
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
that, something that's going to last for
hundreds of years. Mistakes will be made,

544
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
but they'll get ironed out before hundreds
of years, something's for sure.

545
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Plant a tree so your children can sit in
the shade, right?

546
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Yeah, exactly. So I think, yeah, it
should be promoted as kind of a cathedral

547
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:05,000
or Unix, right? Because well, Unix at some
point also adopted this cathedral

548
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:13,000
methodology, right? So just to build in a
composable way. So we are composing simple

549
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:21,000
tools, right? Something impressive, our
decades, maybe centuries to come.

550
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Guys, that's a good place to end it. I
really have to go. So great talking to

551
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
everybody here today. kushti, do you want
to end it?

552
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Thank you. Bye. So let's continue. Yeah.

553
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Continuing checks to everybody. We'll see
you next week. Same time. Thanks so much

554
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
everybody. Bye bye.
