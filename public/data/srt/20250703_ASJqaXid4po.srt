1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Happy Ergoversary everybody.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm QX and with me we have Dan, the man
from ZenGate, Dan Friedman.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You might recognize him from Dan. I love
the hat. Where'd you get that hat from?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This one weirdo gave it to me at some
event or something like that. I don't

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
know. You know, it's just, well, what does
it say anyway? What is that?

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Make mining great again.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh, okay. It's MGA.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
All right, Dan, let's, you know, as
somebody who's in the ecosystem as myself,

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
sometimes I find that I miss out on things
or I'm not completely clear on things. So

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I think this is a great opportunity to
talk to you about what the hell ZenGate

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
is, what the heck Palmyra is, how Ergo
helps those kinds of things be possible.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's start at the top. What's ZenGate,
Dan?

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, ZenGate is actually right behind
me. We're in the ZenGate office right now.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
In Japan. Yeah, in Japan. So this is
ZenGate Japan behind me. We have a couple

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
other ZenGate offices, but this is the
main one.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I mean, just, you know, long story short,
we're a technology company utilizing

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
various different technologies like Web2
and Web3 to fulfill one of our core

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
missions, one of them being opportunity
inclusion for MSMEs, micro, small and

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
mid-sized enterprises, which are
businesses that mostly produce

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
commodities, although we're not limited to
commodities, but they're kind of like the

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
bedrock, they're the lifeblood of the
world.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And so I thought that I was going to
build a company, was going to work with

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
that sector because that's where the most
impact is. And again, another big first

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
principle of ours is real world impact,
RWI, which is again, what our technology

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
is here to provide.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, and so that's translated in a
series of products, which we call the

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Palmyra ecosystem and the Web3 part of
that, which is the Palm Economy. And

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
essentially, it's a platform that again
creates opportunity inclusion for MSMEs.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We largely deal with commodity and
commodity producers in developing

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
economies.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And we do everything from giving them
more market access through the Palmyra

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
platform, Palmyra that app, which is
basically a commodities trading and

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
purchasing platform that utilizes Web2 and
Web3 for traceability, for authentication,

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
for logistics, to essentially bring, to
cut all the waste, cut all the gray area,

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
cut all the black box-ness out of the
process and essentially just connect the

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
producer with the buyer, with the consumer
and to make both happy, to make sure that

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
the producer gets the most optimal value
for their commodity and so that the buyer

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
gets the most optimal value for the money
they spend and get what they pay for what

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
they're buying.

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What's blockchain have to do this? Why?
Why blockchain? And you could do this on

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
some sort of proprietary system.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So basically, I mean, one of the core
components of this is traceability. And we

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
all know the traceability is something
that blockchain is really, really well

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
positioned for - immutable traceability.
One of the main issues with commodity

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
trade is the lack of transparency and the
lack of traceability and essentially

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
adulteration and counterfeiting.

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This happens across the commodity sector
everywhere you go. And I'm not just

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
talking about commodities that are traded
on commodities exchanges like the golds

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and the silvers of the world. But say, for
example, a commodity like honey. This is

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
one of our pilots right now is with a
Zambian honey firm called Nature's Nectar.

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And so what we did was we put several
thousand producers on chain for

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
traceability and authentication purposes
for the honey because statistically honey

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
is one of the most adulterated foodstuffs
in the world. It's literally one of the

54
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
most adulterated foodstuffs because of the
lack of transparency between what happens

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
from the producer, the bee hive keeper and
the producer that is say in Zambia, to

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
when it hits the shelf at your local
wherever you go shopping over there in

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
upstate New York.

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So when you say that you mean that the
honey farmer is going to get a tiny bit of

59
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
the pie when it's on the shelf, it's going
to be 10, 20, 30 times more than that guy

60
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
sold it to them for.

61
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, it's not just that. It's not just
that it's going to be 10, 20, 30 times

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
more expensive than what they actually
sold it for. It's also not going to be the

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
same product in many cases. It is going to
be mixed in with syrups, with other

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
substances. In fact, there was a study
that I bring up quite often that was done

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
a few years back that says that
potentially almost 80% of all honey in the

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
West is not real honey. It is honey
flavored syrup or it might have a

67
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
percentage of honey in it, but it's
actually not real honey. It's not 100%

68
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
pure honey.

69
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And so this is why it is so important to
have traceability, because in the end, the

70
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
producer wants to give you honey. They
want you to buy their honey. But what

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
happens between when the producer sells
and when you get is what needs to be,

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
that's where the transparency comes in,
and that's where transparency is lacking.

73
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Basically blockchain, one of the things
that blockchain does is it helps create

74
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
that transparency. And so what we have is
called a Winter Protocol, which was built

75
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
on Ergo and it's a full traceability and
tokenization protocol. And so this

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
protocol is being used to track and trace
in this case, and it has many different

77
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
uses, but in this case it's used to track
and trace the honey literally from the

78
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
beehive because the actual beehive is on
chain to when it actually ends up with you

79
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and in fact this honey is going to be
available through another one of our

80
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
portals called Palmyra Express really soon
and we're going to have it at Rare Evo

81
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
which is coming up in less than two
months, I think.

82
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Is that a site that any normal consumer
could go to and just buy like a

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
marketplace?

84
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah. So up until now, all of our
products have been and all of our

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
commodities have been B2B. A lot of our
business has been B2B oriented. There were

86
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
minimum quantities that you could purchase
for various reasons, because a lot of

87
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
these guys are not retail stores. They're
bulk producers. So, you know, you can't

88
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
ask them to send you, like a half a kilo
of tea. You can ask them to send you 100

89
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
kilos of tea, 50 kilos, but not a half a
kilo.

90
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
However, we got so much, so many requests
from our community members saying that,

91
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
hey, guys, I just want to try this stuff.
Can I just buy this stuff? And so what we

92
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
actually did was we created an internal
infrastructure where we ourselves purchase

93
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
from these producers and then create
limited quantity offerings to the

94
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
community through Palmyra Express and
that's expressed with an X.

95
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And so you can get there several places.
I don't even know which domain name we're

96
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
going to put out there, but I registered
all the different variations of it. So you

97
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
can go to palmyra.express. To get to it,
you can go to palmyra.express with an X

98
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
because the actual branding is with X, but
then, you know, some people might get that

99
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
wrong and want to just have an express.
You can also go to palmyraexpress.com,

100
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
just palmyraexpress, then
palmyraexpress.com. All roads lead to

101
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Palmyra. That's basically what it is.

102
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
How does this work from a logistic
standpoint? Do you have like locations in

103
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
the United States or that kind of
continents there? Yeah, somewhere in

104
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Europe and you store them there and then
ship from there. You're not like shipping

105
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
right from the producer immediately one
off to somebody in the US or one off to

106
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
somebody in Europe.

107
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It depends on the actual commodity.
Sometimes it's going to be directly from

108
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
the producer, sometimes it's going to be
from us because we're going to set up a

109
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
fulfillment operation as well. Now for
these particular offerings that we have,

110
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
what we're going to be doing is we're
actually going to be purchasing from our

111
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
producers through our U.S. company and
then we'll be able to resell this directly

112
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
to the community that is in the U.S. and
Canada.

113
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And so these orders are going to be
fulfilled through the ZenGate U.S. entity.

114
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And so like I said, sometimes it's
directly from the producer, sometimes it's

115
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
through us because it takes a really long
time to get it from the producer because

116
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
of various different reasons. Like say the
producer might be in a developing economy

117
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
that just does not have expedient
logistics. And so, of course, you know,

118
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
while, you know, if you want to get this
stuff directly from the producer, you take

119
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
it into account. You don't want to have
somebody who's buying, you know, a jar of

120
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
honey wait to have to wait a month to get
it.

121
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So, I mean, honey is good forever,
though, you know, in fairness.

122
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah, actually, yes. That's actually
something that many people don't know.

123
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Honey does not have an expiration date. It
is it does not expire unless there is, you

124
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
know, other outside things that are
introduced into it that can go bad. But

125
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
pure honey itself does not expire.

126
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So I remember as a kid, we had we had a
beehive in my house when I was a kid and

127
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
we used to grab the old honey off the
shelf that was all crystallized. And my

128
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
mom would just put it in a little double
boiler for like 20, 30 minutes and it'd be

129
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
normal honey again.

130
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's all the same. it's sort of the same
with maple syrup as well you know maple

131
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
syrup or literally do put expiration dates
on it it literally just turns to you know

132
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
turns to the crystal turns to sugar right
yeah and sugar doesn't have an expiration

133
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
date and so yeah to bring it back to life
like i had this you know, big, giant thing

134
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
of Canadian maple syrup, I probably had
for the past, like, eight years, you know,

135
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and it's still like half full, because I
don't really use that much corn syrup or

136
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
maple syrup. But once in a while, I'll
have some pancakes.

137
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And I'm like, shit, man, I gotta get once
in a while, you'll have some pancakes,

138
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Dan, let's be honest here.

139
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Well, when I'm in the U.S., okay, but I'm
saying I'm not in the U.S., yeah, of

140
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
course. When I'm in the U.S., the pancakes
are a regular thing, but that's because I

141
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
compensate. I try to increase the pancake
intake, and then some people. Some people,

142
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
although I invite them to IHOP, I invite
them to my pancake breakfast, give me shit

143
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
about, oh, it's so far away, oh, wait a
second.

144
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I only missed it once, Dan. I've been
every other time, just once.

145
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah, you missed it once, and that's one
time too many QX.

146
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
All right, so tell me, give me, give me,
I've never heard a specific rundown

147
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
exactly just from what I've read and in my
head of actual traceability of how it

148
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
works. Can you take us through a journey
of a baby tea leaf in Sri Lanka and when

149
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
it gets, when it gets registered on chain,
what steps along the way it also gets

150
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
registered on chain when the initial
registration happens, all that kind of

151
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
goodness. Give us, give us that. Let's
name the little tiny tea leaf Earl, we'll

152
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
call them Earl as an Earl Grey.

153
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's a he what if he doesn't identify as
they them, they they they. Thank you.

154
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Thank you. Come on. Come on. 21st century
got to be inclusive.

155
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Okay, so again, it's not. Well, again, I
don't know if I said it this time, but

156
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
traceability is not like a one size fits
all solution. So in different cases, you

157
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
can have different levels and granularity
of traceability. And in the end, you get

158
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
down to like, is it really necessary? I
mean, how deep do you wanna go? Because

159
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
you can go really deep with traceability,
but in the end it's like, okay, yeah, but

160
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
if you go this deep, I mean, really, what
is the value here? What are the chances if

161
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
you go this deep that this particular part
is actually adulterated or screws up? And

162
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
sometimes you're like, okay, yeah, there's
a, you know, it's like a 2% chance

163
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
something's going to go bad if you don't
have traceability at this point. But you

164
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
think about it, well, 98 out of 100 is
still pretty, pretty damn good. So you

165
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
have that, you know, you have that
threshold that you come up with.

166
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Now, if you are at they, a tea leaf that
is being traced, again, it could start all

167
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
the way from the orchard. And so the way
they do it is they utilize a protocol

168
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
through what we call Palmyra Pro. And so
the Palmyra Pro is part of the Palmyra

169
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
suite that utilizes traceability and
really is tailored for, it's producer

170
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
focused.

171
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So a lot of data gathering and a lot of
data processing happens when it's still in

172
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
production, right? So for example, with
tea, it's not just like a robotic process,

173
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
right? Sometimes it is, but really with
the finer teas, what you have is a special

174
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
formula for when it is picked, which tea
leaves are used for which types of teas,

175
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
which grades of teas, how the tea is
dehydrated, how the tea is cured, how the

176
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
tea is stored, how the tea is packaged and
processed.

177
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
All of these things can create a unique
taste and a unique variant of the tea. And

178
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
so one of the main things that, for
example, happens with tea is producers

179
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
often have to record the process of how
the tea was cured. And then when the tea

180
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
comes out, they taste it and they see,
okay, so this batch came out really well.

181
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What was the process? What was the
humidity? What was the hydration time?

182
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What kind of process we used for
dehydration? Which kind of crop was it?

183
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Where was the crop from? Like all these
different things, they take into account

184
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
because all these different things have an
effect on what it tastes like.

185
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And so what you want to have, especially
in premium blends and brands, you want to

186
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
have that premium consistency. And so that
is like, for example, for tea, that is

187
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
important. That's why traceability is
important for that. And so what they do is

188
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
a lot of times they'll just start right
from the orchard. There is, there are

189
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
places like say Sri Lanka that have year
round tea harvesting, you know, just it

190
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
happens in batches. And that's how they
set up these tea orchards.

191
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And so you can start with actually
registering all the different tea

192
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
orchards, site A1, site A2, site A3, in
whatever batches you have, however your

193
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
tea bush is organized. And then you can
put in things like, say, for example, pH

194
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and weather patterns that were present
when the tea was growing. Then you put in

195
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
information, again, using Palmyra Pro,
when the tea was picked and how it was

196
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
picked. Was it machine picked? Was it hand
picked? Which part of the tea leaf was

197
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
picked? at what time in the day, at what
elevation.

198
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And again, elevation, they have low, mid,
and high elevation teas, again, that

199
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
create different types of crops. And all
of this is gathered through Palmyra Pro.

200
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
All this data is gathered through Palmyra
Pro. So what does that do? Number one, and

201
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
again, it goes all the way to when the tea
is packaged and shipped off. And it can go

202
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
beyond that. You can put in logistics
information. You can put in a warehouse

203
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
storage information, say if you want to.

204
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
For example, you can use IoT devices. And
again, a lot of this uses IoT devices for

205
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
obvious reasons. You can check the
humidity level of the warehouse that it

206
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
was being stored in. You can put that on
chain. You can then also do shelf life.

207
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Tea has, I believe, something like a
two-year shelf life. So you have to also

208
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
go and put that on chain if you want to.

209
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And so all this information goes on
chain. And again, you decide how granular

210
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
you want. You might not want to put all of
it on chain. You might want to put some of

211
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
it on chain. Again, it's up to the
producer utilizing Palmyra Pro to gather

212
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
the information, to process the
information, to catalog the information

213
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and then to present the information to the
producer themselves for various reasons,

214
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
for internal stock keeping, for recording
and processing of different crops and what

215
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
comes out.

216
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Regulations and compliance, for example,
they have to go to say the Sri Lankan tea

217
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
board and they have to bring records of
how the tea was grown to get a

218
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
certification of some sort to exports, you
know, getting export certificates and

219
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
where they have to fulfill different
various different in some situations,

220
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
like, for example, exporting to the EU and
the US, they have to fill various

221
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
different regulation requirements, right,
reporting requirements.

222
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
One of them is called EUDR. It's the
European Union Deforestation Regulation.

223
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And it goes into effect, I believe, next
year. And so while tea is not a commodity,

224
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
it's on that list, there is a list of
essential commodities that are on that

225
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
list. Anyway, there's about, I think,
yeah, but almost a dozen commodities.

226
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And so these commodities starting next
year, they're going to be required to have

227
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
mandatory traceability information to be
able to sell in the EU. And if they don't

228
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
have this information, they cannot sell in
the EU. And in fact, if they don't have

229
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
this information and they bring products
into the EU and try to sell them, they

230
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
could actually be permanently banished
from being able to sell in the EU.

231
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And so this is really scary for people
who like, they're gonna like, okay, so how

232
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
do we do this? Because there is no, you
know, the EU didn't say, okay, yeah, so

233
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
just use this system right here and you're
gonna be able to comply through it. It's

234
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
like, no, you have to have traceability
information. It's like, okay, how do we do

235
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
that? You figure that out. That's
basically what they did. And so that's

236
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
also Palmyra, Palmyra Pro, that's what it
does. And again, under the hood, all this

237
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
is run on the Winter Protocol, which is on
Ergo.

238
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So Dan, so I have a friend in the paper
business. And one of the big things that

239
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
this big, he works for connecting paper
suppliers, paper mills to the actual

240
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
people who, you know, cut and package the
paper after that, they'll sell the huge,

241
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
huge like, you know, six foot tall,
massive rolls in the truck to the company

242
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
who will then slice them up into paper
sheets or whatever, depending on what they

243
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
want kind of thing.

244
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And the thing that his company does is
they have their own traceability protocol

245
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
that's proprietary, right? And the
advantage of that is all these companies

246
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
that they're with and these mills are
with, all their data is stored in that

247
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
proprietary system. If they want to find
somebody else to do their stuff, it's

248
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
probably going to be a headache, right?
It's probably going to be a probably going

249
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
to rethink that kind of thing.

250
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So do you feel that the trade-offs of
using a blockchain where everything's

251
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
open, where another company could come in
and maybe offer more of a service, maybe

252
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
offer some different things and just say,
oh yeah, your database about all your

253
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
traceability is public right now. We can
just copy exactly what's going on there.

254
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And that's what we do. And you'll just
continue to add to your traceability

255
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
history right on that same chain that you
were doing it before. And you're not going

256
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
to notice a difference kind of thing.

257
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So do you feel the trade-offs of using
the blockchain where something like Ergo

258
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
where what we've had like zero downtime
since launch kind of thing and the

259
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
cheapness of creating the traceability on
chain outweighs those benefits of trying

260
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
to keep something close to us and trap
that customer in essentially?

261
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Well, the thing about that is I mean,
aside from just information being on

262
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
chain, it's all about how it gets there,
right? And so there's a term that is used,

263
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
it's called minimum viable ecosystem, MVE.
And so for you to be able to actually

264
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
create an optimal or an efficient way of
reporting, you have to have that minimal

265
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
viable ecosystem for this to happen. And
that happens when people are trained. That

266
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
happens when people are onboarded onto
something like Palmyra Pro. That happens

267
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
when there are processes in place that
utilize Palmyra Pro. And so you can't just

268
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
switch it out for something else just
because the information is on chain. It's

269
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
how it gets on chain is also important.

270
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And so, yeah, of course, I mean, there
could always, I mean, there's always going

271
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
to be competition out there. But it's not
just about the pure information that's on

272
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
chain. It's about how that information is
gathered. It's about how the minimal

273
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
viable ecosystem is deployed. It's about
the onboarding. It's about the integration

274
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
into it. A lot of companies will not just
go, oh, that's just cheaper and let's just

275
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
do that. They will look at all of this.
Okay, yeah, it might be cheaper, say, per

276
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
month to utilize this, but what is it
going to cost us to actually switch over

277
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
to this? Or what is that company, for
example, what are they going to do to grow

278
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
with us? Because you also have to be able
to grow with these businesses and

279
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
understand what they need.

280
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
For example, when we integrate and when
we deploy Palmyra Pro with our producers.

281
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
We work with the producers. It's not just
like one of those things like, you know,

282
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
you sign up and tomorrow you're using it.

283
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Right. Right.

284
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I mean, you could create that type of
version and eventually we will have

285
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
something more just a bare bones type of
thing where you just kind of DIY the whole

286
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
thing. But to really have that really big
value add that comes from on chain

287
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
traceability, you have to work with the
producer, you have to understand the

288
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
particular use case. And you have to
understand all the nuances. And so that's

289
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
actually where a lot of the work is.

290
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Yeah, it sounds like we have this
discussion, I think a couple of weeks ago

291
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
on the AMA about, you know, with open
source software, it's not necessarily the

292
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
tech part of the project that you're
selling to the customer, you're selling

293
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
your service and something better than
somebody else can provide at the time kind

294
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
of thing.

295
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, essentially it's,
it's that, you know, it's not just about

296
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
the pure functionality. It's about the
experience that is around the UX, that's,

297
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
that's surrounded. And a lot of times, the
UX just cannot be copy pasted. You know,

298
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
it's, it's, you can't, you can copy and
paste an ecosystem. Yeah. That has to be

299
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
built. That has to be organic or else it's
not going to work.

300
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah. So besides the cheapest, I
remember, I remember affordability. I

301
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
remember MGPi speaking about when he was
working on something where he was doing

302
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
something for Ethereum and then for
Cardano and then for Ergo. And he said

303
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
something that I always remember. He said
something like, yep, in Ergo, I did it in

304
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
a week in Cardano. It took like four
weeks. And on Ethereum, it took, you know,

305
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
like a month or two months kind of thing.
And just speaks to the like, turn around

306
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
the amount of quick time you can really
get these kind of things set up and going

307
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
on Ergo.

308
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Yeah. And again, this is one of the main
reasons why I started building this thing

309
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
on Ergo is because it was just all really
straightforward. You know, you just go

310
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
there, you figure out. I mean, it's
it's...

311
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You even started it. I remember you
starting to yourself that I remember you

312
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
sitting down. Yeah, I did. I did. You were
punching it out there for a couple of

313
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
weeks getting at the base started there.

314
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah, I did. I did. I started it because
because it's been some years when I, you

315
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
know, since I actually set down to code
and I found out that some of the

316
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
development environments I was using are
no longer used. And so I had to kind of

317
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
like, you know, I do a refresher and I'm
like, why the hell isn't this working?

318
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Like Alex is, oh yeah, they don't really
use that development environment. Okay,

319
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
well, I guess, you know, 2015 called.

320
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
But, you know, eventually, I mean, and
again, with the help of the community and

321
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
who I ended up actually hiring later on,
like for example, Luca was really helpful,

322
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
you know, from the start, explaining just
how to utilize all the different tools on

323
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Ergo. And so eventually I just said, Hey,
why don't we just have Luca work with us?

324
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And so that's how that happened. You know,
and, you know, the same thing happened. We

325
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
should share same thing happened with,
with several people that are, that are

326
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
working at ZenGate. These people came from
the community, you know, and that's

327
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
because these people were, were so helpful
in the beginning that I thought that,

328
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
yeah, I just want to keep working with
them.

329
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah. Well, that's awesome, Dan. So I
think ZenGate and other things in Ergo are

330
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
really doing what is going to make or
break blockchains, right? You know, I feel

331
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
like blockchain at this point in time,
cryptocurrency is on the teeter of have

332
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
VCs pumped and pulled and sucked enough
value out of these chains to where we're

333
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
finally hitting a point where people, as
kushti's preaching, people are sick of

334
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
these VC dumps, and they're looking for
something that actually provides value and

335
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
that can bring something to, like you say,
you say RWIs, right? You say real, what

336
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
was your term?

337
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Real world impact, that's right.

338
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah, you got it. They have real world,
but I really feel like ZenGate

339
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
accomplishes that.

340
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You know, I mean, a lot of this stuff is
noise. A lot of this stuff is noise. You

341
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
really get into it and you just realize
that there's so much noise out there in

342
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
the crypto space that you really have to
understand what really matters. And what

343
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
really matters in the end is when you
build things like this, that's why we're

344
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
in this. That's why we're building this is
because that's what makes sense. That's

345
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
what makes sense in the long term.

346
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And really those of us that got into this
movement because we saw the big picture.

347
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Sometimes we'll get distracted, you know,
and we'll think, oh, you know, it's over,

348
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
it's over because of all this, you know,
useless bullshit that's out there. And

349
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
then again, you get back to it's like,
well, no, but the core mission, the core

350
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
technology is still there. It's waiting to
be used just because it's being used in an

351
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
idiotic way doesn't mean that it
invalidates its core mission, purpose, and

352
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
possibilities.

353
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I agree, Dan. Well, anything you want to
say to Ergo or to ZenGate or to the

354
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
community before we close up here?

355
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Well, look, I'd like to wish everybody a
happy Ergoversary. Six years old, I think,

356
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
right?

357
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
2019? Something like that. Six years old,
yeah.

358
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Six years old. I'm going to be ready for
first grade soon. It's been an honor and a

359
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
privilege to be part of the community, to
be able to build a business on Ergo, to be

360
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
able to build on Ergo. I mean, I just hope
more people out there in the community

361
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
take that extra step and really start
building a business because I think that's

362
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
really what this needs.

363
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I always say that Ergo is the US Steel of
blockchains. You might not know it by

364
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
name, but a bunch of stuff that you use is
built with it. So I think that that's a

365
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
damn fine place to be in. I think that's
essentially that puts it as one of the

366
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
core building blocks of the entire
blockchain movement. And like I said, I

367
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
still strongly believe that and I hope
that others will join me and they believe

368
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
it so much that they will spend their
time, their money and their energy in

369
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,000
building a business on Ergo.

370
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Amazing well said Dan can't top that.
Thanks so much for joining us and happy

371
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
birthday Ergo Thank you very much.

372
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Yep. Happy birthday Ergo.
