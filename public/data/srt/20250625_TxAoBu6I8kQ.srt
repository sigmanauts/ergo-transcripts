00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hey everyone, R.O.B. here, bringing you
Cortex, my Ergo Hack 10 project.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Before I get into the project, I just
want to tell you a little bit about

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
myself. I was originally part of the
GetBlok team, which was a decentralized

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
smart contract-based mining pool on the
Ergo blockchain. I was launched several

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
years back and unfortunately since then,
the pool was closed.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But that project did lead to some of the
concepts and ideas behind Lithos Protocol,

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
which is another project that is currently
being developed by qx(). Aside from that,

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm a father of two. I'm a big enthusiast
of proof of work mining, specifically

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
decentralized mining, and one of the
passions that I've always had was trying

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
to find ways to decentralize mining even
further.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
As many of you know, mining software and
various points of the proof of work mining

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
process unfortunately still remain
centralized and remain either on a pool

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
host server or black box mining software
that you really don't know what's

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
happening behind the scenes. So, yeah,
always had an interest in that.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And that kind of led to some of the ideas
that were built into Cortex here.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Obviously Ergo Hack 10 is an AI-based
themed hackathon. And I had some general

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
ideas on how can you integrate AI with GPU
mining.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Some of the ideas were using AI to
basically process data, basically train a

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
model to understand stats specifically
around temperatures, overclocks, memory

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
clock settings, things of that nature. And
monitor that against mining performance to

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
really get an understanding of how those
settings may impact mining in general and

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
get a good data set and truly understand
how that data set could be utilized to

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
potentially mine more efficiently and
lower your power settings or find ways

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
just to find little tweaks and gains here
that could make mining a little bit more

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
efficient these days, right?

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So, yeah, that was kind of the original
concept behind Cortex. We'll get into how

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
the project evolved a little bit further
than that. It became overall an ambitious

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
project here, but yeah, excited to show
you what I have.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So what is Cortex? Cortex is the next
generation open source CUDA GPU miner for

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the Ergo blockchain. And it's focused on a
few different points here, but

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
transparency and audibility. So we want to
keep this open source. All the code will

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
be available on GitHub and open for
collaboration or modification.

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This was AI generated code. I did use
several different models to build the code

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
base here, but I found a lot of success
using GPT 4.1. I used some of the project

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
folder method where I loaded several files
and data points and trained the model on

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
the instructions I wanted it to use to
build the code base here.

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Within the project, we have real-time GPU
control, so we'll give you visibility to

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
your GPUs in a live monitor format. And
ultimately you can make changes or change

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
settings to your GPU. However, this is
Linux based code. So there are some

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
restrictions. Some of the lower model GPUs
have less restrictions and can be set. So

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
we're looking into that a little bit
further just to see if we can optimize

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
that.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Aside from that, we do have full stratum
and node mining support. So there is no

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
deployment built within the code. And the
original concept was to have a node and be

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
able to launch a node and mine directly to
that node.

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Unfortunately, I've been running this on
a single GPU, so finding any blocks with a

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
single GPU on mainnet would be virtually
impossible. So it did make a shift to

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
testnet, had some complications,
basically, syncing to testnet node. So had

49
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
to pivot, which we'll get into a little
bit here later in the project.

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And then AI powered mining optimization.
So as I mentioned earlier, we did find a

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
way to kind of analyze not only the GPU
stats, but some of the nonce predictions.

52
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And a nonce is basically what you're
trying to solve when you're looking for a

53
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
block in simple terms. So once you solve
the nonce or match the nonce, that's

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
solving the equation. And in turn, that's
the block solution.

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So yeah, we have some code that's built
in here that will kind of analyze that

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
data and it will build a data set. And
over time, we will train that model and it

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
will just continue to get smarter.

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So some goals that I've outlined for the
project. So again, needed to develop a

59
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
miner. I'm not a developer by any means,
so I can use some reference and there was

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
obviously the original Ergo CUDA miner.
And when we say CUDA, CUDA just means

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Nvidia. It's just basically the dataset
that gets processed.

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So I did use the original Ergo CUDA miner
as a reference, which was developed by

63
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
MHS. I trained that into the AM model to
use that code set to build a new miner

64
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
from the ground up, basically.

65
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Node deployment. So we do have node
deployment via backend through a simple

66
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
UI. The UI would be hosted locally, so it
wouldn't be like you would need to connect

67
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
to a server. And that UI can be adjusted
as needed. I just used a very simple

68
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
format just to more focus on the backend
structure.

69
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And then, as I mentioned, basic
dashboard, it does have the node control

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
as well as miner control. And it does give
you some visibility of the GPU, which can

71
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
be expanded on later.

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The original goal test net block mining
directly through the UI. Unfortunately,

73
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
due to some complications, we did have to
pivot to pool mining which had its own

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
series of complications that will get into
but yeah, well once the test net node is a

75
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
little bit more stable and fortunately
having some challenges connecting to peers

76
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and getting up to a full block height so
we can revisit that at a later time.

77
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And then ultimately what we would like to
do is as we train the model and it gets

78
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
smarter and we can set it to do an auto
GPU tuning based on the nonce prediction

79
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
or any further optimization that we may
layer into the code base. And that can be,

80
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
we find more shares if our temperature is
at X or we find more blocks if you're a

81
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
solo miner based on these settings.

82
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So it'll be interesting to see if people
can train models a little bit further than

83
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I can, and ultimately those models can be
shared and people can use those models and

84
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
it could be a kind of a community-based
tool where people can share different data

85
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
sets with each other and that may help
miners find optimizations within their own

86
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
mining farm or with their own mining rig,
so to speak.

87
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Current architecture. So try to keep it
fairly simple. We do have a backend, we

88
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
have a front end, within the backend it is
there's the node, the stratum GPU manager,

89
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and that's all built with node JS and
express. We do have a front end. It's

90
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
react, so that can be expanded on and you
can make it beautiful if you want, or keep

91
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
it very simple.

92
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And that all does have live controls that
are monitored or connected through a fast

93
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
API. And then again we built within the
CUDA miner some challenges connecting to

94
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
the pool and finding shares that we're
working on. We did have a little spike

95
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
where we were seen on the pool and the
hash rate was realized. However, working

96
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
on just the share control as we ended up
spamming the pool and get rejected

97
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
multiple times.

98
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
All right. So our node manager, so this
is just a little preview of the node

99
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
deployer that we have developed. We'll
give you a little live preview of how this

100
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
works, but in a nutshell, it does allow to
launch an Ergo node either on main net or

101
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
test net. gives you a series of the
version and you can do live configuration

102
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
control as well as have a live preview of
the node status.

103
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Miner manager. So this just gives you a
little snippet here of what that looks

104
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
like. Again, very simple UI. You basically
put in your Ergo address, your worker

105
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
name, and then there's some backend code
that would load into a configuration and

106
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
that would connect to the mining pool.

107
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Currently the code is basically
hard-coded to connect to the Sigmanauts

108
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
mining pool. You can change that at any
time by just looking at the code and

109
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
changing the IP address of the pool that
you want to connect to.

110
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So just talk a little bit further about
the miner control panel. Again, this is

111
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
connecting directly to the backend code.
So it allows you to start and stop the

112
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
miner, adjust the configuration. And then
we will have live log right here in the

113
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
UI. And that will give you all the status
updates of the accepted shares, any of the

114
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
GPU stats or any of the additional log
information that you may want to say.

115
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Again, we did have the pivot to pool
mining. So that was the focus here. We do

116
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
have some code built that does allow you
to mine directly to the node. However, we

117
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
did kind of pull that out of the backend
code for the time being until we can

118
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
connect to a testnet node.

119
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We talked about the pool integration.
Again, we did successfully connect to the

120
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Sigmanauts pool, successfully submitted a
couple of shares. Our hash rate was

121
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
realized on the pool, so we did see a true
handshake. But what we're working on is

122
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
the job parsing and share submission.

123
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And that's basically what we're working
on moving forward is live share

124
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
submission, getting a true hash
validation, and then once that is live and

125
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
true, we can connect the AI a little bit
further and get a little bit better data

126
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
than what we're seeing today as we had to
put that more into what I'll call a demo

127
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
mode.

128
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
GPU monitoring. So this is very simple.
Again, we'll show you what this looks like

129
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
in the live preview. And then the meat of
the project here is the AI integration

130
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
framework.

131
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So again, we did successfully complete a
model that does analyze real mining

132
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
information, as well as the GPU data,
share information. And then what we do is

133
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
we would store that in a JSON log. So that
information gets stored in the log. We're

134
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
using a random forest machine learning
model.

135
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And what that is, just to kind of keep it
very simple, is it is a decision tree. And

136
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
it basically takes all the information
that gets loaded into the log, and it kind

137
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
of creates a weighted average based on the
decision tree method. And then it provides

138
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
a prediction based on what it thinks that
the most predictable number, and at this

139
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
point we're using a nonce, but that can be
changed to give us visibility or

140
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
prediction into GPU settings or overclock
settings or anything that we may want to

141
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
load in there and get predictions on.

142
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
In the pipeline, again, we basically
collect all the data in the logs. At this

143
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
point in time, it's basically just stats
and share results. What we're doing is

144
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
we're actually tying that into the miner
and also bouncing it off the node just to

145
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
confirm the block height and the
difficulty that bounces it off of the GPU

146
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
stats.

147
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And what it's doing is it's telling the
miner to work on a nonce within this

148
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
range. It says 95% confidence. It's again,
mock information at this point because

149
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
we're just spamming multiple shares.
However, once we do get true mining, and I

150
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
have a feeling this will be more reliable
on a solo pool versus pool mining, but

151
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
we'll get it going and learn a little bit
more on the data set once we can get some

152
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
true data to analyze.

153
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And then progress summary. So these are
the items that we have accomplished

154
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
throughout the project. Again, very
ambitious. I think we were hoping to get a

155
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
little bit further than that. Mining
development and mining software is very

156
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
complicated and as much as AI has improved
over the years, I think there are still

157
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
some room to improve as far as just
overall blockchain development.

158
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
All right, so we successfully completed
the node manager and true Ergo node

159
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
deployment. We have a node running right
now, so we'll show you that. It's actually

160
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
stopped for the time being, so we can
basically build the code from the ground

161
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
up.

162
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Live GPU monitoring. We did get the CUDA
mining kernel development active, so we

163
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
have a true functioning miner, although
there is some issues with connecting to

164
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
the pool and submitting shares
successfully. We did successfully complete

165
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
the data-driven AI optimization, again,
built a simple UI dashboard.

166
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
We do have the live feedback loop with
live recommendations. And some of the

167
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
things that we'll still need to work on
is, again, the share submission, and then

168
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
overclocking automation. Unfortunately,
Linux is not very friendly with GPU

169
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
settings. So we'll have to maybe take a
different approach and look to offer

170
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Windows integration versus looking at
modifying the BIOS of the GPU, which could

171
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
potentially cause issues.

172
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
All right, let's get into the fun stuff.
So what we'll go through now is we will

173
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
build the code from the back end and then
we'll show you how it's running on the

174
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
front end.

175
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So again, try to keep it very simple
here. We have all of our back end code

176
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
basically in the back end and this is
really just for the dashboard

177
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
specifically. Front end again is just some
of the simple pages that we use for the

178
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
UI. And then everything else is basically
our source code, our mining software, some

179
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
of the stratum code back end for the
mining. And even the node generation is

180
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
built here in the back end. There are just
basically a few commands and a few

181
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
dependencies that you'll need to run,
which we have outlined all in the GitHub.

182
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What we'll do is we're going to run the
miner. We'll turn on the AI software or

183
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
the AI listener. And then we'll turn on
the back end for the UI where it will

184
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
bring everything together. And then we'll
launch that on the front end here.

185
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So what we'll do here is, before we get
into that, I'll just kind of show you how

186
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
the miner works in the back end. So we'll
just run that miner command. And then

187
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
again, you'll see we'll get our stratum
connection to the pool. We'll get our

188
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
subscribe and authorize. We'll understand
the difficulty of the pool, but then when

189
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
we go to look to submit shares, what was
happening is we were just spamming shares

190
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
like crazy.

191
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So I turned that off just to kind of show
a demo of what that looks like. So it will

192
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
basically freeze here. It does receive the
job, but it doesn't work on the job at

193
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
this point in time.

194
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,000
All right, so this is the AI listener. So
this is built in Python. And basically

195
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
what this will do is there's a couple
things here. So we have two services. We

196
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
have the AI service, which is basically
the API service that will connect to the

197
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
database and provide information to the
UI. And then we have the training model.

198
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What happens is we will turn on the
miner. The miner will take a bunch of

199
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
information and load it into a log. And
then we'll run the train command. The

200
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
train command will basically calculate the
weighted method based on the information

201
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
that's within the log. And that's where it
will provide its prediction.

202
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So just kind of show how that runs on the
back end, simple command here. Again, it

203
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
takes all the information for this model.
Currently, we're just using five data

204
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
points, temperature, utilization, power,
the nonce range, and difficulty. And then

205
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
it will analyze that and again, do a
weighted average and then calculate that,

206
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
calculate a score, and then that score
will kind of predict a range.

207
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Again, we're using nonce, but we can
modify this to one, extend our data out,

208
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
our data set out further to collect more
information, or we can predict different

209
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
items here, whether it's temperature range
that may be more useful for mining, power

210
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
settings, things of that nature.

211
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And then the last one's just the API
service. And we're just going to turn this

212
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
on. And again, this just connects the API
to the backend.

213
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And now we're in our backend. So
basically what our backend does, this is

214
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
a, we run a file called server JS. It's
just a simple JavaScript file. What that

215
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
does is basically ties everything
together. So within this file, we have our

216
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
node deployer, which again basically it
does a lot of pretty cool things that it

217
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
downloads the jar file from the Ergo
GitHub.

218
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You can pick the version that you want to
use. You can modify the configuration as

219
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
needed. You can start and stop the node if
you want to adjust your configuration,

220
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
which is part of the setup process. And
again, you have the option between

221
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
toggling between test net and main net.

222
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
There is a feature where you can add a
snapshot. However, I was struggling with

223
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
it. Again, I was using Testnet, so there
was just some challenges in general, even

224
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
when trying to sync from scratch. But
there is an option here. You just need to

225
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
drop your snapshot into the backend
folder, the dashboard backend folder.

226
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You'll see a folder there for snapshots,
and then that will automatically load it

227
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
into the node, and your snapshot will be
live.

228
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Also within here is the mining software.
So we'll just basically turn on and off

229
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
the miner as noted. And then we have our
GPU information tied in here that ties

230
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
into the front end as well as our AI
analyzer. And so we'll turn on the backend

231
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and again, just a simple command here in
order to warning just cause we're using an

232
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
experimental module, but it's working
well. So no worries there.

233
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:28,000
All right. And then it says that we are
running the server on the backend now. And

234
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,000
then the last thing is just to turn on the
react UI. We just use NPM start for that.

235
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
All right. We have built our front end.
All right. So again, very simple UI. We

236
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
have our mining dashboard. our node
manager, our GPU monitor and our AI

237
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
insights.

238
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So what we'll do is we're going to go
ahead and turn on our node. So I was

239
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
previously running a node. You'll see I
have it turned off because we had the

240
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
backend turned off. So what we'll do is
we'll go ahead and pick the version I was

241
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
using. This is a live download from the
GitHub, so it will always give you the

242
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
latest versions, whether it's a
pre-release or a stable version.

243
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,000
There is a just a generic configuration
in here. Obviously, feel free to modify as

244
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
needed. All right, we're going to go ahead
and we're going to paste our configuration

245
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:43,000
in here. sure we're on the right version
or on the right network and you can switch

246
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:51,000
to test that if you'd like and then we'll
just simply deploy our node.

247
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Now I just had this running so it will
catch up pretty quickly and I'm not fully

248
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
synced but again, we do have a log here.
It's scrollable, which is nice. So if you

249
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
have errors or issues, it's an issue of
node data is very fast and rapid. So

250
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
sometimes it can be hard to parse through.
So this will just give you a little bit of

251
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
a debugging tool.

252
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
If you're having challenges, setting up
your node and then we give you the status

253
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
there. And we do just have kind of simple
checklists here of what you need to do

254
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
once you get the node running. Again, you
could stop the node as needed, edit your

255
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
configuration, and then you just hit
deploy to rerun it.

256
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And then if you need more help, you can
go to the Ergo Platform Official

257
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Documentation. All right, we'll flip over,
see if our node is running. We are, we're

258
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
connecting to some peers, getting up to
height. So yeah, node is syncing.

259
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
All right, next we'll go to the mining
dashboard. So again, in a very simple

260
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
format. We'll go ahead here and we'll
paste in our address, our worker name. And

261
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
then you can save the configuration. If
you look in the back end, this is just a

262
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
simple configuration file. I think it's
named config. Again, you can look in that.

263
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And again, if you need to modify it based
on pool format, you can go ahead and do so

264
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
as needed.

265
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
But this is set up again. We're set up
hard-coded to connect to the Sigmanauts

266
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
mining pool. And then what we'll do is
we'll start Miner, and you'll see

267
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
basically what you saw on the back end
there. So yeah, that's that. Again, it's

268
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
not live mining at this point. Again, we
did turn off the share submission just so

269
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
we're not spamming the pool and getting
kicked off for the demo purpose.

270
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
More to come as we build this out. We
have a live GPU monitor here. We're not

271
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
utilizing it very much, so you'll see it
will kind of just bounce up just based on

272
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
what I'm displaying here. So not under
full load. We did test under full load and

273
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
it does work accordingly. It does give you
live information. Again, I'm in idle mode,

274
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
so my fans aren't even on. It's nice and
cool, so no need to go there.

275
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Power settings can be adjusted. Fan speed
can be adjusted. I did have success with

276
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
the 1080. I was having some other
challenges just because it was an older

277
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
GPU, so I did pull that out and throw my
3060 in here. But for whatever reason,

278
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Linux just has some challenges running it
without X display. And that was just a

279
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
whole other path that I just didn't want
to go down and add further complication to

280
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
the project.

281
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So we did get the monitor working. We
were able to make some setting adjustments

282
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
to the GPU. And this can be built out
further. And we do have access to

283
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
overclock settings as well. But if we
wanted to do anything a little bit deeper

284
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
with the GPU. There's a whole series of
settings available in the NVIDIA settings

285
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
command as well as NVIDIA SMI.

286
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And then last but not least our AI
insights page. So right now this is just

287
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
running off of really what's driving the
data change is the adjustment and

288
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
temperature utilization and power. There's
a very limited data set right now. So it's

289
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
just gonna throw a bunch of random numbers
out there the more data that gets

290
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
collected and analyzed the more accurate
this may be but again with the variability

291
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
in nonce just in general with
proof-of-work mining and I don't think

292
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
that that may be a direction to go in.

293
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I think where the power of this tool
could be is really just around some of

294
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,000
your GPU settings. And again, going back
to the original goal of the project, how

295
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,000
can you kind of reduce overall utilization
of your GPU and potentially mine a little

296
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,000
bit more efficiently, just obviously with
inflation. Deflation of proof-of-work

297
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,000
mining coins, every little advantage that
you can get in mining all the better.

298
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
All right. Well, I wanted to thank you
for watching my presentation of Cortex.

299
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Something that I do again have a lot of
passion behind and something that

300
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
personally I think I'll continue to build
out slowly. It's obviously something that

301
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
requires resourcing and things of that
nature.

302
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But again, the code is free and open. It
can be found on my GitHub, which I have

303
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
the link here. We'd love any potential
collaboration on how we could potentially

304
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
expand on this project. Again, the purpose
was for it to be community-driven and the

305
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
more people that could get involved and
potentially drive some different ideas and

306
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
concepts and know-how in the mining space
could potentially bring this project to

307
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
life.

308
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Thanks again. Take care.
