1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Good morning, Ergo community.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Excuse me, got a frog in my throat over
there.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Welcome to the 10th, 11th consecutive
community AMA, hosted by anybody who wants

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to join and talk.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Today we have kushti, Richi, and Grayman.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's good to see you guys. How you doing?

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Doing well, doing well. How about you?

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hanging in there, a little sleepy, but
otherwise hanging in there.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Grayman was about to say hi too, Grayman.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm alive.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We here in the U.S. are suffering from
some crazy made-up time scheme called

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
daylight savings time. So it's 8 o'clock
for us in the morning as opposed to 9

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
o'clock, which doesn't seem like it makes
a difference, but it makes a big

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
difference on the first couple of days
when you're all thrown about.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's better than losing an hour honestly.
But it is what it is. We fall back and we

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
spring ahead, is the term. Lose an hour in
the spring, gain an hour in the fall.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What new things are happening in the
ecosystem, guys?

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So a lot of, starting from
infrastructure, there's going to be more

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and more talks about AI, right, in
different aspects. Quite natural because,

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
well, Ergo is GPU minable, right, so,
well, a lot of intersections with AI

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
inference.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Here, then, I also believe that currently
payments in AI are mostly corporate owned,

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,000
right? And it's not quite acceptable. And
actually, I believe we have a lot of

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
solutions here because, well, after all,
the Ergo community is working on

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,000
programmable money for many years and a
lot of useful solutions for the AI space.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And, well, having a lot of talks with
different developers around the community.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Unfortunately, most are not so public, so
I believe, well, if we are going to act as

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
an open source money movement, then there
is need to communicate publicly, right?

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Express ideas, get feedback and store all
those things in logs because some things

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
are actually revived a few years after,
right, and getting implemented.

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So, well, everything is quite useful
here. Well, most of information, I

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
believe.

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We even have an AI game coming up this
weekend. Tim Erg's AI game Sigma Quest

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
starts this weekend, Sunday morning.

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh, what is that? Can you elaborate on
what that is, Grayman?

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't know fully. I wish he were here
to explain it because he'd do a better

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
job. But in essence, it's sort of a
scavenger hunt type deal where you solve

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
three problems, probably with the help of
AI.

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And if you manage to solve them for each
one, you get a few of the keywords from an

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
ergo wallet that currently contains 200
ERG, but everybody who participates has to

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
kick in 20 ERG, 15 of which goes into the
pot.

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So if you got 10 people playing, you
could stand to win 350 ERG, which is not a

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
small amount of money, so worth it if
you're in the mood to have some fun.

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Essentially, it's not like Game of
Prompts, but it's similar. I think you

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
have to solve these problems in order to
win. There was something sort of game

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
theory-ish about how it worked, because if
you got one of them and not the others,

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
then you had an advantage. And you could
share with other players. You could share

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
your seed phrase in order to leapfrog to
the win.

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But I have to read the rules again before
it starts. It's on Sunday, if anybody's

50
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
interested.

51
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm looking at it right now. There's a
couple of different ones. There's yes-no,

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
oracle version, narrative escape version,
sigma-not-guardian version. I see yes-no

53
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
version is dealing with an AI that is
damaged and can only respond yes or no to

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
your questions. That's pretty neat.

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
90% goes to the community pot prize, 10%
goes to the project treasury. Each

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
completed guardian rewards players with
five seed phrases. Oh, so there's three

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
guardians. So yes, no, oracle, the
narrative escape, and the sigma knot

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
guardian.

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This is pretty cool. Did he start this in
the last Ergo hack? Was that what this is?

60
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes. And unfortunately, he was right
about to release it. And it turns out that

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
he discovered that there were some ways to
kind of cheat it. And so he called it off

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and said, let me get my hack together.

63
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And so he regrouped. I think Tim, like
everybody else in the Ergo ecosystem, has

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
his own job and his own life, which is,
we're a collection of interesting people,

65
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
not VC funded with a team of five coders
and then a bunch of Red Bulls and pizzas

66
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and trying to knock out solutions for the
VC if they crack a whip.

67
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's not our go. So he's got his own
life. It took him a couple of months to

68
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
get it back up and running, but here we
are.

69
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He's using Lovable, I think, AI to help
him write it. I just put the link to the

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Ergo website where they have an article on
this game in chat if people want to see

71
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
that. But it looks pretty fun.

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I remember the fun puzzle games that
Maverick used to do. Those are really

73
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
incredible and fun and well thought out.
I've seen Maverick pop up in chat

74
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
recently.

75
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah, I did. Yeah, that guy's cool. He's
also somebody who's, his real life sort of

76
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
interrupted for a while. But he poked his
head up again in chat recently, said he's

77
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
doing great.

78
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh, we got somebody in the waiting room.
Let's see if this person's a spammer.

79
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We'll give it a try. Yeah, what else
happened this week?

80
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We had a good kind of choke this week
about, for those of you who don't know,

81
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
some of our infrastructure is on Hetzner,
and historically it's been paid for by the

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
EF, and there was a billing issue midweek
or end of last week. They went down, which

83
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
shouldn't be a problem because we
literally have like eight other backup

84
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
explorers kicking around.

85
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And if you saw chats, you saw that I
posted all those APIs and GraphQLs and

86
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Explorer endpoints in chat in hopes that
in the future, dApps will just use a

87
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
rollover technique if they can't reach one
explorer to go to the other.

88
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But that was interesting to see the choke
points, right? Because we witnessed a

89
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
choke point from Amazon and Microsoft a
couple weeks ago as well. But I think we

90
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
can be completely resilient to that kind
of stuff, right?

91
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Eventually, so the way the infrastructure
is going to work, hopefully, is that there

92
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
will still be a choke point at CloudFlare
load balancer, right? The DNS has to point

93
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
to somewhere to go and then load balance
to the 10, 11, 12, exploring instances

94
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
that are out there across the globe.

95
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So the way around that as well is create
unique IDs for each one of those load

96
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
balance endpoints. So that while we can't,
if we're going to rely on Cloudflare for

97
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
the load balancer or some other single
load point for the load balancer, at least

98
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
dApps can build in the individual load
balance machines as well.

99
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So if a dApp tries to hit the load
balancer first for a user and goes

100
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
geographically to the right location
nearest the person for the best speed, if

101
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
that doesn't work because Cloudflare is
down, then it'll just roll over to one of

102
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
the load balancers directly and have
direct access to it.

103
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So that's a hope there, that we're
completely impervious to that kind of

104
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
outage, those centralized outages.

105
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
We've got, as I said last week, those
three machines shipped out. And I think

106
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
two of the people got them. Maybe all
three did. They'll be syncing their nodes.

107
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Once that happens, there is some database
optimizations we have to do to them all at

108
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
once so that there are a couple of queries
that are really database intensive and

109
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
fail if the database hasn't been optimized
in a certain way.

110
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So once that's done and we do those tests
and make sure it's good, then either we

111
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
repoint the Ergo platform explorers
through the peer-to-peer network, kind of

112
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
like we did this week for a little bit to
test, and then we burn them down. And we

113
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
stop that $700 a month drain to pay for
those things. And the community takes it

114
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
over which I think is absolutely amazing
and how it should be, right?

115
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Grayman, you were talking about joining
the network as well weren't you at some

116
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
point?

117
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I can't use one of my customers fiber
lines for this purpose. I'd have to get my

118
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
own and I live out in the county. So it's
coming my way. But apparently the company

119
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
that was going to roll it out here got
bought out by T-Mobile. So God knows how

120
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
long it's going to take.

121
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You don't want to run a node off a cell
connection?

122
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's cable, but it's asymmetric. So the
upload speed is just too slow to support.

123
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I don't want to join and be a worthless
limping piece.

124
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
At least the way Cloudflare works,
Grayman, is we can weight you a little

125
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
bit. So if we have a geographic location
and you're sharing it in the US with, it's

126
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
going to be five or six other people, we
can actually give you a weighted average

127
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
of how many times people hit you so that
you're not equally hit as many as other

128
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
people.

129
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So if I'm on, the three here that I have
are on a 10 gigabit connection

130
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
asymmetrical, so I can give myself more
weight as opposed to you. I can give you

131
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
10% of the weight of the pool so that
you're not hit as much. So to the user,

132
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
it's going to feel the same, right?
Because not being crowded or jumped up.

133
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So think about it, Grayman, if you want
to do it.

134
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I am an old school IT guy. For the last
five years, that's mostly about migrating

135
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
people to the cloud.

136
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Now you're coming home, Grayman, you're
coming home.

137
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I miss the good old days. So maybe I'm
helping you.

138
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
All right, sweet. I think in the
corporate environment here or the

139
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
educational environment, there's been a
big push, I'd say, in the last, well, I've

140
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
been here 17, 18 years at Cornell. There's
been a big push to make everything easier

141
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
by going to the cloud, right? And I fought
it since the beginning simply because it's

142
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
used as an excuse to drain the most
important thing from the institution and

143
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
that's institutional knowledge, right?

144
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If you can pay Microsoft to run your
mail, why do you need two mail experts on

145
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
staff here, right? You can fire them and
you can hire somebody at 30, 40, $50,000

146
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
that just pushes buttons and calls
Microsoft support when they need help,

147
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
right?

148
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But if they were running an exchange
server before, it's not like this is holy

149
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
knowledge to know how to run Exchange
2013.

150
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I love that that shit's outsourced. God,
I hate it. SharePoint was the worst, and

151
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
now that's somebody else's problem.

152
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
True, but it makes a huge hole in that.
And maybe exchange was a bad example for

153
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
that. But I understand that. But it goes
for many other things as well. A lot of

154
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
expertise has dropped.

155
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
There was an article one day about 15, 16
years ago from somebody in the education

156
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
training department here at Cornell and
the article literally was we do not need

157
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
IT people on staff anymore at Cornell
because we just need IT architects and the

158
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
way they described that was people who
they could bring in that knew how to

159
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
design and call Dell and something breaks,
send it to Dell or get a Dell parts locker

160
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
here or ship it over here or set this up.

161
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So sure, it's another method, but again,
it's an institutional drain. And actually,

162
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I think that person's now CIO of some
college somewhere, unfortunately.

163
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But back to the cloud computing idea.
Cloud computing really enables that for

164
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
corporate and educational institutions.
And I don't embrace that for most things.

165
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I think if we can build things to an open
framework that is shareable and we design

166
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
things that can be designed well enough to
where if somebody from another department

167
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
says, hey, I like what you're doing there.
It's really cool. Can we share it?

168
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And I click a button because I've already
designed it in the framework that's

169
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
shareable like that. Or I say, yeah,
here's my git, go for it, do what you

170
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
need. And maybe they make something better
than me and I come back and I clone their

171
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
repository and go from that kind of thing.

172
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So that's my belief that expertise and
things like that should stay local.

173
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Exactly like we saw when two weeks ago
when Amazon went out and Solana and those

174
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
chains are scrambling and shitting their
pants because it's another sample of just

175
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
in time inventory.

176
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's just the way that things are done in
the modern world. And it is fragile, but

177
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
it's effective. I mean, and it's a
nuisance when something goes wrong because

178
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
nobody that's in the chain of solution has
any idea what they're doing aside from

179
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
their little part of the chain.

180
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So coming from the old world and having
to troubleshoot this stuff, which is what

181
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I do all the time, because I'm where the
rubber meets the road at the end user at

182
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
the client level. And so it's solving all
these weird problems.

183
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And the tools that I have are not reading
the manual or futzing with stuff and

184
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
trying to fix it on a test server. It's
just patience and knowing what to Google

185
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and talking nicely to this person in the
chain who is part of the solution and all

186
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
those types of stuff.

187
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's turned my job into a touchy-feely
thing that I hate, which is why I'm here

188
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
in Ergo. And so maybe it's not
coincidental that I'm interested in going

189
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
back to peer-to-peer and local solutions
as opposed to this. Maybe it's my

190
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
subconscious is telling me that I want to
escape my corporate job.

191
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That could be. Yeah, I mean, think about
scaling, right? If you want to spread

192
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
yourself like with a chain that requires
cloud infrastructure, think about the cost

193
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
of spreading your assets over Amazon, over
Microsoft, over some other cloud provider,

194
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
hoping that there's not some choke point
in between that they both use, right?

195
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So the cost there versus scaling it over
a system of peer-to-peer users who built

196
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
the nodes themselves so they know how they
function, they know how to spin things up

197
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
and down, and they know hopefully why
things break, and the redundancy there. I

198
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
think that speaks for itself in times like
a couple weeks ago with the great crash of

199
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
AWS.

200
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So it's really excited about that.
That'll be really good to be able to boast

201
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
that kind of thing that all our main
infrastructure is held by the peers that

202
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
are part of the network. So that'll be a
good bragging point.

203
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Infrastructure-wise, we need to do some
maintenance work and bug fix for Explorer.

204
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Well, the first pull request just got in
the Explorer backend repository.

205
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Also, we are looking for maintainers of
Ergo Wallet. I believe for now it makes

206
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
sense to update Android SDK and so on and
publish new versions of Ergo Wallet at

207
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
least.

208
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Then we will consider what wallets of
future should be like, right, especially

209
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
in the presence of AI agents which can
make with certain things.

210
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So, well, for humans, it's not so
convenient to have and to operate with

211
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:33,000
hundreds of tokens in your wallet, right?
But for AI agents, it's kind of trivial.

212
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So, well, money for AI systems could be
done very differently from what we have

213
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:55,000
now, and it could lead to more efficient
economic interactions.

214
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Then I need to think with MHS monitor our
team, right? Maybe we can find ways to

215
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:28,000
publish that mobile wallets also. Right,
because it's quite amazing. It's

216
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:43,000
supporting multi-sig, right, and so on. So
it makes sense maybe to add multi-sig

217
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:58,000
support to ergo wallet as well but we also
need to publish monitor, I believe.

218
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah, that was supposed to come out of
the mobile soon, I think.

219
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Those are two important infrastructure
pieces, right? So I'll explore on the

220
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
wallets.

221
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And, well, I'm also in talks with
different, well, guys, teams, circles and

222
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
so on. Well, with Grayman and Thomas on
real-world assets tokenization. Quite

223
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
specific and not like what most of
so-called crypto industry is doing, right?

224
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So for chain cache basis, I'm still
testing and polishing things with white

225
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
coding, now small step. But I think, well,
some things can be announced in coming

226
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
days.

227
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And for sub blocks. We are going to
launch Dev Nets in a few days, now bigger.

228
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Now we have some contributors with
Raspberry Pis. Well, we have a few people

229
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
from different continents, so it will be
quite funny. And well, from that, we can

230
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
plan further.

231
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What to do after white paper release and
welcoming to discussions, right? So a lot

232
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:37,000
of things going on in parallel and it's
November and Richi has plans also for the

233
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,000
USE DexUSD stablecoin launch.

234
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So Richi, what are the current plans?

235
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yeah, hello. Can you hear me? Yeah, thank
you. So the current plans are to have a

236
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:12,000
large event called CLB, which was
presented in Ergo Hack 9.

237
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So as long as we sort out the technical
part, and we understand that there will be

238
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
no basically delays launching the coin or
maybe we can even mint some coins but just

239
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
don't activate the smart contract or don't
activate the off-chain part whatever just

240
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
waiting for the initial bootstrap event.

241
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:48,000
So as soon as we know this we will start
probably two weeks marketing campaign. And

242
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:56,000
then we will go into a so-called CLB
community liquidity bootstrap event, which

243
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:04,000
will offer people to participate with the
ERG on ERGO as well as rsERG on Cardano.

244
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And in exchange they will be getting CLB
tokens as well as some other airdrops,

245
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
bonus airdrops, but the main one they will
be getting CLB token.

246
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
In total I plan to have only 100 CLB
tokens minted with nine decimals, so it

247
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
will be 100 CLB tokens minted with nine
decimals and it will be distributed

248
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
proportionally to everyone who contributes
their ERGs to the initial bootstrap of

249
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
liquidity pool.

250
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So, as an example, if you contributed 100
ERGs and total overall contribution is

251
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:57,000
10,000 ERGs, right, to bootstrap the pool.
I'm sure there will be more, but just as

252
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:05,000
an example. Then your part is 1% and you
will get one CLB token airdropped to you.

253
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What CLB token means it will represent
your part in the liquidity pool. So after

254
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
that all liquidity collected will be used
to start the USE liquidity pool, initial

255
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
pool, bank.

256
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So half of the ERGs collected will go to
bank reserves, and another half will be

257
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
collected, will be connected with the
liquidity of the minted tokens. And that

258
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
liquidity tokens that will be created will
be locked for two years. And instead, you

259
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
will get the CLB representation.

260
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It may sound confusing if you're not
familiar with how the system works. But

261
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
basically the whole idea is to have a big
pool of liquidity locked for two years and

262
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
then reward people who participated in the
bootstrap with the so-called

263
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
representation token.

264
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Now that CLB token can be traded on Ergo
DEXes. So like I said, there will be only

265
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
100 tokens created and each token will
represent 1% of the liquidity pool. So

266
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
these tokens will be traded on Ergo DEXes.

267
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
So they will have value. And after two
years, the smart contract, redeemed smart

268
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
contract will start working. So if after
two years, you own CLB token, you will be

269
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
able to redeem liquidity from USE ERG
liquidity pool.

270
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So with this approach, what we're trying
to achieve is we're trying to bootstrap

271
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
liquidity initially. That's very important
to have lots of liquidity from the start

272
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
of that stable coin. And because of that,
our free mint and arbitrage mint and all

273
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
the bank actions will work nicely.

274
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So people will launch economics and
things like that on top of that. So I

275
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
don't know if people who are familiar with
this might understand what I was trying to

276
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
describe. People who are hearing this for
the first time may be confused.

277
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
But we will be talking more about it and
we'll be talking more about how to launch.

278
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And I already started the white paper, so
I will publish it about the CLB and the

279
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
event. And also on Twitter, there will be
more announcements.

280
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So, but at the moment what we are waiting
is for kushti to tell us a go ahead saying

281
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
that yes, all the technical part is clear
and we are basically on a finish line to

282
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
launch this protocol.

283
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
What will be the order of magnitude of
the amount of ERG that is required to be

284
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
part of these liquidity provisions to get
one of these tokens?

285
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Right, so there will always be 100
tokens. It depends how many are collected.

286
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm just saying, what are you shooting
for? If there's 100 tokens, are you

287
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
looking for 100,000 ERG? Do you need
10,000 per person?

288
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Everyone will get proportionally to the
contribution. There are only 100 tokens,

289
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
but they have nine decimals. So if your
contribution part is very small, you will

290
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
get 0.0 something of this token, but it
will be your representation part.

291
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So my goal would be to collect around
300,000 to 400,000. So one token will be

292
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,000
worth, so you can just divide it by 100,
right? So if we collect 300,000 ERGs, so

293
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,000
one token would be worth 3,000, right? So
3,000 ERGs would be one token. And you

294
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
will get proportionately to your part of
that overall contribution.

295
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I hope that answers the question.

296
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Yeah, I guess really what I was just
asking is, what is the order of magnitude

297
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
of the initial bootstrap liquidity? So
you're saying that you have to part with

298
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
3,000 ERGs, and two years later, you can
then draw them out of this. So what is my

299
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
incentive? Do I make additional earnings
on these tokens if I get one of these?

300
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Yes, that's a good question. So what you
will get if you participate? So first of

301
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
all, you will get CLB token, which will be
representing your part of your

302
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
contribution. Anyway, after that, you'll
get some airdrops from our partners

303
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
additional as a bonus.

304
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And then your liquidity pool is
bootstrapped with 0.3% fee. So during

305
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
these two years, all the fees will be
accumulated for all the people who will be

306
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
trading USE tokens with ERGs back and
forth, right? And I hope there will be

307
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
lots of trading going on in that pool.

308
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
All that fee will be accumulated and then
after two years, you will be able to

309
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:40,000
withdraw your part of liquidity with your
CLB token with all the collected fees as

310
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,000
well as all the airdrop bonuses that you
will get in the stock, right?

311
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Now, if you don't want to wait two years,
you need something early. There will be a

312
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
secondary market for CLB tokens. I'm sure
a lot of people will want to buy those

313
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
tokens cheap and sell them high because
they clearly have the value. So each token

314
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
has a clear value because it's connected
to your liquidity pool.

315
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So people will be trading it on the
MewFinance Spectrum on all our DEXes. And

316
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
yes, it will have a value. So if you don't
want to wait, you just contribute, you

317
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
collect your bonus airdrop, and after
that, you sell your CLB token on the

318
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
secondary market. And then there
definitely will be people who will want to

319
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
buy it. You don't need to wait.

320
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Or you can hold it. Or if you think there
is lots of potential, and then there will

321
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
be lots of fees accumulated, you can buy
it from the secondary market as well, the

322
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
CLB tokens, as much as possible. And that
your part in the liquidity pool will grow

323
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
with it.

324
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I hope that sounds clear.

325
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So after two years, what happens? These
tokens still exist and you still get

326
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
rewards based on them? I'm still not
getting it. What's my incentive to be one

327
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
of the initial liquidity providers if I
can just buy these tokens on the secondary

328
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
market in one and a half years?

329
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
What unlocks in that second year if
there's a secondary? What am I getting? I

330
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
still don't get it. What happens after the
second year?

331
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So after the second year, when you
construct liquidity, you get liquidity

332
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
tokens like LP tokens. These LP tokens
will be locked in a redeemed smart

333
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
contract with CLB tokens for two years.

334
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So after two years, the smart contract
will unlock the redeem function. So you

335
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
will be able to exchange your CLB token to
liquidity token and after that,

336
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
conventionally remove liquidity from
liquidity pool. Okay? So with all the fees

337
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
accumulated.

338
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Now, if you participate in the initial
liquidity bootstrap rather than buying on

339
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,000
the secondary market, you will get some
bonus airdrops, which at the moment we

340
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:22,000
expect to be about between 5 to 10% of the
value of your contribution.

341
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And is that just done by like a database
that you have a list of wallets that

342
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
contributed and ignores the tokens that
are in people's wallets that they might

343
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
have purchased from the secondary market?

344
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Well, people can purchase tokens from the
secondary market. It means someone sold

345
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
it. Did they get the air drops?

346
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Yes, so if you contribute ERGs during the
initial bootstrap, you will get Airdrop

347
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
and the CLB token. After that, CLB token
will be traded on the secondary market.

348
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So if you want to buy it on the secondary
market, obviously you buy it as usual

349
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
token, right? Nothing different. Also, if
you want to sell, if you can sell your CLB

350
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
tokens straight away as well as sell all
your airdrop tokens, and then possibly you

351
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
can even make like quick money on it.

352
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So possibly there will be like, you will
probably make a little bit of money if you

353
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
just sell CLB tokens straight away on the
secondary market as well as all your

354
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
airdrops, because airdrops are meant to
cover between 5% and 10% of your

355
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
contribution.

356
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So I'm too dumb to chase quick profits.
But I do wonder, like, so after the two

357
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
years are up, then this thing unlocks. And
at that point, is there any purpose left

358
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
to these original tokens? Or does
everything just become normal liquidity

359
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
provisions in the DEX?

360
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
No, these tokens, so this contract will
exist forever, right? The redemption

361
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
contract. So you can redeem the portion of
liquidity pool of liquidity tokens and

362
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
then redeem liquidity or you just can keep
these tokens in your wallet for 10 years

363
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
and just accumulate fees.

364
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Your LP tokens will be locked in the
original USE LP liquidity pool and they

365
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
will stay there until you decide to redeem
them. So it's essentially like keeping

366
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
liquidity tokens in your wallet as long as
you want.

367
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That's some good questions, Grayman, and
I hope people who will be listening to

368
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
this podcast will start digging into it
more.

369
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Actually, I think maybe it makes sense to
have Twitter spaces next week, and

370
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:05,000
specifically about the USE launch, and so
on, the Dexy design, because still, I

371
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:14,000
believe, many people don't quite follow
even the basics, right, and so on.

372
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And during the week, well, we can promote
Dexy Gold, right, so people will have a

373
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
chance to play with the protocol, then ask
questions and so on. How does it sound,

374
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Richi?

375
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So next week is busy because we have a
Cardano Summit and then some traveling.

376
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I see, maybe in two weeks then. So closer
to launch and next week maybe we can do

377
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:53,000
spaces on basis changes, all that stuff,
so there is need to provide updates and

378
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:01,000
some digestible forms.

379
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:12,000
The recent weeks I am mostly just coding
and providing short updates. I think after

380
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:21,000
some more polishing and testing it makes
sense to provide more details on the

381
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:30,000
protocol, answer questions, and promoted
around, well, people interested in, well,

382
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:39,000
local payment systems as well as, well,
payment systems for AI.

383
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
For peer-to-peer payments now, quite big
topic and so on, right? So it's quite a

384
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
big trend now. Let's ride on it.

385
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Yeah, sounds good.

386
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Richi, somebody in the chat says, what's
the hardest part of launch right now and

387
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
how can they help?

388
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:11,000
So, launch will be done with MewFinance.
So, we already, actually, since ErgoHack

389
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:18,000
9, it's almost one year since we did this
presentation, ErgoHack 9, I encourage

390
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,000
everyone to go and just go to Ergo YouTube
channel, and look at the ErgoHack 9. I

391
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,000
explain how this launch will work. The
video is there.

392
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And I'll be publishing more papers on
that. So the basis is already done,

393
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:48,000
everything for the launch. So, actually,
it's not much needed. How it will look,

394
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
you will see some UI. I can probably share
some UI how it will look, but it will be

395
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:02,000
similar to the other token launch paths
that they have.

396
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Yes, when you look into MewFinance, you
will need, if you are contributing with

397
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
original ergo on ergo blockchain, you will
just need to leave your ergo wallet from

398
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
which one you will be doing the payment.

399
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
You will contribute your ERG, you will
transfer your ERG and then after that you

400
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
will immediately see how much ERG you
contributed and total ERG contributed so

401
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
you will know your share.

402
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
After two days, so I plan to run it for
three days, after three days we will

403
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
basically the final number will be known
and you will get your contribution part.

404
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So for example 1%, 1.234% and you will get
CLB tokens as well as some other sponsored

405
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
tokens airdropped to your wallet.

406
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And after that the secondary market will
be created and then you can trade this CLB

407
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
in a secondary market or hold it as well
as just enjoy the small little bonus.

408
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,000
How can you help at the moment? Just
attend spaces and subscribe to my Twitter,

409
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:29,000
USE Twitter account. So it's there. I'll
be posting some updates with my USE

410
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:36,000
account on Twitter, specifically dedicated
to this stable coin.

411
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And just follow up on the news and you
will not miss this event. I think it will

412
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
be quite interesting. It's very novel to
current DeFi.

413
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Actually, let me tell you a little bit.
Let's spend a couple of minutes talking

414
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
about USE and it's very novel and it's
trying to solve very big problems in the

415
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
current DeFi.

416
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
All stable coins that we have are
basically centralized, right? There are no

417
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
decentralized tokens. There are some kind
of attempts like Athena, but their

418
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
resources are also centralized.

419
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,000
So USE or Dexy has very unique design and
it's a lot of great minds behind it from

420
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
design perspective, as well as from trying
to build the trading experience and

421
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
launch, et cetera.

422
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
It will be working with Rosen. We will be
working with Rosen to make sure that the

423
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
distribution of this stablecoin is as wide
as possible. And as you could have

424
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
guessed, the launch itself, the CLB event
is also quite unique in DeFi space.

425
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So what we're trying to do is not just
copy paste something that's going on on

426
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Ethereum, but create something really
unique and sometimes unique DeFi.

427
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
If this project succeeds, obviously,
there will be so much recognition to Ergo

428
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
and I'll be doing everything possible to
get us there. Because all this technology,

429
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
we were talking for years about the great
technology and all our first principles

430
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
and P2P finance and things like that.

431
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
But for most of the world, what do they
see? They see us on a coin market cap. And

432
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
that's all. And they don't know about our
products. Maybe some people know about

433
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Rosen. But mostly, that's it, right?

434
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And we're trying to reach a wide
audience. Because for people, having

435
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
stable coin is very clear. You understand
what stable coin is, right? Okay, so you

436
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
know, okay, this coin is $1. That's all I
need to know. I'm not interested if ERG's

437
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
price goes to 10 or 0.1. I know that this
stablecoin is always $1.

438
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And I'm interested in it because I use
the dollars daily, right? So with that, I

439
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,000
am trying to capture a big audience and
lots of eyes are looking to Ergo because,

440
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,000
like I said, the technology is very unique
that we have. We have great minds. We just

441
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,000
need a little bit more recognition and
then more attention.

442
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Very interesting, Richi. I'm looking
forward to the launch.

443
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:40,000
From what I've heard, I think it makes
sense if you are non-dev and willing to

444
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,000
help maybe to watch those ErgoHack
presentations, right, and make some

445
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:54,000
simpler versions like a one-pager and so
on, right, so could be doable with manual

446
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,000
recheck by some dev.

447
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Well, they I also I don't like that much,
but okay. So, well, I think, well, a lot

448
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:26,000
of help could be there, right, and in the
space of doing more and more materials.

449
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So back in the days of SigmaUSD launch,
the community did some amazing job by

450
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:47,000
promoting, doing one-pagers all those
things and promoting them.

451
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:55,000
One comment if you allow me on that. So I
actually really like Ergo community and I

452
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:02,000
see how they're trying to promote it. I
like the initiative that people starting

453
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,000
with bootstrapping liquidity on Binance
chain, on Ethereum, trying to do

454
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:16,000
something.

455
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And how we collected ergs for MC, it was
amazing. So what I'm trying to say is ergo

456
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
has a very nice community and people do
participate. Even for free, they just

457
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
donate.

458
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Now, CLB will not be a donation. You will
actually make money with it. But people

459
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
are willing to donate. What we need in
their case is a little bit more

460
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
coordination and more like coordinated
effort.

461
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And I think we can go a long way with it.
So I hope the launch of this stable coin

462
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
will be like a coordinated effort where
all the community can pick it up. And we

463
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
may see some amazing results with it.

464
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
There are still lots of plans. I have a
very, very long roadmap. I cannot say

465
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
everything now. Let's go step by step. But
let's start with the successful launch,

466
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
both from technical point of view and the
initial bootstrap. But there will be lots

467
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
of amazing things coming up down the road.

468
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So we're here to shake the space. So stay
tuned.

469
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Pretty much agree. So, well, for
coordination, we are discussing this all

470
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:48,000
the time, right? We are trying different
things. So, well, with many new faces now

471
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:57,000
joining the community. Well, there is need
always, I guess, to reconsider and

472
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:06,000
reshuffle some things, right? Not to be
like some old, I don't know, bureaucratic

473
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:15,000
kind of a rotten kind of environment.

474
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
There was a question on YouTube about
privacy from Mohit Tanwar. He says, as far

475
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
as privacy coins are concerned, almost
every privacy coin is booming. What's

476
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
wrong with ergo? When will we see the
booming price action in ergo? I know we

477
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
aren't supposed to talk about price, but I
do think it makes sense to talk about

478
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
privacy.

479
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And it's true that privacy coins like
Zcash and Ergo, for that matter, yesterday

480
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
was trending on CoinGecko right along with
Zcash. But it does seem like our narrative

481
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
around privacy is different than the one
that is currently capturing the attention

482
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
of the market.

483
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And you were talking about this a little
bit, I think, yesterday on Telegram. So I

484
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:17,000
figured that'd be a good way to prompt you
with a question.

485
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I mean, my take on privacy in Ergo is
that it's at the app layer. I mean, it is

486
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
built into the core, into ErgoScript.
There's privacy tooling, and you can

487
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
certainly talk much more in depth about
that than I can.

488
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,000
But that it's good that it's optional,
because that means that if there's

489
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,000
optional privacy, that's optional
transparency as well. And so to the extent

490
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,000
that we're going to use Ergo for public
money systems, that transparency is very

491
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
important.

492
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,000
But eventually at the business layer, of
course, people want privacy. I don't want

493
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,000
my competitors to see how I spend my
money, where and when. I'm happy to report

494
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,000
my taxes to the IRS if that's what we have
to do for the last 100 plus years in

495
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
America, even though I wonder about how
that jives with the Fifth Amendment.

496
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Nevertheless, I don't want my taxes that
I report to the IRS and all of that

497
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
transaction to be open on chain for
everybody to see. I do want privacy. I

498
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
appreciate optional privacy.

499
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
But at the same time, to even have an IRS
or a government money system, you need to

500
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
have transparency. Otherwise, you end up
with the worst examples of the Cantillon

501
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
effect and all these backroom deals, and
you get right back to the system that we

502
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
have right now.

503
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,000
It's important that Bitcoin was
transparent. It's not a flaw. It may be a

504
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
limitation, but it's not a flaw. It was
important. It would not be where it is

505
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
right now had it been Monero and
completely opaque, in my opinion. What do

506
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
you think?

507
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:23,000
So in many cases it's transparency,
right? What does matter? Especially we are

508
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:32,000
talking about blockchain. So all those
talks are quite strange. So well, it's at

509
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:41,000
the same time people praise blockchain for
transparency, right?

510
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Then, well, there is need for privacy for
money. So I think, well, if we consider

511
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:58,000
blockchain as kind of a layer for reserves
mostly, right, so kind of digital

512
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:06,000
commodities then, well, in most cases
probably it should be transparent, right,

513
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:14,000
even then you need to privacy on cash
layer so basically something like basis,

514
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:22,000
right, so the privacy maybe even enforced
should be considered on the base layer.

515
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So we have optional privacy, actually a
lot of tooling, so native support for

516
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
thresholds and ring signatures with
zero-knowledge properties being preserved,

517
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
unlike Bitcoin and so on, multi-sig, so as
far as I know, Ergo is the only one with

518
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
such properties.

519
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:56,000
A lot of applications for privacy
protocols that are done as applications

520
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:03,000
such as ErgoMixer, so non-custodial and
non-interactive tool to restore

521
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:10,000
fungibility of coins then. Stealth
addresses, so a tool to have privacy of

522
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:17,000
recipients and so on.

523
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:27,000
To be fair to Zcash they are optional
privacy.

524
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And they are mostly transparent. So I
don't know about these days, but a few

525
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
years after launch, last time when I
checked, it was like 2% of total supply

526
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
was shielded.

527
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
So on the other hand, they are mined by
ASICs and that might explain their price

528
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
action, which touches on a whole other
topic, but again, price is not what we're

529
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
supposed to be discussing on the AMA.

530
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Some people are now coming and demanding
for full privacy in Ergo, mandatory

531
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,000
privacy, but then I'm asking those people,
are they using ErgoMixer even or whatever,

532
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,000
so it seems. Well, there is no real
interest in privacy, so people are just

533
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
chasing the popular trends.

534
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Well, to put a check on that, though,
it's not very easy to use Mixer. That

535
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,000
might be a really good candidate for a
dApp in a browser. In a browser wallet, or

536
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
even on a cell phone wallet.

537
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
But having the Mixer so that it would be
easy for an end user to just devote part

538
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
of their stash, part of their ergo, into
the Mixer so they can say, this is sort of

539
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
my private portion of my of my cash that I
can spend because it all spits out into

540
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
the stealth address and I can use that for
stuff that I don't want to be tracked and

541
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
traced on and having that be so not easy,
but.

542
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Because you should never make it too
easy. People should think about what

543
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
they're doing and understand their
assumptions. But right now, it feels like

544
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
for somebody who's non-technical, the
mixer is maybe a bridge too far. So they

545
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
might genuinely be interested in privacy
and want that option.

546
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I think what they're expressing is that
it's just too hard for them to implement

547
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
it and understand it. I sort of feel that
way. I've used the mixer a little bit, but

548
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
not really. It's a pain in the ass.

549
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:51,000
But in general, there were some arrests
of Monero users because of networking

550
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:59,000
security, right? Well, for the whole
stack, it's not easy at all to use all

551
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:07,000
those things. Even maybe if you are using
Tor, right, which is kind of red flag for

552
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:15,000
surveillance already.

553
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:26,000
There are a lot of things to consider
here, well, in regards with networking

554
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:34,000
security. So maybe we need to do some
encryption services and Ergo peer-to-peer

555
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:42,000
network rights to hide the source of
transactions with non-interactive and

556
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:50,000
non-custodial mixer. It could be the
weakest point here.

557
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:58,000
And then, mixer is not easy to use and
you need for counterparty if you mix large

558
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:06,000
enough chunk of liquidity and so on. Then
there are certain practices and maybe

559
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:14,000
default settings are suboptimal and so on.

560
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So there is a kind of complex science
here, right? And not just in Ergo, but

561
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
here in general. So if you want to have
privacy in computer networks, then it's

562
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
not user friendly at all.

563
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I have to say there are certain things
which we can do and should do but, well, a

564
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:46,000
lot of work ahead and not just here in
Ergo based on what's happening right

565
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:53,000
around and so for a few years also the
topic was basically silenced, right, in

566
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:00,000
the Ergo community as well.

567
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:12,000
So, good to see a revival of those talks
and, well, let's consider continue from

568
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:21,000
basically 2020 because, well. Regulatory
climate in America was very different a

569
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:30,000
year ago. Well, in the US, but then also a
lot of exchanges.

570
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:38,000
There were even certain attempts to
delist Ergo from some centralized

571
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:46,000
exchanges because they considered Ergo as
privacy coins. Well, it did not happen,

572
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:54,000
but there was a risk to get delisted from
some biggest exchanges by volume even now.

573
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So, well, it was quite tricky even to
talk about privacy rights, well,

574
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:11,000
especially in public. I like tweeting
anything or whatever so for that you can

575
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:19,000
get ERG delisted rights from centralized
exchange or whatever.

576
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:28,000
So happily now it's a different climate
and we can continue basically from 2020

577
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:36,000
from that state and, well, it's good after
all. And, well, still it's not outdated

578
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:44,000
stack and so on. So we can continue.

579
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
kushti, let's just give a quick props to
the devs before we close out today. I just

580
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
popped a few things. We're a little late,
but we did start a little late. Let me

581
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
just roll through them really quickly in a
minute, just to give a heads up to people.

582
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Let's see, kushti worked on R&D, reviewed
and opened an issue, worked on some sub

583
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
blocks, re-worked forking logic, continued
to work on white paper, and he worked on

584
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Sigma SDK polishing and going to publish
more examples, and he got a review up

585
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
there.

586
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Big update from Rosen Bridge. The final
test milestone for Bitcoin Runes release

587
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:31,000
has started. They hope to finish important
ones and start Bitcoin Runes development

588
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:37,000
deployment procedure. Awesome, by next
week. On chain token map they worked on

589
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,000
all supported tokens of the bridge is to
find an adjacent structured file very

590
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:49,000
cool. Let's see a UI app summary. They
added a new extracted a fetch token map

591
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:55,000
boxes Added callback to Rosen service and
added a wrap token map Rosen bridge guard

592
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:01,000
app they updated and they updated the
Rosen bridge app as well very cool.

593
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So then ergo wallet and so there is need
to update ergo wallet and, well, consider

594
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:19,000
maintenance and then development, right?
So, well, if you guys know any kotlin java

595
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:28,000
android developers so, well, so try to get
them to our...

596
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I'll talk to kushti. Awesome. We've got
Updating I think one of the last ones from

597
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,000
cyberverse. They're trucking along still
making their in-game battles a thing

598
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,000
They've completed their first version of a
death system low HP neutral Neural

599
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,000
distortion and visual corruption. Yes
collapse sequence and hospital response

600
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,000
and recovery breathing fogger. So that's
pretty cool. Very cool And that's it for

601
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
the dev updates and we are definitely over
time guys

602
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,000
And there are also updates from Git
circles, Lithos and so on. So we need to

603
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:12,000
push the teams to publish over the dev
chat. Not just them. And by the way, so we

604
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,000
can also do Twitter space on Lithos,
right? Because they have planned to launch

605
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,000
a test at mining soon.

606
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Yeah, we should do that. That should be
some afternoon sometime. So Joe and Cheese

607
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
can be awake and participate and talk
about Lithos. That'd be great. I can ping

608
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
them right now before I forget.

609
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Alright guys, thanks so much for joining
us. We'll see you next week around the

610
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,000
same time Thanks for those that popped on
for those that come into the waiting room

611
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
and chat And we bring you in and then you
leave I can't tell if you're a spammer or

612
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
not So if you want to chat and have your
video here of your audio here coming

613
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
before the start of the meeting is always
the easiest and Pop on your audio or you

614
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
video in chat with us for a bit so we can
verify you're not a racist spammer drawing

615
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,000
bad things on the screen or sharing
pornography standard on on just Following

616
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
the chat or the one that's on youtube Or
maybe you do on youtube and then that way

617
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,000
people can participate but we just

618
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
You know, we copy those because
otherwise, I don't know. Oh, I was

619
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
reading. I've got the questions. I've got
a question. You pasted them in chat before

620
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I could get before I did. But we put
questions up. I think we're following

621
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
these. I mean people who want to come in
person and push in and talk with audio.

622
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Great man is what I was referring to.

623
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
We hope to have more of them as long as
it works.

624
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
It's a proof of work, though. So you
actually have to work to show us that

625
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
you're not going to spam us or scam us on
the live stream, that's for sure.

626
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
In this regard, maybe Twitter space is
better, right? So it's immediately seen

627
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
there, I mean, in some history. Who you
are.

628
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
That's true. That is true. Maybe we can
try that next week. That's probably a good

629
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
idea, kushti.

630
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Okay, great, everybody. Thanks so much
everybody have a good day and week ciao
