00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello everyone, and welcome to the
Pattern demo.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And today, I'm thrilled to introduce you
to Pattern, our AI-powered agent that

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
connects to multiple data sources to
deliver real-time blockchain insights.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Pattern has been architected from the
ground up as a modular, extensible AI

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
agent.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
At its core, Pattern maintains connectors
to a variety of live data streams,

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
everything from public APIs to on-chain
data providers.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Today, we'll focus on Pattern's
blockchain integration capabilities.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
By leveraging common blockchain APIs,
Pattern can fetch smart contract source

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
code and ABI, invoke contract functions
directly, pull transaction histories, and

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
even perform on-chain analytics on the
fly.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
To get started, let's look at how Pattern
interfaces with blockchains.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We've built connectors for many of the
most widely used chains, Ethereum, Binance

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, and more.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For this hackathon, we're excited to
announce that we've extended Pattern's

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
reach to include the Ergo ecosystem.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That means you can now ask Pattern about
Ergo smart contracts, transactions, token

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
data, and other on-chain details in real
time.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let me show you a quick example.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's go to the Pattern demo site at
mvp.pattern.global.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There, you can sign in with your Gmail
account or wallet and begin typing your

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
query.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
For example, I'll ask, to which contract
does the box, provide the address, belong?

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What is that contract's ErgoTree script?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Then, simply wait for the pattern agent
to scan the available Ergo tools, pick the

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:28,000
most relevant ones, and retrieve the data.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Now you can see the agent's response to
this query, including the extracted

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
ErgoTree script.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Next, I'll ask, what is that ErgoTree
script about?

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And then wait for the answer.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Here, you can see the pattern agent's
response to the explanation of this

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
ErgoTree script.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Here's another example.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
First, start a new chat so the previous
history won't affect your new query.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Then ask, when was the last transaction
of the wallet at address, giving the

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
address, and how much ERG was transferred
to the owner of the first box?

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And hit Enter.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
As shown in the model's response, it
first retrieves the wallet's most recent

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
transaction, then identifies the owner of
the first box linked to that wallet from

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
the transaction data to calculate how much
ERG was sent to them.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Below, you can see the details of the
last transaction, including the amount

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
transferred to the wallet owner.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Whether you want to fetch on-chain data,
analyze contracts, or track wallet

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
activity, the agent is ready to help.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We'd love to hear how it works for you,
so please share any thoughts or

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
suggestions you have after exploring the
demo.
