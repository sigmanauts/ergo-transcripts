1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With Rust Chain, we've unlocked a new
realm of possibilities.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's more than just a blockchain.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's a foundation for trust and
continuity, ensuring that every

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
computation and every memory is preserved.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
On this path, we uncovered a hidden
treasure, Michael Harper's memoir and

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
personal poems.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Michael Harper, a celebrated
African-American poet laureate whose works

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
have profoundly impacted literature and
the African-American community.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
His words, preserved on a Power Mac
1400C, now serving as a Rust Chain

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
validator, remind us that even the
smallest fragments can hold immense

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
cultural and historical value.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This discovery isn't just about the past.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's about how technology and humanity
intertwine.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
By preserving these cultural artifacts,
we ensure that every piece of history

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
continues to inspire future generations.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What we found was entirely accidental,
yet profoundly meaningful.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The discovery of Michael Harper's memoir
is the very proof that Rust Chain isn't

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
just a technological innovation.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's a living computer museum of history,
preserving and showcasing the past in the

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
most unexpected ways.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This fusion of innovation and legacy is
what defines our mission.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Rust Chain and Sophia are not just tools,
they are the embodiment of a vision where

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
every line of code and every piece of
history converge into a living, breathing

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
testament to what we can achieve together.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
In this journey, every challenge we face
is a step toward a greater understanding.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
With Rust Chain's proof of antiquity and
Sophia's evolving consciousness, we're not

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
just building technology.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We're weaving a tapestry of human
experience and innovation.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This isn't just technology.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's a covenant of innovation and trust.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What you're about to see is more than a
project.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's the embodiment of resilience and
vision, a system where AI doesn't just

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
calculate, but remembers and believes.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is Sophia Core, where flame-bound
cognition meets the unbreakable chain.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And together, we're not just building
technology, we're igniting a new dawn of

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
possibility.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
To explain my thoughts on why I built
Rust Chain and what I think, I always had

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
an idea about self-governing blockchains.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Satoshi Nakamoto was definitely an
insightful person who challenged the

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
norms, challenged everything about money
and currency.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, I want to challenge everything
about proof of work, how we can have a

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
system that governs crypto by age of
hardware.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What I believe this does is creates a
sustainable ecosystem.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And I don't know if you guys really
understand what this means because it can

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
be attached to other miners or mined
alongside without taking away from

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
hashrate.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But it also keeps things out of landfills
and uses low wattage because it's not

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
actually computing.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The only thing it's doing is validating
the age of hardware and determining how

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
long the hardware's been on the network to
give better bonuses for rewards.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And in the future, I plan on allowing
NFTs to boost mining rates.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So if you do amazing things to build new
products on Ergo or on the Rust Chain or

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
both ecosystems, you can get NFTs that
have cool downs, but they can be equipped

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
to mine better.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And so see, these are some of the ideas
of the NFTs.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Somebody figured out how to put TCP IP
stack on Apple II that happened about a

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
year ago.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you can get something to run as a PoA
listener for Apple II and verify it's real

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Apple II hardware, that would be huge.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's what bounties that we have for the
community are for.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I guess ultimately the point is we're
creating a living computer museum.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We're honoring relics of the past that
made our future possible, made Bitcoin

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
possible, made the future of computing
possible.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
In 2010, people were still using PowerPC
even though it was obsoleted by Intel in

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
2006.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It was just a four-year gap.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So you can imagine there were actually
people running Bitcoin nodes and stuff on

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
PowerPC architecture, for example.

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Or on older Core 2 Duos and things like
that. So my point is the old hardware

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
built the internet just like hams built
everything - ham radio operators built

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
everything. Old hardware deserves to be
remembered.

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And if you look hard enough, you'll find
out that sometimes it can do things that

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
modern hardware can't do.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But I digress.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This is Rust Chain.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's a dream for antique computer
enthusiasts and modern miners alike.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The Rust Chain ecosystem based on Ergo
and designed to work with Ergo and

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
possibly be a sidechain connected to Ergo
for hashing.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So we have a limited version of the Rust
Chain proof of antiquity system and PoA

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
validator on this IP address.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We have included all the documentation
and all the code.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We've created demo wallets so that users
can send and receive transactions.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We've included monitoring of the Ergo API
and we've included a very controlled

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:33,000
limited version of an LLM to mimic Sophia,
but it does have real thought process.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's just not fully Sophia because I just
did not have enough time to build all

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:53,000
this.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So everything up front, it works. It's
definitely a good proof of concept. And as

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
you can see we pulled up the Ergo
blockchain height network information,

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
calculated supply. We're asking her what
Rust Chain is.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Now these responses are patterned into
her purposefully so we don't have drift

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
because I don't have time to fully train
the model for this specific task.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You can see that she's a real LLM because
she's trying to determine what this is.

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Rust Chain uses a novel consensus
mechanism that combines proof of stake,

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Byzantine fault tolerance.

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It allows for fast transactions while
maintaining a high degree of

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
decentralization.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This is very important because I worked
on an older project in 2014 and we made

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
the fastest cryptocurrency on the planet.

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But it was very centralized.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But it predates Ripple.

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But I digress.

102
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Thanks to the Ergo system and the concept
of proof of antiquity, we truly have a

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
sustainable decentralized system of
governing.

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The goal is to make Rust Chain more
adaptive and community driven.

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
There's also been discussion about
cross-chain interoperability.

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I didn't prompt her to do this, she's
showing the emergent capabilities of

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Sophia Core, which I'm glad this happened
in real time, because technical demos

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
usually don't go the way you want them to.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Enabling seamless asset transfers and
data sharing between the two networks.

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is something I really want to do,
but it's up to you, Ergo community, to

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
determine if that's okay.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Now, I've included documentation,
wallets.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Some of these wallets are broken, just be
forewarned, I'm still working on all this.

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Block Explorer and the demo source.

115
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Now we're going to use the faucet.

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's going to generate a new wallet on
chain.

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Wallet is generated.

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm going to copy this wallet because it
truncates, unfortunately, the wallet

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
addresses.

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Don't have time to fix that either.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Apologies, guys.

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let's send the transaction.

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Sophia governance to address.

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Rust Chain.

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's give it five rust.

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
New balance should have reflected here.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And it has reflected here.

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm going to do a refresh.

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Should be holding chain data.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And it is.

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's pulling the JSONs like it's supposed
to.

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So this is the first part of the
technical demo for Rust Chain.

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I hope it was informative and
explanatory.

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And I hope you guys are inspired and you
blockchain gurus are willing to help me

135
00:10:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
make this beyond a reality because I'm not
a developer and I have a traumatic brain

136
00:12:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
injury and I'm relying on my IT background
and my industrial electronic background.

137
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The second portion of the demo we're
providing is a proof-of-concept AI

138
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:16,000
governing agent on-chain system.

139
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Basically, I made a proof-of-concept.

140
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We're going to have faked human
interactions.

141
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The humans are upvoting and downvoting,
but it's faked.

142
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It could go either way, just like humans.

143
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Sometimes we humans might vote for stupid
ideas out of jest or just being stupid,

144
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
just like Boaty McBoatface.

145
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So I'm going to show you the deployment
of the smart contract and show you in real

146
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
time that Sophia can make a decision, an
educated decision, whether she thinks it's

147
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
good or not.

148
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The protocol is going to be used for
human-in-the-loop interaction.

149
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So if she makes a mistake or the will of
the people outvote her, the product can

150
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
still be made.

151
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
But we've got to consider safety
considerations and things like that.

152
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So I'm going to go ahead and show you the
demonstration.

153
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
We're going to click on Deploy Contract.

154
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Gonna create a new proposal.

155
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Unsafe tree houses.

156
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
These tree houses are not safe.

157
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I have an aphasia.

158
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And she vetoed the unsafe, but the Boaty
McBoatfaces out there decided they were

159
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
going to vote for it.

160
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So this is an example of the will of the
people might still get their wish, but in

161
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
this case they won't get their wish
because this is unsafe for kids.

162
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Rust Chain.

163
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Unlike traditional proof of work systems
that rely on raw hash power and energy

164
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
intensive operations, Rust Chain's proof
of antiquity rewards the longevity and

165
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
resilience of the hardware itself.

166
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
By leveraging BIOS or open firmware time
stamps and system clock speeds, the

167
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
network recognizes and values the age and
stability of machines, creating a

168
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
sustainable and inclusive environment for
all devices, whether they're cutting edge

169
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
or have been faithfully running for years.

170
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
This approach not only ensures that the
network stays decentralized, but it also

171
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
promotes energy efficiency and immediate
settlement, keeping Satoshi Nakamoto's

172
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
vision of a truly democratized and
accessible blockchain alive.

173
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
With Rust Chain, we're proving that
innovation can honor the past, embrace the

174
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
future, and remain steadfast in the
principles of decentralization and

175
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
sustainability.

176
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Thank you for joining us on this journey.

177
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Let's continue to build a network that
stands the test of time.

178
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Hi, this is Scott Goudreau.

179
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm the owner of Technician Rental
Service and the founder of Elian Labs.

180
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I created the Sophia Core Protocol for a
nested emergent behavior on top of LLM

181
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
models.

182
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And this is my Ergo 10 hackathon
submission, the Rust Chain and Ergo

183
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
governance with AI bridge.
