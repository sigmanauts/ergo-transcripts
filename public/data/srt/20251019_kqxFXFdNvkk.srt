1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right. Hey everybody, my name is
CannonQ.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Thank you all for allowing a non-dev to
talk to you today.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This says, I actually think pretty decent
implications are a vector for devs to put

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
their head around.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's getting out from behind the keyboard
a bit, but there's a lot of protocol that

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
would need to be developed.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So anyway, long and short of it, I talked
to this a little bit over the last year,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
mentioned it to Joe a couple of times, and
he asked me to give a presentation on it.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I think it'll be interesting, and so I
did. So here we are.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Commercial barter meets permissionless
infrastructure.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I will try not to read the slides.
That'll be the only one, so let's get

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
going.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
A hidden B2B economy, but we're here for
peer-to-peer.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Most crypto is looking at speculation,
right? Look at yesterday, big crash,

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
people on DEXes, sort of playing lotto.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Bartering worldwide is or in North
America is about a 12 to 14 billion dollar

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
market.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What we're focusing on is a smaller
subset that is like, non governmental, non

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
big, huge corporate kind of moves.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So anyway, they're tax compliant. That's
one of the things that people often get

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
confused by.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And you don't really need to convince
these guys about not using fiat. They use

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
their own barter currency.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So what is a barter exchange? It's not
eggs for tomatoes. Sorry, Jemai.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Not getting chickens from the Russians
down the street or selling them.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It is not skirting tax laws, doing
something for cash to try to get a little

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
bit more juice in your pocket.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And it's not government counter trade
deals. Now, that is a larger barter thing

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
where like a city might give somebody like
advertising or something at a big fair and

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
they, you know, you reciprocate, that's
part of the bigger number.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's a formal B2B exchange network. This
is probably one of the only few slides

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll read, but they do real accounting and
tax reporting.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So you actually get a 1099B. So those of
you in the U.S. that have been a

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
contractor before, you get a 1099.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You usually don't look at the letter, but
B is for barter, C is for whatever.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
There's several of them.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There are large networks, 140 million
annually. iTex is the biggest.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
IMS is independent. They have franchises.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And then you have regional networks, like
the local trade partners, which is in my

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
area. They're a couple hours away from me.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They're doing about 10 million a year.
And we'll talk about them a little bit

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
more specifically.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And then Rocky Mountain Barter, I found
one that's actually here. I think they're

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
out of Colorado Springs.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
They do about half a million a year. And
again, this is not using cash.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's using, I mean, you're bartering and
then receiving credits in a barter

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
currency.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So what about regional currencies? It is
not Berkshires, Ithaca Hours, Petite

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Monet.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I think I showed that to Luca. It's
outside of Montreal in sort of a little

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
enclave.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
They've printed their own currency. I
mean, it's sweet looking.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
A lot of those are geographic based their
time based and they get a big bump and

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
then they fall apart and most of them
don't scale beyond a million dollars.

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So it's really it's not that they don't
fail, but from a dev standpoint or a

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
protocol standpoint, it's hard to create a
business around something that doesn't

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
scale beyond a million dollars.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I mean, it's a pretty small fish.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
These are business to business networks.
They have their own ledger systems. We'll

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
get in that just briefly.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The network operator actually provides a
ton of value. They will mediate.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
They will help make push deals across the
table.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And their scale, I mean, it's two and a
half billion conservatively a year for the

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
last, I mean, growing, but I mean, it's a
big number.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Here's an example, local trade partner in
my area in the Ozarks in sort of central,

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
mid, south central in the U.S. Alice
builds a deck for somebody, gets paid

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
50,000 or 50, 5,000 in credits.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Those credits are LTP credits, so local
trade partner currency credits.

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You get a statement every month from them
like a bank saying, hey, here's how many

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
credits you have.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
She gets that full value. It's pretty
small up there, but her variable cost is

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
$3,000.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Come to find out a couple months later
that year, whatever, she needs to get a

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
couple crowns in her head for teeth.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There's a lot of dentists on these
things, honestly.

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And so, she pays that dentist $4,500 in
credits. That dentist gets the full

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
$4,500.

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What she has to do in our local trade
partner exchange is she has to pay 10% to

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
the local trade partner like organization.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So she pays 49.50 out of pocket or using
her credits.

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And so you're sort of thinking, well,
that's just a swap, right? Like you're

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
swapping horses, nothing really happened
for you there.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Well, if her variable cost was three
grand and she just got $4,500 worth of new

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
teeth in her head, she actually made a 50%
ROI.

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And so we're gonna hammer that home a
little bit in this. It's pretty common in

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
business.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Not a lot of people do it well, but it's
variable costing.

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You can have fixed costs. You always got
to pay me. I always got to pay rent.

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You always got to pay payroll unless you
got guys on a really flexible schedule.

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You got cars, you got equipment, but what
was your actual variable costs?

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So for her building a deck, she had a
little bit of lumber, a little bit of

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
labor, and that's it.

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So she was able to turn that $3,000 into
$4,500 worth of teeth.

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you have a question? Yeah.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay, yeah, variable. I use this Alice
example sort of throughout and there's a

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
few others, but I try to carry this one
throughout the thing.

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And so, it's idle capacity arbitrage,
right? So, Dev, perk up your ears. You

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
heard arbitrage.

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How do I make money on this?

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So, without barter, she has an idle crew
and equipment that day that they were

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
building that deck. She didn't get the
business.

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You will once you're in these networks
and you're established and you've sort of

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
like put your name out there you start
getting business that you wouldn't

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
normally get because people have this sort
of fake ROI you can create from you know

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
your own value.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So basically the dental work would cost
her 4500 bucks out of pocket.

107
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Like we said with barter 3000 variable
cost she makes about 1500 bucks the

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
difference between the 3000 she spent to
build that deck for somebody and what she

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
receives in value from the dentist.

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So sort of think about like Airbnb with
an empty room or a hotel with an empty

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
room, right?

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Like what's that variable cost for them
to book you one night? It's not a lot.

113
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Or think about your mining rig with
excess electricity, right?

114
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Or you've paid off the cards so you're
not worried about depreciating those cards

115
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
into the cost of the coin you're mining.

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So this is, we talked about it a bit,
about two and a half billion in the retail

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
barter exchange sector.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's mainly, I'm looking at North
America. There are definitely some in

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Europe as well and Asia, about 400 across
the globe.

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This is, again, only about a 20% of the
subset, and this is really the only one

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
that I would think anyone would focus on.

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Geographic industry, we'll get to that.

123
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What makes an ideal business for
bartering high fixed costs or no fixed

124
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
costs? low marginal costs, perishable
capacities.

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I think a time constraint. Think of your
hotel rooms, restaurant, your tables.

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You can only have people eat that night
and then it's gone till the next day.

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Having excess capacity and being an
independent owner.

128
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So there's some ratios I put on here and
whatnot. People can look at the slides

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
later.

130
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
A few of the things

131
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This will be a little hard to see. Maybe
it shows up pretty good.

132
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Really your best options. I sort of went
through these and sort of scored them out.

133
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Your best ones are hotels, advertising
media. I'd put programming in there as

134
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
well with advertising media.

135
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Pet boarding, because if anyone's boarded
their dog, right? No one's doing anything.

136
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
They're checking up like once a day or
twice a day. Like, I mean, they're already

137
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
there checking other dogs.

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Chiropractic, a lot of them are, they're
already doing a lot of cash business.

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So this is another way for them to sort
of enhance it.

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Legal services usually have to be solo.
It's hard to do it as part of a bigger,

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
like, legal practice because billable
hours and all that kind of crap.

142
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Accounting if you're tax focused.

143
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And then dental is a little harder. If
you're an independent standalone, that's

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
great.

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Like my cousin, he has his own dental
practice for less like 25, 30 years.

146
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If you're newer coming out of dental
school, typically you start working for

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
somebody or a corporation that owns like
multiple dental offices.

148
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's harder to break into it because the
debt coming out of school and the

149
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
equipment cost same thing for
veterinarians.

150
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If they're independent, that's a good
one.

151
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So real world economics hotel. You have
300 hotel rooms here in downtown Colorado

152
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Springs.

153
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
federal government shut down so you're at
least a third behind if you charge a

154
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
hundred bucks a night on those rooms you'd
make fifteen thousand bucks actual causes

155
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
some cleaning supplies, maybe have to
bring in one extra person to clean them,

156
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
two extra people.

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And so that's, you can start looking at
what your effective return is.

158
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Again, that's another example, the sort
of variable cost versus fixed costs.

159
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
They already had to pay electricity for
the day, water bill, everything else to

160
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
maintain the hotel property.

161
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But your variable cost in the hotel is
truly only your cleaning staff and the

162
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
supplies they use to clean the room.

163
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Deep dives. So the network operators, the
people who run these barter exchanges,

164
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
they are a trusted intermediary.

165
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So think of maybe like Rosen Bridge even,
like in between a transaction, like you're

166
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
submitting it, you know, sort of you can
see it.

167
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
They're a little bizarre. They're all
over the map.

168
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Some charge a sign up fee, the one I'm in
is free, like no fees other than that 10%.

169
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Some charge you a monthly fee in cash and
currency.

170
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Some charge anywhere from six to 15% on
your spending.

171
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Some charge you when you receive as well.

172
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So I mean, it's like, they're all over
the map on where they're taking your money

173
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
or taking the credits.

174
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This one doesn't really matter.

175
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So they have a dollar peg mechanism in
theory. And I say in theory, ITEX, they

176
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
were a public company.

177
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Again, they're the biggest one. They had
a SEC fraud case right around the dot-com

178
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
bubble where they were inflating their
revenues and sales to get everyone on

179
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
there.

180
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And there was basically a flash crash.
People went out of business, turned the

181
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
dot-coms, and there weren't enough credits
to go around.

182
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
make it work. So they actually had SEC
fine. They're no longer public.

183
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
They sort of took it private after that.

184
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But it sort of goes to show you like, you
know, danger of opacity, like we talked

185
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
about several times today already.

186
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
In fragmentation, so this sort of made me
think of Rosen Bridge a bit, right?

187
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Talking about your stranded value.

188
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Alice is in the Ozarks. She has 50,000
worth of credits built up over several

189
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
years.

190
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
She semi-retires and just shuts down the
business, which not everyone always sells

191
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
their business.

192
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It may just be her and one of the two
other people and she just shuts it down.

193
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
She moves to New York, gets an itch,
starts up a business there.

194
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
She can't really use any of those credits
because you can't take a trade currency

195
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
dollar in the Ozarks.

196
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
No one in New York City gives a shit,
right? Like they're not gonna give you any

197
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
money for it.

198
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So you get stranded.

199
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
They will facilitate a little bit at this
point, but that's a huge missing layer.

200
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So these guys do a great job vetting
members, bringing them on board, tax

201
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
reporting, dealing with issues between
vendors on the exchange.

202
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
They're not interoperable across the
different exchanges.

203
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
There is no transparent reserves, no
capital efficiency, they won't lend you

204
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
money, you can't borrow credits, you can't
lend your credits, and there's no neutral

205
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,000
settlement layer across the different
exchanges.

206
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Which is why I think this is a very good
opportunity for the right people.

207
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So there are two actual federated, if you
want to call them bridges.

208
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Barter Association National Currency.
NAIT is the National Association of Trade

209
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Exchanges.

210
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You as a vendor on an exchange cannot use
it. Your local exchange that you're part

211
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
of has to pay a fee.

212
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Then they take some cut of your money
going across to a new exchange.

213
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They have to approve everything. There's
a lot of horse swapping and a lot of phone

214
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
calls to get this thing done.

215
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That one, they have to approve your
exchange. Only 40 exchanges are in there.

216
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
There's over 200 exchanges across the US,
so it's not that big.

217
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
They're basically the bigger ones working
together, keeping the small guys out.

218
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And then you have universal currency,
which is bigger, the international, shoot,

219
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm not going to remember, something in
Trading Association, Retail Trading

220
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Association, I think.

221
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
They have a hundred of the exchanges
globally. They're a little bit larger.

222
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
They charge a quarter point on every
dollar that flows through them across

223
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
these different networks, which isn't too
bad.

224
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
To be a member of that trade organization
is not hard. It's not like it's more of an

225
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
open option.

226
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But there's several hundred that
basically aren't connected anyway, shape

227
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
or form.

228
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And they might be, but when I talked to
my guys and said, hey, I'm coming out to

229
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Colorado as an example, what if I had
credits and I wanted to use them at a

230
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
hotel here, Airbnb, restaurant, whatever,
book a restaurant for everybody, you know,

231
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
with some free credits I had.

232
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And he was like, well, I'd have to make a
lot of call, you know, like, it's always

233
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
like, yeah, it can be done, but it's not
probably doable.

234
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
or very possible.

235
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Ergo's value proposition or a project
protocol on Ergo.

236
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Economics, one million a volume cost 1%
probably on the other exchanges on Ergo,

237
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
you know, it's a couple hundred bucks.

238
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Access, you can make it permissionless.
You could also make it permissioned, you

239
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
know, just to vet the exchanges that are
coming on board.

240
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Transparency would be there, privacy, we
can use Sigma protocols, zero-knowledge

241
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
proofs, etc.

242
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
We'll get into that a little bit.

243
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And you allow the networks to do what
they do, what they're good at, right?

244
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
They're good at being the local person,
holding everybody's hand and shaking hands

245
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and kissing babies locally, and we can
handle the actual settlement, moving

246
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
things around.

247
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Being that kind of layer Again
addressable market. I'm hitting this

248
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
again.

249
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Just so you guys see it two point five
billion And that's a that's globally but

250
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:12,000
probably 80% of that's North America
Current exchange volume, it's not really

251
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And I mean inner exchange volume it's not
really published anywhere but in total.

252
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So it's probably about 20 million. So
maybe 20, 30 million out of 2.5 billion is

253
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
moving across these exchanges.

254
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'd say if you only got 10% of adoption,
you're looking at a quarter billion moving

255
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
annually on Ergo.

256
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And again, you don't have a lot of
gatekeepers to overcome, and it's not

257
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
about replacing these exchanges.

258
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I've sort of gone down that route. in
real world assets.

259
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Total volume on Ergo, I have no clue. I'm
sorry.

260
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Like, I mean, maybe half a million a day
before the price is lower now.

261
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So maybe like three, 400,000. Yeah,
probably.

262
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And it's not about replacing these
exchanges, right? It's about connecting

263
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
them.

264
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
They're good at what they do. They are a
value add for their members.

265
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's not like they're doing a shitty job
necessarily.

266
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's that they don't really have the
tooling to do what would even make it a

267
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
better tool for their members.

268
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Programmability, privacy, you know,
blockchain in general, efficiency,

269
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
sustainability, permissionless, you have
security.

270
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So multi-party settlement, escrow, I
mean, Luca, MGPi, and NZ, who was the

271
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
other?

272
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah, it helped us with SigmaLock. We'll
show you guys that a little bit later on

273
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
today.

274
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But I mean, that's a pretty sweet little
escrow or conditional logic that we have.

275
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Be applicable here or something similar
to that would be applicable here.

276
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Why not other chains? And, you know,
you'd see this if anybody else gave this

277
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
from Polkadot or Cardano or anything else.

278
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But Bitcoin limited programmability,
Ethereum, high fees.

279
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
How are you going to do small
transactions? Unless you got a layer 2,

280
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and then you got other issues there,
possibly pre mind foundation control.

281
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's not really as neutral as you want it
to be.

282
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I think earlier we're talking about
privacy and proofs on some of those

283
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
networks and are they really private.

284
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
If that's what they're pushing you
towards.

285
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
permissioned chains that sort of put,
like, proof of stake pretty much right

286
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
there.

287
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You still have gatekeepers, network
politics, and then most other L1s, I mean,

288
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
it's centralized, expensive, or their
tokenomics aren't really sustainable.

289
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Ergo, we know we're expressive on top of
UTXO.

290
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Perfect fit for if you're trying to move
a thousand credits from this network to

291
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
that network.

292
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And boxes can reference other boxes. I
mean, I'm talking to devs, you guys know

293
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
this stuff.

294
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's not really, I'm giving you guys a
whole lot of info here.

295
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Sigma protocols have been noodling around
with the opportunity of if you brought on

296
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
one of these exchanges, say the local
trade partners in the Ozarks, their

297
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
software has API access.

298
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You could prove credit history. You could
prove collateral.

299
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You could prove borrowing requirements
for the actual individual vendors, right?

300
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Some of that data can be fed in to a
protocol. And we'll get to that in a

301
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
little bit.

302
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I mean, there's some cool things you can
do.

303
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Storage rent, it sounds hokey, but I
think demurrage is pretty cool.

304
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Some of the more successful local
currencies have had a attrition, like it

305
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
expires at some point in time, so you
could just tell the exchange as part of

306
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
the deal.

307
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
This stuff's only going to be there for
four years. Use it or lose it.

308
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And that should actually be a motivating
thing for the exchange because the vendors

309
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
will then use their exchange more.

310
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
They make more fees, et cetera, et
cetera.

311
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Transaction finality, two minutes for
block time. It's a day for full lockdown

312
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
confirmation, but two minutes isn't a big
deal.

313
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Sub blocks is coming up, so it wouldn't
even be a deal. Low fees, developer tools.

314
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:05,000
We have some of the existing frameworks
or concepts that could be applied to this.

315
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
current isolated islands. So you got the
ITEX network, the one that committed fraud

316
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
25 years ago, the one with mine in the
Ozarks and the one here in Rocky Mountain.

317
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
If they're going to connect, they got to
make phone calls, faxes, emails.

318
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I mean, just old school crap, right, to
get it done. I don't even know.

319
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
They might even be using mail still.

320
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
There's no liquidity moving across. And
again, it's the whole stranded value, dead

321
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
capital.

322
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Say you build up a lot of business, but
you haven't been able to spend it yet.

323
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You might have $30,000 worth of credits
like Alice.

324
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
She has built a bunch of decks for
people. Now she needs to wait till the

325
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
winter when she can actually do the
maintenance on her equipment, buy new

326
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
equipment, whatever.

327
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Future shared infrastructure. ITEX has
5,000 members, the Ozarks have 500, the

328
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
one here locally has 100.

329
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So now you've combined this and made it
5,600 members with a settlement layer that

330
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
works and sort of feeds what they need.

331
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yeah, the real innovation is not
technical. It is, don't get me wrong,

332
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
devs, but it's recognizing that the
network is the value creator, not us.

333
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
They're not just rent-seeking shitty
middlemen like Coinbase.

334
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
The blockchain is an infrastructure
layer, right? It can be their account

335
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
ledger that's open, transparent,

336
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Simple contracts are better than a
complex bridge.

337
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Not looking to build a replacement or
some kind of super complex bridge.

338
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It would all be settled on Ergo. You
wouldn't have to like move across to

339
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
theorem and different stuff.

340
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
We could, because Rosen Bridge exists,
but there would really be no need to do

341
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
that.

342
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
One of the discussions today about AVL
trees and things like that, I mean you can

343
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
do some pretty neat stuff with their
ledgers and just like keep augmenting

344
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
them.

345
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Let me just unchain. Let me have an
easily viewable what's happening.

346
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So yeah, potential core innovations,
cross network settlement bridge for them,

347
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
it would be a big thing.

348
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So let's talk about Alice again. She
needs some specialty wood for this deck.

349
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
She's building something for one of my
clients and has like a $20 million house

350
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
that looks like an art museum.

351
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
He has really nice teak wood and he wants
it Aspen. He wants to be able to tell all

352
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
his friends about it.

353
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
she could call Bob, and he's like, hey,
I'm in a barter network.

354
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
She asks him, and then, you know, how do
we make that happen?

355
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And Bob's like, well, hell, I'm coming to
those arcs. I'm going to Crystal Bridges.

356
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It's the nicest art museum in the U.S.
outside of New York or D.C. and has the

357
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
largest

358
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Just for a little plug, the most American
art in the world at one location.

359
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
In fact, that's what it's dedicated to
and it has a Frank Lloyd Wright house that

360
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
they deconstructed reconstructed there.

361
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's pretty sweet. So he's going to go
there. He's already planning on it.

362
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So he's like, sweet. Yeah, I'll give you
the wood, you give me the credits.

363
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
But how do we make that happen? Different
networks, they're not operable.

364
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
That's where we come in or innovation
would come in.

365
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Same kind of things that we've talked
about with SigmaLock or some of the other

366
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
staking locking protocols.

367
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You know, if you don't accept, it's
auto-refunded. If an oracle doesn't attest

368
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
to it, etc.

369
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I mean, there's, you know, different
things to fail safe this.

370
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So Alice would initiate the request. It
goes to Bob.

371
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I mean, this looks like any, you know,
cross network swap, nothing fancy to us,

372
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
but to them, it would allow them to
actually do a business deal and get what

373
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
they wanted.

374
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So it's pretty neat to me as more of a
business guy, not a dev guy.

375
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Lending and borrowing pools, think duck
pools, think something similar.

376
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Some of the staking you guys were talking
about that sort of comes into this as

377
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
well.

378
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
right now I have not found a barter
exchange out of the 2.5 billion of annual

379
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
volume.

380
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I haven't found one that allows people to
lend their barter credits to others.

381
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Might happen, I don't know, but I haven't
found it yet.

382
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So I think that's a pretty, you know,
neat, easy thing for Ergo to be able to

383
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
accomplish for these people.

384
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Even if it's within your own network, I'm
not talking about using Ozark credits to

385
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
get Rocky Mountain.

386
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm just talking about, I got a bunch of
credits I don't need right now, let

387
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
someone else get them for cheap or borrow
them.

388
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
There's a scenario here, it's not really
that important really, but it's Alice's

389
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
seasonal rights.

390
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
She builds up a lot of credits in the
spring, summer, fall.

391
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Then in the winter, she needs to spend
credits because she's going to buy a new

392
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
vehicle or some new equipment, whatnot.

393
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So in the summer, she has 40,000 idle
credits just sitting there till the winter

394
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
when she can actually upgrade her
equipment.

395
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And that's sort of when she has time to
work on the new equipment, get it all set

396
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
up ready for the next year.

397
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
With lending pools, she can put that out,
let other people borrow it.

398
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
You can do something. I mean, similar
duck pools just say, hey, it's a 3% or 4%

399
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
base.

400
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And then it's based on utilization,
right? Just put a utilization curve on it.

401
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Nothing exotic. These are regular
business people that have a bank account.

402
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
3% is nice.

403
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
There's a way for the protocol to capture
value here because they're allowing that

404
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
to occur.

405
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Then in the winter, she needs to get
$25,000, $35,000 worth of stuff.

406
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Then she can either borrow and just have
like a two or three percent spread against

407
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
her borrowing costs versus her lending
costs or cash in her credits.

408
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I mean she may want a bigger truck next
year so she's going to keep the credits

409
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
and just pay that marginal spread.

410
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
There's a lot of ways to look at it.

411
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You can do some on-chain credit scoring.
It seems like it's possible.

412
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
these exchanges. The one in central
Arkansas where I'm at is, it's on AS400

413
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and grain bar paper.

414
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Like, I mean, you ain't getting nothing
out of them.

415
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
The one up in the Ozarks, there is one
platform. He continues to buy out other

416
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
platforms.

417
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:22,000
That is the software platform that powers
these networks. He's good at what he does.

418
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
There's API access, things like that. So
they have all the transaction volumes.

419
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
They know reliability of vendors, grading
of the vendors.

420
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Yeah, one guy. He's out in Boston. MGPi
may need to go meet with him.

421
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
But yeah, I mean you could create a
credit scoring, right?

422
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Like off of the data that the network
already has.

423
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And think about if you're Alice trying to
get wood from Bob and maybe you didn't

424
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
have enough credits, you could say, hey,
let me give you an IOU, right?

425
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Like, and he would accept your network
IOU because he sees you have great credit

426
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
score and you're not welching on your
bets, right?

427
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Like you're a real person.

428
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So yeah, a little bit about like the
interest rate discovery.

429
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
This isn't new to anybody who's used duck
pools or a lot of the other lending

430
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
protocols that exist now, but just a
utilization based.

431
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
For example, my line of credit at my bank
is 7.75%.

432
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So I mean, 8%, hell, I'd borrow all day
on that. Like that wouldn't bother me at

433
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
all.

434
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
If I could get credits and I knew I was
going to earn some more that year and pay

435
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
them off, that's no big deal.

436
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
14%, 20% might be a little iffy, but what
it does is as those rates get higher,

437
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
people add more to the pool like you guys
have seen with duck pools, and then it

438
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
starts pushing the interest rate down
until borrowers go back up.

439
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You just hit that equilibrium.

440
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Decentralize lending pool mechanics. You
guys know the drill if you've used duck

441
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
pools.

442
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But think if you're the hotel. I mean,
you can just start making extra money on

443
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
this, right?

444
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
If you're an independent hotel or
independent franchise is allowed to do it.

445
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Say you're the landscape guy that's
starting up your own company and you don't

446
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
have all the equipment you need, you can
go out and now borrow money in the network

447
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and then go to the Toro dealer that's in
the network and get your equipment.

448
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And again, the local barter exchange is
happy about this because you just created

449
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
more volume for them to pocket 10% or 15%
or whatever it is, and they have more

450
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
members.

451
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Provable reserves, like a centralized
exchange, you don't know.

452
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And some of these have gone under. So you
could build up credits in one of these.

453
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And again, you don't get paid cash,
right? So if I do work under this

454
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
exchange, I get no cash.

455
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It's all in these trade credits. But this
trade organization goes out of business.

456
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I effectively just did work for worse
than free. I paid materials into it too,

457
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
right?

458
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Like not just time and effort, like not
just the variable cost, but everything's

459
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
gone.

460
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So, you could do, you know, again,
provable reserves, you know, that

461
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
everything balances out in these things.

462
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You'd have a dashboard, pretty simple. I
mean, in theory, right? Some UX issues

463
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
there, but.

464
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
There's a fraud case. It's impossible to
inflate reserves if it's actually there on

465
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
chain.

466
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
This would help people if they want to
join the network or trade with the

467
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
network.

468
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You may not want to send your credits to
the Rocky Mountain Network because it

469
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
looks a little dodgy or they're not that
well collateralized.

470
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
There's more on one side than the other
just because of the imbalance that's

471
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
occurring.

472
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Oracle problems, like always, right?
Reputation, time delay, et cetera.

473
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Scalability, user experience. I mean, all
these things, I think, are pretty simple

474
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
to do, but with the right tools and the
right people.

475
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Regulatory. I haven't looked into this
all the way. I don't think that.

476
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
They already do this, right? So like my
exchange and the Ozarks will send money to

477
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
another one.

478
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I don't think that there's a money
transmission license to deal with or

479
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
anything like that, or they already have
that sorted out themselves.

480
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I don't think it really adds a whole lot
of tax reporting complexity.

481
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:48,000
The only thing it would add is 1099 INT
for interest earned on the old lending.

482
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah, and it's in the order of getting a
1099 B.

483
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
So, I mean, you're just giving them one
more data point to give to these people to

484
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
show that you earned interest on your
credits.

485
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Yeah, the bigger issue is adoption,
right? It's always a chicken and egg

486
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
thing.

487
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And so I think it would be starting with
a couple smaller ones that are accessible

488
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
and progressive and then going from there.

489
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yes.

490
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Yeah, so the question was about
algorithmic stablecoins and if it's

491
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
pegging to that, I'm not saying peg it to
the algorithmic stablecoin.

492
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah, if you had local trade partner
credits or dollars and then you had one

493
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
from New York or one from wherever, it's
still in that currency.

494
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You're not co-mingling those pools per
se, right? So like you would set up a

495
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
lending pool for each of those networks.

496
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And then you would give them the ability
to borrow in that network because you want

497
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
to buy Aspen wood from the guy right down
the street or from Joe and tell him to go

498
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
log a couple off his property.

499
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You know, I mean, it's that's sort of the
way it would go.

500
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah. Yeah. So that's why everyone should
want to do it.

501
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Because you can, as the vendor, you can
become your own bank or at least partially

502
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
your own bank, right?

503
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
So like you can now pay. I had this
concept in grad school.

504
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So I used to audit a couple companies
that were small. like they did fishing

505
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
lures.

506
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And then another one that was in Walmart,
right? And they blew up and Walmart blows

507
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
you up to a certain size, like 20, 30
million in sales.

508
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And you're like, woo. And then you have
to go out and get a $20 million loan to

509
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
sustain that.

510
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And then once they know you got that
loan, three months later, they come to you

511
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
and go, you know, I think I'm gonna have
to pay about 50 cents on the dollar, what

512
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I used to pay you.

513
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And like, they just sort of get you
squeezed in. And then on top of that, they

514
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
pay you at 120 days.

515
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
So it's like they're screwing you every
different way.

516
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
But now you can add a concept in grad
school that if Walmart actually became a

517
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
lender to their vendors, they'd make more
money than what they're doing now by

518
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
squeezing everyone for 120 day terms.

519
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
No, it would work like economically it
should work.

520
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So I think this could actually create a
bigger alternative economy when the

521
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
business can become partially their own
line of credit, right?

522
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Like you have free credits or you've
earned credits that now you can lend out.

523
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So anyway,

524
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You know, struggling business most eager
to borrow that gets back to the vetting on

525
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
the front end from the network and the
transaction history they already have on

526
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
these people and sort of bringing that on
chain so that I talked about the

527
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
equilibrium, but you can also put
penalties, right?

528
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Like give them a credit score. And if
your credit score is bad or you're new,

529
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
you have a bad credit score, right?

530
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
When you're 17, 18, 19, you don't have a
good credit score because you haven't

531
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
built up credit, right?

532
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
In theory. And so they could have to pay
an extra 5% or 10% or whatever, right?

533
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
To get the credits.

534
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That's sort of the presentation. So yeah,
they're already operating peer to peer.

535
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So yeah, any other questions? I have a
bunch of just random stuff back here.

536
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Well, no. Yes. So the question is, do you
need a credit score? Yeah.

537
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Well, so what I looked at was
collateralized, right? Because we're

538
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
familiar with duck pools.

539
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
If it's more traditional, like bank-based
on credit scores, then you could hybrid

540
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
it, right?

541
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And they might even be able to onboard
more businesses to the network because now

542
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
you can borrow at a better rate to get
equipment from the Toro dealer or the Ford

543
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
truck dealer, whatever, right?

544
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Like it sort of makes that network even
more powerful in my opinion.

545
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:42,000
But yeah, that's the whole thing. Go
ahead, Chris.

546
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:49,000
So, yeah, so the question is, like, does
tokenizing the credits, like, add a new

547
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:56,000
tax layer for the vendor like Alice or Bob
that we were talking about?

548
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So, I would look at it more like one, I
could be wrong, and I'm wrong every day

549
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:13,000
very often, but I think if you're
providing this service, right, if Alice

550
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:21,000
builds up 40,000 credits,

551
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
she's getting like say she gets paid 40
000 that year for building decks she's

552
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
getting a 1099b from the local trade
partners that you file that 1099b on your

553
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
tax return business tax return or personal
just however you're set up as a

554
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
corporation that flows through is 40 000
of income

555
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Because you have your normal expenses,
you're paying out and Fiat, right?

556
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
So, like, it's already there. It's just
like a receipt.

557
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And so the only thing I'm looking at is
the interest you would be earning would

558
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
then generate a 1099.

559
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Right? Like, you get from a bank showing.
we paid you 0.02% interest this year on

560
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
your cash.

561
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Thanks for parking all your money with
Bank of America."

562
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So it would be that kind of thing. I'm
not looking at it where Alice necessarily

563
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
has, and this is going to sound funny, I'm
not looking at it per se where Alice has

564
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
an Ergo wallet and she has these local
trade partner credit tokens in her wallet.

565
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
were the settlement layer for it.

566
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm not sure if you wouldn't just reskin
Nautilus to where that's all they see is

567
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
like their one thing.

568
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Like I mean just make it its own silo or
even maybe do a side chain for all this. I

569
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
don't know per se.

570
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Well and you would also send out a what's
the one we would also need to send out or

571
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:01,000
we would provide the information to the
local exchange network so that they could.

572
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Give you. The 1099 and maybe 1098 like on
like your home loan.

573
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
This shows the interest you paid, but
it'd be like a interest expense, right?

574
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Like they need to be able to put that on
their tax return. Like, hey, I borrowed

575
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
money and I paid a thousand dollars,
right?

576
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Like they need to be able to put that on
their return.

577
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:46,000
This one. Yeah, we're like, she profits.
So yeah, so it's sort of convoluted.

578
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It's a good example and it's not right
because you're trying to show business and

579
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I showed her get like teeth.

580
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Let's say she bought a, I don't know,
auger attachment for a skid steer, you

581
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,000
know, so she can put in deck poles, right?

582
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Like, I mean, so she can drive them.

583
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Yeah, well, in the auger bit, you know, I
mean, it's several grand, but it depends

584
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
on if you got it new or used.

585
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,000
But so that five grand, she gets
something that is reported to the IRS, and

586
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
then she reports the IRS on her business
tax form that she made $5,000 in income.

587
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It's just like normal income.

588
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
The expense would then be, she keeps
record, like she's getting an invoice,

589
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
you're still getting an invoice showing
payment, right?

590
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
It's just that it got settled in this
non-fiat currency.

591
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And then the extra 10% that she pays the
network, they report something to her

592
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
showing that she paid that fee as well.

593
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So that's also a business deduction.

594
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
No, she built a deck, right? So, she went
out and built a deck for someone, got

595
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
$5,000.

596
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
She gives them an invoice. They pay her
$5,000 in credits.

597
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:57,000
They have the invoice to show that they
paid that expense, right?

598
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So the question is, if banks are already
getting affected by it, does it... How do

599
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I say this? Clearly.

600
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Are they going to take notice and, you
know, is anything we're doing affecting a

601
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
bank?

602
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yeah. If this thing grows because of
this, like, because it becomes more

603
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
attractive to businesses, small and medium
businesses to do this,

604
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Does it affect banks? Possibly. I don't
know. I mean, my family friend that owns

605
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
it, I mean, I don't know, it's like a 50
branch bank.

606
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
He doesn't give a shit about $2 billion.
I mean, like it's not all in his network.

607
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Like it's spread across so many banks,
they don't know they're not getting it

608
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
right now.

609
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I mean, honestly, $2 billion is nothing
to banking system. Like it's nothing.

610
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Yeah, and you said, so what's holding
back this concept?

611
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
A lot of people, I think Joe may have
said it, someone else may have said it as

612
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
well, people are sort of inherently lazy,
right?

613
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
This takes a little bit extra hustle,
right?

614
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
One, it takes you, if you're a barter
member to say, hey, can I pay you in

615
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
barter bucks, right?

616
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And most people feel uncomfortable trying
to do something like that or hustle or

617
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
You know, whatever it's something else to
have to deal with.

618
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And and yeah, so if I do a project and
make like. 810 grand and some guys

619
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
backyard doing this project for them.

620
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
How long am I going to sit on that 10
grand? Like, I better have very low fixed

621
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
costs and very low variable costs because
I might be sitting on that 10 grand for a

622
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
while before I can use it all.

623
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And that's what I think this, to me, it's
a fungibility, like you said, and I think

624
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
it's also a network effect issue.

625
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I mean, none of them have scale, right?
So, I mean, there's always that network

626
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
effect they've done really good so like.

627
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Colorado Springs you guys have been
around here a bit, but it's like 750 like

628
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
MSA, maybe a million like it's a good size
population.

629
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Northwest Arkansas fastest growing. MSA
in the country for multiple years now in a

630
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
row.

631
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Yeah, it's about 750 K now when I was,
you know, like 20 30 years ago, there's

632
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
maybe like 250 people.

633
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Yeah, 250,000 people. So it's

634
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:38,000
If they have about 750,000 in their MSA,
Metropolitan Statistic Association, or

635
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:46,000
area, and they're doing 10 million a year,
those guys are hustling.

636
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
But they're hustling because you saw
they're making 10 percent, right?

637
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
So that's like three people. One of
them's the secretary, one of them's the

638
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
owner, one of them's this business dev guy
splitting a million bucks a year.

639
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
That's pretty good coin, right?

640
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And I'm not saying replace those guys.
They should be getting paid that if

641
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
they're hustling that hard.

642
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:11,000
The guys in Rocky Mountain are doing half
a million a year. Good.

643
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I mean, I think the lending pools is a
big thing. I think there's a, you know,

644
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
the cross network thing is pretty huge.

645
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Making that available, but that's a
chicken egg thing. I think the end network

646
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
lending, I think, is the biggest.

647
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
And I believe why it's also a hurdle is
the software that exists could easily do

648
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
this as well, right?

649
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
This isn't hard, it's a ledger. I mean,
not being nasty to blockchain or Ergo, but

650
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
it's a ledger, right?

651
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
The software is already keeping a ledger,
doing their 1099s.

652
00:49:48,000 --> 00:50:03,000
it's not it's not it's not clear and
transparent right so like why would I lend

653
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:18,000
my bucks out of my account on this network
when I can't see where they're going or

654
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:33,000
anything else right so I mean I think
that's where blockchain trumps the

655
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:48,000
federated or you know closed system yeah

656
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I haven't I haven't right like this sort
of been the back of my head for a while

657
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
and I sort of spit it out the last couple
of days.

658
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:01,000
What are you guys raising your hands here
in the front row? No? Okay.

659
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,000
We'll pay in FAKU. That'll get every dev
running.

660
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Yeah, so the question from Chris was
like, you know, what would it take to

661
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
attract a dev to do this?

662
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I honestly, I don't know. I don't truly
know how complex this is.

663
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
At the end of the day, I think it is
more, and that's why I said it's a non-dev

664
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
dev thing.

665
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I think it's more getting the first
couple exchanges on board with giving you

666
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
the data, right?

667
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Giving you the API access to the data or
whatever the output from their system to

668
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
get that data.

669
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And then what can you do with it?

670
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,000
With the lending pools, I think, one,
two, three, four, five, six, Seven I think

671
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,000
there's seven devs in here that whole side
of the room actually I think any of them

672
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:04,000
could take duck pools and modify it for
this.

673
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I mean or find a way to modify it for
this And so, you know, I mean if you

674
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:19,000
started with that as a proof of concept
right just the lending pool

675
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
So, I mean, I think, again, to Joe's
earlier point today of we strive for open

676
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
protocols for a reason.

677
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I think this is a good bolt-on reason. I
mean, it's sort of segued into what I was

678
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
talking about.

679
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
But, I mean, I think anybody in here that
I'm looking at that's devs on this side,

680
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
they're all way more talented than
anything I would come up with or even want

681
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
to teach someone, you know.

682
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I mean, they can modify that stuff. It's
there.

683
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I mean, some of the back end maybe isn't
or, you know, some of the front end stuff

684
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
we'd have to develop.

685
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
But I mean, some of it's sort of there in
a way.

686
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Yeah, so that's a good question. So what
is the what piece of the pie is for the

687
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
dev?

688
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
The existing software that I said, like
several the more modern exchanges or ones

689
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
that have decent websites and whatnot.

690
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I mean, it's sort of like a, if you want
to think of Zoho or, or, like Salesforce,

691
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
like CRM, like it's a CRM basically with
this bolted onto it, but a guy's built it

692
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
from scratch.

693
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Like it's not, I've sort of looked at it
enough to see that at least I believe it's

694
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
not like a existing CRM package.

695
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,000
It's what he's built from scratch.

696
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I don't know what he charges for that
software. I've tried to find out. It's

697
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
obviously not published.

698
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
There's not a lot of customers for it,
right?

699
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
So if it's one dev and he's charging five
grand a year to, you know, I don't know,

700
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
40, 50 customers.

701
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I mean, that's a pretty good nut and he
can do other stuff because now he just has

702
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
a spinning top, right, without a whole lot
of, you know, moving parts going forward.

703
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,000
So what this would earn or yield, I mean,
to me, it's more, it's going to have to be

704
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:13,000
built at cost to figure out how to
monetize it.

705
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Like, I don't know if it's earning off
the lending pool. I don't know if it's a

706
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
fee to the networks.

707
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
They're already paying a fee to this guy.
Does he try to replicate it?

708
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
You know, like, I mean, there's a couple
moving parts, so I don't have a good

709
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
answer for that because I really haven't
taken that step in my head because I was

710
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
still just, you know, noodling around with
the research.

711
00:55:38,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Yeah, Luke.

712
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Yeah, so the question is, can you chicken
an egg?

713
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
And do you do you try to replicate the
software for one and get others to join,

714
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
you know, for interoperability across the
networks?

715
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I really don't think so. I think it's a
can of worms.

716
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I mean, right now it's a one guy show
owns the somebody built a new one out of

717
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Detroit like a couple years ago, he bought
them out and just here's your money.

718
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Let's combo it up, right? Like let's I
don't want competition.

719
00:56:49,000 --> 00:57:05,000
It's an oligopoly or a complete monopoly.

720
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Yeah, maybe. I mean, there's a lot of
ways to skin it, but

721
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Yeah, no, this was just more just to get
people thinking about. I mean, to me, the

722
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:20,000
biggest thing is it is a group that's
already organized, already licensed.

723
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
They're not doing anything shady, and
they're not using Fiat to the tune of 2.5

724
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
billion a year.

725
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Is it a sales problem, dev problem? I
think for them scaling, it's always going

726
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:53,000
to be a network effect problem.

727
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
It's a super interesting because it's
like proof of work itself is most

728
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
profitable when you have excess capacity,
whether of energy or of computational

729
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
power, right?

730
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,000
And so networks like this potentially
allow people to redirect excess capacity

731
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:17,000
in whatever skill set they have and in
essence tokenize it.

732
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Turn it into credit. Now, there's always
like the human element where it's like,

733
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
okay, if I'm a restaurant and my excess
capacity is my old shit, is it lower

734
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
quality?

735
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Right? And then it's like, okay, how do
you create the right enforcement

736
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
mechanisms?

737
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
You know, some systems I would say
probably are a little bit aggressive in

738
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
terms of like, maybe they have credit
limits in terms of how much you can spend

739
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
or where or fees or whatever.

740
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:56,000
But, you know, we do see a lot of the
quote unquote gig economy that is

741
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:03,000
basically people trying to take excess
capacity and turn it into credit.

742
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
So it's a super interesting idea, you
know, in terms of how to coordinate like

743
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
on the organic side, I have no idea.

744
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I'm the wrong person, but as, as a net
idea, it's quite fascinating.

745
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Yeah. And I would, the only thing I would
add to that is it is that excess capacity

746
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
in the gig economy is growing.

747
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
So, I mean, I would say that was, A lot
of
