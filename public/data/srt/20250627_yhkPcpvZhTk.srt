1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right, let me see if I can see us
online here.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Test, test, test.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We are going bootleg here.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, I think I see us right here.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yep, I think we're online.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yep, let me just post it.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
All right, why don't you go back and talk
about Dexy while I post these.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All right, so are we online?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yep, we should be.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
All right, so yeah, please check Dexy. It
should be considered as a funny financial

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
game at this point, like, I don't know,
maybe HODL coin. But yeah, well, also

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
sometimes you can get quick profit from
arbitrage, right?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Who made Crystal Pools? Can you talk
about that? What does that exactly do?

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
C8. So Crystal Pool is a DEX aggregator.
So you can work with many liquidity pools,

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
SigmaUSD Bank, Dexy Bank from the single
application. And yeah, that's quite a cool

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
idea, I think.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So that means, so it's kind of like Dex
Hunter, those kinds of things where it

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
finds the best price for you.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But here you also can interact with many
applications from one UI. I don't know

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
much about Dex Hunter, so these days I'm
using Ergo DeFi. I don't know much about

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Dex Hunter, all that stuff. Yeah, well,
Crystal Pool is quite cool. It's still

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
raw, but it's getting better and better.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, yeah, well, and the plan is to update
Oracle Pool to version 2, use the Oracle

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Pool and then launch Gluon USD, so Bruno.
Bruno, Bruno. Such plan. And then DexyUSD,

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
yeah, so probably around September or
something like that, because we need for

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
some time to update the Oracle Pool first
and the testnet. Then in the mainnet and

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
so on so it takes some time but some weeks
even. But then yeah, we can have DexyUSD

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
so it would be good also to find some
liquidity providers right now. Yeah, so

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
also going to work on that.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And then, yeah, so with all those things,
so Rosen is also going to bring some USD

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
stables from Ethereum. Decentralized ones,
uncensorable, let's say. So, yeah, would

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
be quite good. And then, yeah, we need
stable to stable pools. So if you can do

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
such stuff, it's the right time to do.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
All right, I think I saved all the
questions from before the internet

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
toasting. So should we start hitting
those? I'll read them to you since you

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
can't see them. Sound good?

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yep. So, let's, but maybe you have some
news from your side.

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Some what?

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
News from your side.

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, you're right. I totally forgot. Yeah.
Yeah, guys. So there's something cool that

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
we're going to, the info team is going to
be doing. And when I say info team, I

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
mean, me and kushti and OnVR in the chat.

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So the idea is that we have currently, we
have a main Ergo platform website, right?

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's Ergo docs. We have Sigma verse, but
we have the main Ergo platform website

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
where Athena's hosted that kind of stuff.
And we have the Explorer, which is

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
ergoplatform.org.

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So how that works is that goes to a load
balancer in Cloudflare. And that actually

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
goes to three separate servers that are
running on a hosted platform that is paid

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
for by the EF, right? So in interest of,
you know, we all know the EF doesn't have

50
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
an endless budget. They're not going to be
around forever. So in the interest of

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
actually taking that burden off, paying
for that infrastructure, we're going to

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
try something different.

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And what that means is we've already,
I've already started building three new

54
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
nodes on 6.1. I built them on 5.13 the
other day, and I just updated them to 6.1,

55
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
which is the rocks database, which loves
SSDs nice and fast. Once that is done, I'm

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
going to overlay Explorer on top of them
as well, which is GraphQL API, as well as

57
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
the web-based Explorer that you're used to
seeing. Once that's settled and working

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
well, I am going to add those all to the
load balancer. And then slowly, we'll

59
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
start removing the hosted ones from it.

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And now you may be saying, okay, QX,
what's the difference between you hosting

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
three nodes, you know, an internet place
with, you know, same similar uptime as

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Hetzner or wherever they're hosted, if
they're still the same place, still the

63
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
same provider. Well, that's where this
comes into play.

64
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
put two or three of these machines that

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm using to host - they're 16 gigabyte
RAM, i7, one terabyte hard drives with

66
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
about 5,000 megabytes read write speed on
the NVMe. So they're really fast. They

67
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
should be able to be very suitable for
this. I'm going to put them on MewMart. If

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
you guys aren't familiar with MewMart, I'm
going to talk to HQ if he's listening now.

69
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm going to only allow a certain token to
be able to buy it.

70
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And then I'm going to decide who gets
those, depending on your interest and your

71
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
internet availability, your internet
connection, your static IP, your somewhat

72
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
limited amount of dev knowledge. You don't
have to be a dev, but you have to be able

73
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
to be able to jump into Docker and TMUX
and run nodes and explorers. And the idea

74
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
is that we want to spread three or four of
these puppies around the globe. And we're

75
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
going to add those as well to the load
balancer so that Cloudflare will see the

76
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
three machines that I have, and then they
will see the three machines or four

77
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
machines spread around the globe.

78
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So then we'll have a load balance of
five, six machines spread around the

79
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
globe. So if all three of mine go down,
then we still have those three or four

80
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
hosting the same Explorer experience for
you guys. So that's on top of Nautilus

81
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
putting direct IPs into these rollovers
for the API and the GraphQL and the

82
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Explorer.

83
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So you'll hit one link,
explorer.ergoplatform, which will go to my

84
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
ones. It'll go to these three or four or
five locally hosted by these people who

85
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
have good internet connections that
volunteer to do it. And will be much more

86
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
of a decentralized kind of central node
hosting, if you want to call it. Everybody

87
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
wants to go to the main Explorer kind of
thing. So we're going to be able to do

88
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
that. Let's do that decentralized manner,
and let's not have it rely on funding from

89
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
the EF. We'll have it rely on volunteers
that want to do it themselves, which I

90
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
think is ethos of Ergo.

91
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So we're probably about a month away from
maybe a full switch over for that. But

92
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
keep an eye out. If you're interested in
running an explorer slash node that's

93
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
official and through the load balancer,
give me a buzz. We'll talk about it. Maybe

94
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll hand you a token if I approve and
you'll be able to get that swapped out on

95
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
MewMart for the shipping fee as well added
to that depending on where you are. Great,

96
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
so I think that's cool, kushti. We finally
get off that kind of thing and get to

97
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
fully, even though it's an official
explorer.ergoplatform, we can still target

98
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
community nodes and community load
balancers. So I think that'll be cool.

99
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah, sounds good. Would be happy to
participate.

100
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh, great. Right, right, right. You got
one too. Fantastic. That'll be great.

101
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
All right. Let's jump on the questions.

102
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So we've got Mathis Bori. He's saying, I
think he's saying, he's still trying to

103
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
figure out Ergo adds new stuff so quickly.
I guess he's trying to figure out how Ergo

104
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
adds stuff so quickly. Well, I can speak
from my own experience that the tooling

105
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
here on Ergo is absolutely fantastic for
the most part to be able to dive in at

106
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
different levels, whether I want to use a
full SDK in Scala, or I want to go into

107
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
something much easier like Python.

108
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Or there's even, if Paul's watching too,
he's tried to bring the app kit over to C

109
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
sharp, I believe it was as well. So
there's lots of different options for

110
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
interacting with chain. And not only that,
but the end points are so easy to use. You

111
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
can spin up a node really fast yourself,
do a full index node, and if the API

112
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
endpoints aren't in that full index node
that you need, you can rely on Explorer or

113
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
you can say, screw it, we're just going to
interact directly with a Postgres database

114
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that Explorer is keeping on top of the
index nodes.

115
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So I've done both. It's very easy to
interact with that kind of thing. So at

116
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
least from a dev standpoint, that's a huge
turn on for that. But kushti can speak

117
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
more to how he's so fast at dropping node
updates all the time, as well as, you

118
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
know, sub-block integrations and cool
stuff that you announce every so often.

119
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah, well, actually, it would be good to
have more contributors to move faster

120
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:10,000
because I think it's possible. So, yeah,
well, I think it's about community, right?

121
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So, well, a lot of developers, a lot of
independent efforts. Well, we need FOMO. I

122
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:28,000
think, well, what do we have now?
Structure-wise, it's quite friendly to

123
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:37,000
scale it up. So, yeah, let's move faster.
Like, hypersonic speed. Why not?

124
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Let me see if I can bring up text here,
kushti. I think I can put questions on the

125
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:07,000
screen makeshift-wise.

126
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hi, kushti.

127
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Alice project.

128
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So, just the title and, yeah, I've put it
into the reading list, so, yeah, I guess I

129
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:56,000
can provide some comments before Monday,
yeah, so, yeah, it's in the reading list.

130
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But, yeah, well, still need to read it
fully, right, but, yeah, well, I think,

131
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:18,000
well, at least from the title, the first
page a bit. Yeah, well, why not? So I

132
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:29,000
think it's time to think about starting to
build something like that.

133
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But yeah, well, I can provide maybe
comments on the forum. Let's see,

134
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
actually. Yeah, we will have anniversary
AMA, right? So I can provide some thoughts

135
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
there, if not on the forum before,
because, well, next days are busy. But

136
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,000
yeah, well, anniversary AMA is also good.

137
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And by the way, what time for AMA is it
said, you know, if Joe's coming, maybe

138
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
it'll be maybe it'll be an hour later.
We'll see.

139
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
One hour is okay.

140
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
One hour is okay for you. So maybe two PM
UTC. Let's do two PM UTC for AMA on the

141
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
1st of July, the kickoff of the
anniversary.

142
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah, sounds good.

143
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And this Aletheia protocol, yeah, so I
found it over Twitter yesterday. So yeah,

144
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,000
well, I didn't have time to check in
details, but yeah, well, we'll do in the

145
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,000
next few days. Very cool. All right. So
yeah, so many. And it seems it's some new

146
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,000
author also writes some. I don't know,
maybe some anonymous guy, some new account

147
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:05,000
in the GitHub also. I don't know. Let's
see. Interesting.

148
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
All right. Let's see. We got another
question, kushti. How can a privacy chain

149
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
still aggregate statistics like Gini
coefficient, allowing users to evaluate

150
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
the market without sacrificing TX and
wallet balance privacy? That's a question

151
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
from Ursa Minor 2010.

152
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah, but this is, I guess, nearly
impossible, right? So if you want to have

153
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
some Gini coefficient for private chain
where every balance is private. I know, I

154
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
mean theoretically there could be
solutions for like MPC, but practically

155
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
not. Really not, because yeah, you don't
have participants which are willing to

156
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
participate in such a procedure, right?
Probably. It's not quite realistic to

157
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
bring them into this MPC protocol,
multi-party computation protocol. That's

158
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
what I can think about.

159
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You can also have, I don't know, some
centralized party gathering statistics and

160
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
participants sending some zero-knowledge
proofs without revealing all the data.

161
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah, it's also probably not very
realistic setting, right? Because if you

162
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
have, for example, the richest wallet in
the ecosystem, probably you wouldn't trust

163
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,000
all this ZK, blah, blah, blah, and the
centralized party gathering statistics

164
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
anyway, right? So, well, theoretically,
it's possible maybe, but practically, I'm

165
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
pretty sure not quite.

166
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
All right, let's see what else we have,
kushti. We have, this is from our buddy

167
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Aco. He wants to say, can you give a
little teaser about your call you'll be

168
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
having with Midnight? What's it about?
Ooh, I miss this. What's this talk about?

169
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh, so it's from some, not so public chat
maybe, but yeah. There will be some call

170
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:48,000
in coming days, but yeah, about what is it
about? So there is some plan, right, but

171
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:58,000
it's probably quite obvious. Well, there
is interest from both sides, right? So for

172
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Ergo side, we are quite interested in
privacy, right, in regards with maybe kind

173
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:18,000
of private side chain, right, to have some
private contracts, right? So the idea is

174
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:28,000
that you can transfer ERGs and then have
some private contract. But then, yeah,

175
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:38,000
well, there is some interest from Midnight
side in regards with proof of work aspects

176
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:48,000
and so on. So let's see what can we do
together.

177
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Well, is that like, are you talking about
like integrating or like, I remember

178
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Charles said on Twitter at one point, when
somebody asked him, he's like, oh, Ergo

179
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
can just become a partner chain. And
that's how Ergo can be integrated with

180
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Midnight at some point. Is that what
you're speaking about?

181
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah, well, in regards to the partner
chain, so I made a tweet yesterday that,

182
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
yeah, you can actually do some options
like a merge mined side chain of Ergo,

183
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
which is a partner chain of Cardano,
right, and well, another option is double

184
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,000
merge mined sidechain, for example, merge
mined sidechain of both Bitcoin and Ergo.

185
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
To, yeah, well, use Ergo as a kind of
smart layer of Bitcoin with less trust

186
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,000
assumptions, right, if there is support
for some Bitcoin.

187
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So, how does that work if we are dumping
like the full chain from Cardano onto into

188
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Ergo blocks on a side chain? Are we just
like dumping hashes or proofs that

189
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
calculate out to whatever the result is on
the other chain? How does that kind of

190
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
work?

191
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah, so it's about reusing validators
from Cardano, right? And yeah, for this,

192
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:31,000
there is no need to know about the state
of the chain, I guess, because they have

193
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:39,000
some protocols for light clients, right? I
forgot the name. And yeah, it probably can

194
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,000
be reused. I guess that's the plan in the
context of Cardano sidechains as well,

195
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:55,000
right? Which is actually quite interesting
because for most proof of stake chains,

196
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:03,000
well, there are no such techniques, even
to the best of my knowledge. So, yeah,

197
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:11,000
well, then, yeah, it's quite interesting,
right? And, well, then, yeah, you can do

198
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:19,000
some interesting things also, right, when
you have consensus from both Cardano

199
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:27,000
validators and subset of Cardano
validators and subset of Ergo miners.

200
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So you say, but that's not going to
technically make Cardano any more secure,

201
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
adding proof of work that way, right?
Because we're still relying on the

202
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
proof-of-stake validation techniques in
Cardano. We're just writing it to our

203
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
chain, no?

204
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah, so for sidechain, yeah, it's just
for sidechain concerns, right? But yeah,

205
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:00,000
well, you will have somewhat better
security budget, right, for both chains,

206
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Cardano and Ergo, because of merge mined
side chain. Yeah, it would make consensus

207
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:18,000
more secure for both sides.

208
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yeah, this is actually quite interesting
direction to discover, I guess.

209
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
All right, there's another question for
you, kushti. kushti, when are we going to

210
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
see you in a more relaxed podcast, more to
hear about the story of Ergo? I think

211
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
people want to see you. Ace Pickle says,
kushti on Rogan. Maybe they want to see

212
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
you smoking a fat joint, kushti, and just
talking with squinty eyes.

213
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
All right. So yeah, about history of
Ergo. I don't know. So maybe I need to

214
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
write down some things first. Because,
well, the history is not quite known,

215
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
probably, right? Many actors are now quite
forgotten. Some are not alive,

216
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,000
unfortunately, even, right? Like Alex.
Skalakhan.

217
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Yeah, so, well, actually, it was mostly
about engineers, right? Like, doing

218
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:42,000
something and dreaming about something.
So, well, it wasn't probably... So, even

219
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Monero, for example, was different, right?
So, well, in this regard, it could be

220
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:04,000
comparable with Bitcoin early days, very
early days. Bitcoin of 2009, right, when

221
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:15,000
there were only engineers, there were no
marketing folks. Like Ergo before 2020.

222
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And then, yeah, well, somehow we got,
well, some people doing marketing,

223
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:37,000
enthusiasts, and yeah, well, all the
community we have now.

224
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So yeah, that's quite amazing. Because
usually, these days, it's quite opposite,

225
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:59,000
right? So first, you get marketing folks,
funding, all the hype. And then somehow,

226
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
maybe you hire engineers who actually in
most cases, hate the jobs they're doing.

227
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Quite opposite story.

228
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
All right, let's see. We got another
question, kushti, banging these out.

229
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Another one from Ursa Minor trying to get
a grasp on things like Midnight. Can

230
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
privacy stablecoin exist on a Sigma chain
with proof of reserves and collateral on

231
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Ergo? They're just trying to understand
how people trust privacy chains like

232
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Midnight.

233
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Yeah, so recently discussed with Bruno
stuff like that, like privacy stable coin,

234
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,000
right? So there is a private instantiation
of a djed protocol called Zephyr. I don't

235
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,000
know. So I think that they got into some
issues at some point because of some bugs.

236
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And so on, so yeah, I wouldn't recommend
to use it without research and so on,

237
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
because yeah, I don't actually know much
about it.

238
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But yeah, so from what I know, so it's
some fork of Monero, but with djed,

239
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:33,000
basically SigmaUSD with some modifications
implemented in the core of the chain,

240
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:43,000
right, and for stuff like that, definitely
it's better to just build, I don't know,

241
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:53,000
some private side chain, right, and bring
SigmaUSD, so, well, transparently-ish and

242
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:03,000
already known stablecoin, right, or Dexy,
Gluon, whatever to this chain, right, and

243
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:13,000
then enjoy, well, privacy there, right? It
would be simpler and more secure option.

244
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
All right. Let's see what else we got,
kushti, we've got...

245
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
One more question, maybe. Time to run? Or
do you have to run?

246
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I've got a minute or two. Byron says, if
kushti smokes, I'll buy another 1,000 ERG

247
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,000
next week. Guys, we want a good 6.01 node.
We don't want security vulnerabilities in

248
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
the node next time.

249
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
All right, let's see, we got, oh yeah,
we've got this. Byron also asks, any

250
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
updates on the meetup plan? It's funny you
should say that. The meetup planning for

251
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Ergo. It's funny you should say that. We
just had a Sunday meeting last week where

252
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
we kind of mostly finalized the schedule
and I threw it in chat. Joe and I went

253
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
over it pretty hard, and then I threw it
in the main segment of the chat and asked

254
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
for feedback. And I don't think there are
many changes.

255
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So later today, expect the meetup
schedule and speakers and how it's going

256
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:40,000
to stream to everybody on Twitter, as well
as the GitHub and the Google signup link.

257
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You'll see that if you're interested in
coming and doing a meetup with us, then

258
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:00,000
please come out to sunny Colorado Springs.
I don't think the hotels are too pricey. I

259
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:10,000
did a lot of looking at Airbnb and it's
weird Colorado Springs is the only place

260
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I've seen where there's going to be some
good speakers and a live hackathon, a good

261
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:30,000
hike at Garden of the Gods, and you'll
meet people in person that you just see in

262
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:40,000
chats kind of thing.

263
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So great, looking forward to that.
kushti, you promised once July rolls

264
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
around, you're going to go to the
consulate and see if you can get here,

265
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
right?

266
00:29:49,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah, so probably. Yeah, around July 2nd
to 10th. Yeah, it will be known.

267
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Yeah. Oh, here's a good one from Mark the
Shark. I don't think you've ever seen this

268
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
before, what it looks like, what changes
he did. I think there are minimal changes

269
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
to the node. But what would happen if
Cheese started just putting storage rent

270
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
stuff into the actual official node?

271
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Yeah, well, I don't know how I haven't
seen.

272
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah, I'll talk to Cheese about that.
That's a great idea, Mark. Let's have

273
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Cheese see what it's like and maybe he can
put some pull requests in the official

274
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
node, kushti. Is that something you'd be
willing to consider?

275
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Yeah, let's see. So I need to check
modifications.

276
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
As long as it doesn't break anything
else, right? That'd be nice and easy.

277
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Because the way that the SIGs pool are
running it is we run a modified node, we

278
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
run a modified mining core. And we run the
storage rent application itself, which is

279
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
a script.

280
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So we run three things at the SIGs mining
pool. Most big pools are most likely not

281
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
running mining core. They're probably just
running stratum, so their own version kind

282
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
of thing. So they'll only need the
modified node and the storage rent kind of

283
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
thing, like Herominers, I doubt runs
mining core. Yeah, so putting the node

284
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
just like turnkey would be amazing if
Cheese could integrate his code into the

285
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
official releases. Then we could just
continue to stay up to date with the nodes

286
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
and mining pools could as well. And
there'd be nothing we'd have to really do

287
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
separately or wait for a sub release of
that once like 6.0 or 6.1 came out.

288
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Awesome. All right, great. Well, Mark
suggest that to Cheese. Ping him. Ping

289
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
him, Mark. Ping him now. Let's see, one
more question we've got here, unless they

290
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
keep coming. Here we go, kushti. It is
from Byron. What were the thoughts behind

291
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
twin coins, and is that something still in
the works down the line? Maybe Armeanio?

292
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Twincoin. Twincoin was a paper I've done
along with Professor Hong Shengzhou from

293
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Virginia Commonwealth University. It's
actually a little bit theoretical result,

294
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:37,000
so to make it practical, we need to modify
it. Basically, the idea is to have one

295
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:45,000
proof-of-stake block after one
proof-of-work block, such a block

296
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:53,000
structure and yeah, to make it practical,
I believe we need to do more so it would

297
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:01,000
be like, I don't know, sub-blocks, but
proof of stake based sub-blocks,

298
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:09,000
basically, right?

299
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So you generate, well, blocks via proof
of work and then yeah, via proof of stake,

300
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:31,000
you decide who will generate sub-blocks in
between blocks. Something like that, but

301
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:41,000
then, yeah, well, the whole security
analysis needs to be redone. And yeah,

302
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:51,000
well, so the main motivation was to show
some security against 50 plus percent

303
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:01,000
attack, which is actually achieved. But
yeah, well, aside of that, the protocol

304
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:11,000
proposed is not very practical, not very
efficient.

305
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
No, because you're using another
resource, right, so you use proof-of-work

306
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
along with proof-of-stake, so you need to
have both, right, not just proof-of-work

307
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
in order to write a chain suffix. So yeah,
then it actually provides better security.

308
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
But yeah, well, again, to make it
practical, there is need for more

309
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
efficient construction.

310
00:34:45,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So yeah, well, maybe there is a need for
such a chain, but yeah, I think currently

311
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:15,000
there are more actual requests, rights,
demands, options to implement. Well, even,

312
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:30,000
for example, a private stablecoin, right?
So, well, it would be more appealing

313
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:45,000
probably because, well, currently, well,
in regards with consensus, there are a lot

314
00:35:45,000 --> 00:36:00,000
of options implemented, but, yeah, I
think, well, for real-world adoption, so

315
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:15,000
you need for a little bit different things
maybe in the first place at this point.

316
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I said that, what's it called? Thanks for
joining everybody. Sorry about the

317
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
downtime. I said that's a beauty of Ergo
and the decentralized nature, even on

318
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
things like this where Andy's connection,
who's the broadcaster all the time, goes

319
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
down, there's the ability for somebody
else. Like I just had to push a couple

320
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
buttons and set us up in OBS and we're
live again. It's hard to kill the voice of

321
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Ergo or the Ergo stream or the Ergo
blockchain at all. So super, super cool

322
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
that we can just keep on cranking this
stuff out no matter what.

323
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
All right, kushti, any last words?

324
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:12,000
All right, all right. So see you,
everyone, around Ergoversary. And yeah,

325
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,000
busy days, but that's quite ordinary
state, right, of things. See you around

326
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Ergoversary. So the summer is hot. And
yeah, well, after the really hot season...

327
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Yeah, put those mining rigs in the
basements, guys. Don't have them up on

328
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
your main floor.

329
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yeah, well, keep in touch.
