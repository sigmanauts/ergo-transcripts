00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hi everyone, it's Josemi and in this
video I'm going to present Beene, a proof

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
of funding platform designed to support
projects in raising funds and fairly

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
rewarding their contributions.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So, Beene enables any project to receive
funding from the community and

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
automatically distributes proof of funding
tokens to contributors in real time.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
These tokens serve as contribution
accounting tokens, providing who

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
contributed and how much.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Here's how the platform works.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Project owners create a funding vault and
define the funding token, for example,

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
ERG, a minimum funding goal, a deadline,
the proof of funding token to distribute

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and a rate of how many proof tokens are
given per funding token.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Once a vault is created, project owners
can add or remove reward tokens.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Contributors can deposit any amount of
funding tokens and they immediately

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
receive proof of funding token vouchers
that represent their proof of funding

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
tokens.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So if the funding goal is reached, the
project owner can withdraw the funds and

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
contributors can exchange their funding
token vouchers with the same amount of

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
funding tokens.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And if the goal isn't reached by the
deadline, contributors can return their

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
proof of funding token vouchers and
recover their contributions.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So let's visualize this on a chart where
the horizontal axis is time and the

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
vertical axis is the amount of funding
token raised.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So you can see the actions that become
available depending on whether the goal

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
has been reached or the deadline has
passed.

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So let's see a real example. We used
Beene to raise funds for Gluon Gold.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So the team needed 5,000 ERG to develop
an SDK. A vault was created with a goal of

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:28,000
5,000 ERGs at a rate of one Gluon per ERG
and a two-week deadline.

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Once the goal was met, contributors had
already received their Gluons and the

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
project owner could immediately access the
funds.

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Another example could be a group that
wants to write between 5 and 20 articles

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:03,000
about Ergo, where each article costs 100
ERG.

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So they might call their token the Ergo
Articles Token and create a vault with a

33
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:32,000
goal of 500 ERGs, a rate of 1 EAT per ERG,
and a deadline of 2 weeks.

34
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And after reaching 500 ERGs, the team
starts writing articles. And if the

35
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:55,000
community is happy, more people contribute
and more tokens get distributed so they

36
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:06,000
can even increase the vault capacity to
support up to 100 articles, for example.

37
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Now a cautionary example. A team promises
something revolutionary and asks for 5

38
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:30,000
million ERGs with a flashy token reward,
called SuperDuper Blockchain Token.

39
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And after one week, they raise 3 million
ERGs. But the project is exposed as

40
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
nonsense because it's only a soup of
buzzwords.

41
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So thanks to Beene's rules, because the
minimum amount of 5 million ERGs was not

42
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
raised after the deadline, contributors
can return their proof of funding tokens,

43
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:14,000
the SuperDuper Blockchain Token, and get
their ERG back.

44
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So Beene can be used in many ways. One
can be donations, where proof tokens

45
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
represent your support to a cause.

46
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Another use case can be crowdfunding,
where proof tokens can be exchanged for

47
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
goods later.

48
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Startup funding, selling tokens at a
fixed price. Event tickets, where proof of

49
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:02,000
funding tokens act as tickets to an event
with a minimum and maximum capacity.

50
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And collaborative projects or
benefactions - that is the original use

51
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,000
case that made us develop this platform.

52
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So this idea of working together on
different projects and where labor and

53
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
capital to these projects are both
rewarded equally with contribution

54
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
accounting tokens.

55
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay, so this is the landing page for the
project. We have implementations on

56
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Ethereum and on Ergo.

57
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:08,000
There is some basic information about it,
links to social media. Both projects are

58
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:19,000
open source and available on GitHub.

59
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So the Beene on Ergo implementation is a
web app. It's only running with observers

60
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
only in the browser and connecting
directly to the Ergo blockchain.

61
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It makes it slower but more fault
tolerant too.

62
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There are some projects. This is the
Gluon Gold security audit that we realized

63
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
a few months ago.

64
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay, so let's create a project to show
it. So for example, this PFT project will

65
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:26,000
be our PFT. Let's put this amount of PFT,
the exchange rate of this, the minimum of,

66
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:40,000
for example, half and one day limit, so
the deadline will be tomorrow at the same

67
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:54,000
time.

68
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Test project. So for the creation it
needs two transactions.

69
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Okay, now we can sign the transaction,
the second transaction, and this

70
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:56,000
transaction will create our Beene project.

71
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Okay, so the transaction is confirmed.
Now we can check it, reloading the

72
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:40,000
projects.

73
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Demo test project. So it's only 23 hours
for the deadline. So we are the owners of

74
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:58,000
this project too.

75
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So we can see these actions. We could add
PFT tokens or withdraw them. So for

76
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
example if we want to block more
contributions we could extract the amount

77
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
that is currently on the contract. But now
as users, as contributors, we are going to

78
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:30,000
contribute.

79
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So there are 0.6 PFTs, so we are going to
contribute with 1. We are going to get 0.1

80
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:08,000
contributions, sending this amount of
ERGs.

81
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And we will get an auxiliary token, the
PFT voucher. This token will serve to us

82
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
as the voucher to get the PFT token after
the deadline if the minimum amount is

83
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
raised.

84
00:13:30,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Okay, the contribution transaction is
confirmed. So we can reload the project.

85
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Perfect, so we can see now that there is
some contribution and it's not at minimum.

86
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So for now, when the deadline is reached,
we should be able to refund our ERGs.

87
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And that's it. So follow us on social
media, join our channels and get in touch

88
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
if you would like to work with us. Thanks
for watching.
