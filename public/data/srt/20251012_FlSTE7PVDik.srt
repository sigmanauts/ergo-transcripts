1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
All right. Everybody that came in person,
thank you for coming. It's pretty cool to

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
see a little group of people focused on
the same thing. Ultimately, peer-to-peer

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
networks kind of replicate real life where
your community, people you know, people

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
you exchange with kind of create the basis
for everything in your life, right?

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And that's one of the really interesting
things about decentralized systems, is

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that on one hand you have like technical
parameters, but on the other hand you have

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
a social system. And kind of like any
social system you have various levels of

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
like trust, sometimes you could call that
belief. And in the extreme, I would even

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
say it's healthy to have an element of
faith in each other, people in your

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
networks.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now that is both something that can offer
a lot of benefits. It can allow you entry

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
into a peer-to-peer system, but it's also
something that is an attack vector, right?

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If you have people that kind of exploit
your trust or your belief or your

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
emotions, that doesn't always end well.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I had a presentation put together to kind
of cover the basis of Ergo itself. And

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
then I was thinking last night, everybody
here anyway, and many people that are

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
probably tuning in already know these
things, right? So what is the point of

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
just repeating, I don't know, what's
publicly available, and anybody with some

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
time, energy, or desire can easily read?

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Now I know that's somewhat of a skill
that's being lost, is the ability to read,

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
but it's there, right?

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I do think it's fascinating kind of the
events of yesterday, right? So let's just

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
speak to the moment. Yesterday I was out
having some beer and some food with some

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
of the people that showed up completely
oblivious to, you know, the workings of

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
kind of the broader crypto ecosystem and
you come back and they're like, oh, you

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
know, there's been a spiral effect of
deleveraging and, you know, billions have

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
been removed from the market and what's
happening and all these people I don't

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
know, hopefully manage their risk, right?

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
A good starting point is understanding
like risk management and leverage.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Leverage is a powerful tool when it's
needed, right? But it's also risky. It's

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
not without its trade-offs. And I think
that sometimes you have the talking heads

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
in the crypto industry that do not like to
talk about risk. And I think that's a

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
fundamental failure of the cryptocurrency
ecosystem broadly.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Because ultimately in our world, money is
a control system, right? We live, let's

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
say, within the United States. You have a
group of people on a hill somewhere, they

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
say, right? And they go into a room and
they discuss in private. Okay, publicly

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
they'll say we have two parameters. We
want to have employment at a certain

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
level. We want to have inflation at a
certain level.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And those two don't necessarily correlate
in terms of how they move anyway, right?

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But they go into a room in secret and
everybody around the world gathers and

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
watches. Say, what are they going to do
with our money? What is going to be the

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
cost of money? And we sit around and
speculate and sometimes people have fun on

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
polymarket or whatever.

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And eventually smoke comes out of the
chimney and we say, okay, this is our new

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
updated policy. They forked the network,
so to speak, and this is going to be the

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
cost of money. And we go through this
ritual, you know, regularly, people around

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
the world tune in and watch and position
and try to kind of front run whatever that

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
trusted setup is going to be.

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And then on a higher level we have this
idea of, let's call it the type of

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
cross-chain tariff, right? Where
arbitrarily you have new costs added to

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
the system. That's, I guess, what was a
part of the madness yesterday, more or

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
less. Let's see. Where suddenly, you know,
you have these two economies that interact

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and we're going to add a hundred percent
tariff, right?

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And there's no real consensus mechanism
to understand what is coming, right? It's

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
a trusted system where the individual has
very little power. They have very little

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
power in terms of understanding what the
assumption is today and what the

57
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
assumptions are going to be tomorrow. And
that's not the type of environment that

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
produces I don't know, the right mindset
for risk itself, right?

59
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And that's one of the most interesting
things about this idea that started with

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Bitcoin is saying, okay, can we have a
system where the parameters are set?

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Right? Where monetary policy is more or
less set, and then build economy on top of

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
set expectations. And based on how the
network is set up, within a certain set of

63
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
assumptions, you can assume honesty.
That's powerful.

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
If you look at kind of the traditional
system that we're all born into, it's

65
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
something we just naturally inherit. It
changes depending on where you're from,

66
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
right? But it's kind of more or less the
same system where you have high

67
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
concentration of power and then of course
one of the most profitable things is to be

68
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
close to power, right? Close to where
money is being distributed from and

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
generally the further away you get from
that initial distribution point of money,

70
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
the more inflation and expansion of money
supply tends to hit, right?

71
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I would say a lot of the crypto industry
has really gotten away from first

72
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
principles. And in my opinion, that's
based on toxic social systems. Because

73
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
that social system is inherent to these
type of networks. Where you constantly

74
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
have people that are saying, trust me,
believe in me, have faith in me. And I

75
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
think that is not the ideal environment to
create the systems that we want to build,

76
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
right?

77
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's a part of why, at least with Ergo,
I've always tried to push for building

78
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
public. We should ideally have these
primitives in place that are the

79
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
equivalent of public goods. They're open,
they're auditable, and hopefully through

80
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
time and with testing, they also become
extended, right? They become extendable.

81
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You could look at something within the
Ergo network like SigmaUSD, right? You

82
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
have first it's based on research, right?
It's not something that is just

83
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
willy-nilly thrown together, which we do
see a lot of that in the space, right? So

84
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
as an experiment, it has a solid
foundation, right? Then you have kind of

85
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
open code, open parameters around that
experiment.

86
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That even if the experiment itself
experiences difficulty, you have the

87
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
ability to extend it, adjust it. It's
open, right? It's open to new ideas. It's

88
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
open to new iteration. And ultimately,
through time, I think we can build solid

89
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
public goods with that framework.

90
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And my hope would be that creates its own
flywheel effect. Everybody in crypto these

91
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
days will talk about the flywheel in terms
of financial games. The ideal, in my

92
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
opinion, is to create flywheels with
software to where you have these public

93
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
goods that can then be reused, right? And
the more diverse these building blocks

94
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
come, you can suddenly cater to a larger
class of functions and applications and

95
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
build something that has a solid
foundation.

96
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Sometimes we get away from this idea of
open code. And I think that type of

97
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
transparency should be a solid base for a
healthy social system because it's based

98
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
in trust, right? Not faith.

99
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You know, we are a proof of work network.
And proof of work, one of the interesting

100
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
things is a coordination mechanism is it's
leaderless. It's apolitical, right? And

101
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that's something that people often
struggle with, like grasping in terms of

102
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
the social system. You know, they'll say,
hey, Armeanio, you need to go dance over

103
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
here. Go do over there. You're supposed to
be a leader.

104
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And it's like, well, I have a certain set
of skills, right? But meeting everybody

105
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
that attended, and I'm sure everybody
watching, you have a different set of

106
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
skills. No different than in the off-chain
peer-to-peer economy, you bring different

107
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
skill sets, different abilities, different
specialties that you've developed through

108
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
time in your life, and you create value
using those.

109
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't think there should be that much
difference. I'm not universally

110
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
intelligent enough to be the leader of
everything, right? I have my areas where I

111
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
would say I've learned and grown and
developed a certain skill set, but in

112
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
other areas, you do not want me in charge,
right? I'm not the guy.

113
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And people struggle with that. Because in
social systems, a lot of the competition

114
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
is to be the guy, right? You know,
certainly if I have people's trust and

115
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
belief in faith and they follow me, you
know, I guess that's an attack vector that

116
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
we see all the time in crypto.

117
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And it's funny how, you know, the sheep
are taught their entire life to fear the

118
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
wolf. And then in the end, the shepherd
eats them. Right? You know, so having that

119
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
basis of how do we create trustlessness,
not just in software, but also in the

120
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
social system itself, that takes
responsibility. It takes a collective

121
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
responsibility, right? We're going to
build things the right way.

122
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And at least in Extended UTXO, there is a
trilemma, let's call it. You have the

123
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
contract itself. You have the off-chain
logic. You have the front end, right? In

124
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
the ideal scenario, all three of those can
be replicated locally. That's what I would

125
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
say makes for a decentralized application.
That's pretty clear parameters, right?

126
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So as an ecosystem, I think it's healthy
to really push for that. That's something

127
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
that I've always tried to promote. And
it's hard to build open code, right?

128
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Because you are in essence being naked in
public. It is sometimes a process to get

129
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
there, right? But I think that is
ultimately, a solid goal in terms of

130
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
building public goods.

131
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You know, so we hear about this trilemma
in blockchain all the time. You know, you

132
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
usually have, it's a selling point. For
lack of a better term, it's a selling

133
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
point. But I do think that within the Ergo
ecosystem anyway, I would like to promote

134
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
the idea of our own little trilemma, which
are those three aspects of an application.

135
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And ideally, if you have those three
aspects that are open, and you have

136
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
tooling that becomes kind of a common
knowledge base for developers to use and

137
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
build off of. You have things in place to
start creating the right flywheel. That's

138
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
kind of hard to bootstrap from nothing,
but I think we've done a pretty good job

139
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
as a whole of creating that mindset and
mind-share.

140
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
There have been a lot of developers, some
of which are here, some of which choose to

141
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
remain faceless, which I totally respect,
that have contributed to that type of

142
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
mindset. And so, you know, everybody
that's contributed to that ideal public

143
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
goods, I kind of have to tip my hat to
you, that's ultimately powerful when it

144
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
comes to not just the network itself, but
also the social system of the network.

145
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Now, from first principles, crypto should
be about the distribution of power. Proof

146
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
of work kind of represents that in terms
of the distribution mechanism of money

147
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
itself. It's something that you can
certainly compete for and build into, but

148
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
having clear assumptions in terms of
distribution of power is needed.

149
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And sometimes that is buried behind
really good marketing. Sometimes that's

150
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
buried behind social systems. Sometimes
it's buried behind this trust me bro

151
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
mentality that permeates the crypto
industry and I think that's toxic and I

152
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
don't really care if people don't like
that. Right because if you can't call a

153
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
spade a spade your social system is not
going to work right. That's just honest.

154
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I know there's a lot of financial games
and cultural movements and things like

155
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
that. I've said from day one, for me
personally, I would rather go to a casino.

156
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I know the drinks are free. That's a solid
assumption that I can bank on every time.

157
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And whatever my parameters of risk are
with the games that I play, at least I

158
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
know that assumption is going to hold.

159
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Now, security is another powerful
mechanism of both the network parameters

160
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and kind of this social layer, because we
do need to address both, right? Sometimes

161
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
we see them as separate and they're
extensions of each other, you know, in

162
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
terms of what people accept.

163
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Security, at least in our industry, is
something that's formed through time. You

164
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
usually have research as the bedrock of
computer science. Then on top of research,

165
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
you have implementations where people will
try to take research use engineering

166
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
skills to convert that into something
that's tangible. And then you have the

167
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
test of time, which kind of is the
ultimate teacher in life.

168
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So having things that are built on a
solid foundation and are introduced and

169
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
kind of go through this test of hardening
through time ultimately should be a goal.

170
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That doesn't mean you can't innovate,
right? It doesn't mean you can't extend.

171
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It doesn't mean you can't provide
research.

172
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Certainly in Ergo, we have led in various
areas of implementing things that kind of

173
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
came from the academic sphere. But I think
there's an element of wisdom in being

174
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
conservative, right? And sometimes that is
not the focus of the crypto space, right?

175
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Innovation is wonderful, but I would also
say that sometimes iteration is

176
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
innovation, right? Where you take
something, you extend it. It holds you

177
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
extended, it holds you extended rather
than, you know, trying to reinvent the

178
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
wheel for the 700th time and, you know,
it's good for marketing. It's not

179
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
necessarily good for security, right?

180
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Because you have a weird curve
distribution where through time, you know,

181
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
usually you have the research side, right?
And like the engineering complexity let's

182
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
say, is much higher. And then through
time, as it becomes more of a standard, it

183
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
becomes easier to adopt. There's better
tools.

184
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Like that whole process of evolution is
not something that you can cheat very

185
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
effectively. It's something that is much
slower than the hype cycles that people

186
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
are taught, right?

187
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So I want everyone to remember when it
comes to security that time is ultimately

188
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
the test. We can look at the first
principle of privacy, which is probably

189
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
fundamentally one of the most important
things we need to explore.

190
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
There is some potential future where the
children people in this room have could

191
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
grow up into a world where every economic
transaction they touch is audited, stored,

192
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
and you know, you could watch every penny
that someone has touched throughout the

193
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
course of their life. That type of control
system is getting to the point where it's

194
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
technically possible, and that should
frighten the hell out of everybody, right?

195
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That type of system, I do believe there
are some powers in this world. That's

196
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
where they would like to take humanity,
right? Because it certainly offers them

197
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
greater power and control.

198
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And so I think having the ability to
remain private, anonymous, have your

199
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
personal space is going to be one of the
most fundamentally important things that

200
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
we need to work to protect as an industry.
And that doesn't just mean we're going to

201
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
add zero-knowledge proofs to everything
and have more control systems in place.

202
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I think that's a bit of a perversion from
privacy itself, right? That's a trade-off

203
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
that many people see is quite sexy, right?
Where, you know, we're going to have ZK

204
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
compliance and, you know, if you just get
more and more and more and more ZK

205
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
compliance, you have a stronger control
system.

206
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So I think we need to really look at this
idea of privacy, make that an absolute,

207
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
chase that on multiple layers of networks
rather than have it be toy. Because, you

208
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
know, I would say in some cases, yes, it
does offer like visibility assistance in

209
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
terms of people not seeing your
transactions or what's happening, but in

210
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
terms of the broader assumption, it's toy
privacy, it's not real.

211
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And I think we need to be very clear in
terms of what our set of assumptions are

212
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
long term with privacy and what the goals
are with privacy. Because there are a lot

213
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
of projects, there's a lot of research
beyond Ergo itself that is valuable in

214
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
terms of preserving privacy, preserving
anonymity.

215
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I think that ultimately should be one of
the most important tenets of creating

216
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
censorship-resistant systems and
censorship-resistant money.

217
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You know, the other area has to do with
inclusion, right? We are seeing a mix in

218
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
the space where it comes to regulated
assets, non-regulated assets, bearer

219
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
assets, non-bearer assets. And that needs
to be something that there's a lot of

220
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
clarity with, because not everything in
crypto is the same.

221
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I know that in the social layer,
everything is a ticker with some letters

222
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
in it, right? But the underlying
assumptions that you need to make in terms

223
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
of custodial, non-custodial, is this a
bearer asset, is this not a bearer asset,

224
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
is probably going to get even more complex
when we start seeing regulated assets

225
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
appearing.

226
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
We've kind of seen some of this freeze
and seize with stable coins, but the

227
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
crypto industry is changing. Even
yesterday or two days ago, there's an

228
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
announcement that these 10 major banks are
going to collaborate and create some

229
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
stablecoin instruments. Oddly enough, they
tend to be the same banks that are in the

230
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
corporation that's on the hill, but that's
the side journey that probably not the

231
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
rabbit hole for right now.

232
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,000
But that type of assumption of inclusion
is going to get really important. I do

233
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
know that kushti has been working on a
whitelist mechanism, which I think is

234
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,000
probably the better way to deal with
uncertainty in terms of power.

235
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Where, you know, rather than you join and
you might get blacklisted at any time for

236
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
any reason, you make a voluntary
agreement. And hopefully there's clear

237
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
assumptions in that agreement in terms of
the risks that you're inheriting in doing

238
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
that, right?

239
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Last is probably this element of
resilience, right? And ultimately, I think

240
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
that's why open source code is so
important because good ideas are hard to

241
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
kill, right? I do hope not just within
Ergo, but within various aspects of the

242
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
cryptocurrency space and some of the
privacy space that's been around, we're

243
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
able to develop tools that ultimately
develop into truly resilient systems.

244
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I've operated under the belief that over
the long arc of time, the only thing of

245
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
value in cryptocurrency really is state
resistance. Everything else will probably,

246
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
in my opinion, distill down to the common
denominator underneath, which is

247
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
centralization.

248
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Because if you're not shooting for state
resistance, ultimately the most efficient

249
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
thing is going to prevail through time,
and the most efficient thing will be

250
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
centralized. No, maybe it'll be pseudo
centralized. We can have a debate whether

251
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Amazon Web Services is distributed,
decentralized, because you have data

252
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
centers all over the place that optimize
speed.

253
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But I would say that in terms of power
distribution, we have to be honest and

254
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
say, OK, it is distributed, but the actual
concentration of power there is pretty

255
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
apparent.

256
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So over time, if we build on first
principles, I do believe that the crypto

257
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,000
space is capable of developing open source
tools for coordinating capital and

258
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,000
creating systems where within a certain
set of assumptions, we can assume honesty.

259
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And luckily, at least with Ergo, we have
this proof of work mechanism that has a

260
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
pretty well time tested mechanism of what
are your assumptions of honesty? What are

261
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
your attack vectors?

262
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:52,000
In terms of the contractual layer that
we've come up with, it is relatively

263
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:01,000
conservative. So I think those are solid
building blocks towards a larger goal.

264
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Sometimes within the social layer of
crypto, you sign on to TwitterX, whatever

265
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
you want to call it, and you listen to
the, I don't know, commentary, the talking

266
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
heads. It does kind of leave you
wondering, what the hell are we doing?

267
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Right?

268
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Why are we here? And I think that
ultimately should be the most important

269
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
aspect is we need to have clear intent and
clear purpose. Because if you don't have

270
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
clear intents and clear purpose, you're
not going to be grounded in what you do,

271
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
right? And crypto as a whole, I would say,
needs to be more grounded, right?

272
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I do hope that over time, we create a
tool set that's diverse enough, you know,

273
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
and again, an extended UTXO that's going
to be contractual, it's going to be off

274
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
chain, it's going to be front end wise. We
create enough tools around those three

275
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
problem areas, the trilemma, let's say,
that we can serve a diverse set of needs.

276
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And I think sometimes marketing and kind
of just social spam buries that intent,

277
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,000
right? So my hope in going through all of
the presentations that we've set up all of

278
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
the speakers, everybody here is doing
really unique things that are targeted

279
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
that improve like the assumptions that
offer new tools and understanding that as

280
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,000
a piece that can be replicated within a
whole, over time I believe will lead to a

281
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
broader tool set that's powerful.

282
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And I think we've done a pretty good job
as an ecosystem developing open public

283
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:18,000
goods, sets of tools that have led to some
interesting things. We just went through a

284
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:26,000
major upgrade with Sigma 6, new node
version, right? And that will open the

285
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:34,000
door to a lot of new capacity.

286
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And I hope that as we kind of build to
enhance new system capacities, we stay

287
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
focused in on mission. Because that type
of purpose I think is important. It's not

288
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
just important for like solid programming,
beyond the network, it's important for the

289
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
social system.

290
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And the social system in crypto is very
toxic. It's just honest. You know, I

291
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
sometimes have said, you know, my favorite
thing is seeing all of these tools that

292
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
enhance individual power, takes
responsibility. My least favorite thing in

293
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
crypto is people that look for a savior,
right?

294
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Because that's not really how
peer-to-peer networks work. That's the

295
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
client-server relationship, my friends. So
if we get back to this idea of saying,

296
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
okay, how can we distribute power across
peers and empower peers to have tooling,

297
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
to have access, to have software that
ultimately can serve them and their needs,

298
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
that's the ideal for cryptocurrency.

299
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I would say everything else is just
digital money. And I think we need to kind

300
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
of lean into that because, you know, the
possibilities if, you know, privacy does

301
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
not work as an industry, if resilience
doesn't work as an industry, the

302
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
trade-offs are huge in terms of the world
long-term, you know, that could be spun up

303
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
around us.

304
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And, you know, sometimes I wonder what
kind of world my children will live in,

305
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
right? Like, I can see myself, I was born
into this strange system, you know, you

306
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
got the people on the hill, you've got,
you know, this distribution of power that

307
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I can't really touch or interact with
much.

308
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
But what about the future? How much
stronger could that get theoretically? And

309
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
that should scare the shit out of
everybody, in all honesty. So for me, I

310
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
think that kind of sums up the purpose,
the intent of why I'm here, right? It's

311
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
the only thing that matters.

312
00:32:04,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So I do hope that as an industry, it's
something that, you know, we can mature

313
00:33:45,000 --> 00:35:26,000
around, look at all of the trade-offs of
control in different areas and build

314
00:35:26,000 --> 00:37:07,000
wisely. So I'm going to kick it off to
MGPai and Luca. I need to set up their

315
00:37:07,000 --> 00:38:48,000
mics, set up their presentation, get them
ready to go. But thank you everybody for

316
00:38:48,000 --> 00:40:29,000
tuning in and enjoy.

317
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Hey, guys. So that was a great speech
from Joe. And thank you to Joe and the

318
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Sigmanauts for sponsoring and hosting this
event. It's wonderful to finally see some

319
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:54,000
faces. So today, we're going to be talking
about Palm staking on the UTXO model.

320
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So over the last year or so, I worked on
implementing a native token staking

321
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:10,000
platform on Cardano. And as you know,
Cardano and Ergo are very similar in terms

322
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:18,000
of how their contracts work. And they all
share the UTXO model. So I'll try to keep

323
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:26,000
this as easy to understand as possible so
everyone can understand.

324
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
So we have some existing implementations
of staking already. So if you guys don't

325
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
know, over the last cycle DeFi summer, we
had sushi swap and pancake swap. And for

326
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
really anyone new here, pancake swap was
like how Solana is today. They had all the

327
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,000
memes and they were going crazy with all
the meme coins, all the launches, and

328
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
staking with those meme coins.

329
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And before PancakeSwap, we had SushiSwap,
which really was a Uniswap clone, but they

330
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
actually did some research and they were
the first ones to implement this native,

331
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
the modern native token staking or ERC20
staking. So sushi swap had this staking

332
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
which really is to incentivize people
right because staking makes people hold

333
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
their tokens right so it kind of
stabilizes price movements and yeah sushi

334
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
swap pioneered this and then we got
pancake swap which basically copied it and

335
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,000
made some improvements and really brought
it to the mass users, right?

336
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Tons of people were just making meme
coins and having staking with it. So, you

337
00:42:51,000 --> 00:43:01,000
know, you don't sell those meme coins and,
you know, kind of like inflation and Ponzi

338
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:11,000
scheme and so on.

339
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:19,000
So let's have a refresher. So what is the
account model and what is the UTXO model,

340
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:27,000
right? So the account model is... Let's
start with UTXO. So what are UTXOs? UTXOs

341
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:35,000
were pioneered by Bitcoin, right? That's
how they started their entire system.

342
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,000
So UTXOs stand for unspent transaction
outputs. And it's basically the outputs of

343
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,000
the previous transaction you did. So when
you submit a transaction, you have a bunch

344
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
of metadata, right? You have what went
into the transaction and what came out of

345
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:59,000
the transaction. And the outputs of this
transaction are referred to as UTXOs.

346
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And the transaction model really is an
exact digital analogy to cash. So let's

347
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
say I have a $10 bill, and I want to pay
for $6 coffee. It's probably $8 now, no

348
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
inflation. And if I want to pay for $6 of
coffee with my $10 bill, I can't just rip

349
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
the bill in half, right?

350
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I have to spend the entire $10 bill. So
what do I do? I give the cashier my entire

351
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
bill and that's it. They have the bill.
They're not going to rip it in half or

352
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
anything. It's just gone. But they're
going to give me back $4. And this $4 is

353
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
completely new. It's not the original
bill, it's just completely new. The $10 I

354
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
had, it's gone.

355
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So this is how you can think of the UTXO
model. When you have an input, it always

356
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
must be spent. It's always unique. You
cannot spend an input more than once.

357
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Unlike cache, I guess the cashier could
spend it in other places. But in the UTXO

358
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
model, it can be only spent once.

359
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And another analogy that I like is with
the old-fashioned piggy banks, right? So

360
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
you would have savings in a piggy bank,
and if you ever wanted to spend it, you

361
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
would have to smash it open, right? It's
like a one-time thing. So you can also

362
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
think of that, right? I have $10 in my
piggy bank. The piggy bank is the UTXO,

363
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
and that's like the input, right?

364
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And then if I want to actually spend it,
I would smash the piggy bank open, and

365
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,000
it's gone, right? Just one time. So that's
really a brief overview of the UTXO model

366
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,000
and Cardano and Ergo both make use of
this.

367
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
So what's the account model? Account
model is really the newer model and it was

368
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
pioneered by Ethereum. And account model
really is analogous to your bank account

369
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
where you just have a list of transactions
saying that maybe $10 was deposited and

370
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
you're spending $1 and you have a list of
transaction history, right?

371
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
So addresses are seen as accounts and you
just have a direct tally of balance. And

372
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
the thing with this, and I think of it as
a problem, is that you need global state,

373
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
right? So you need to know the history of
everything from the start, right? When the

374
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
account got funded to how much you have
now, to know how much you have at this

375
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
moment, right?

376
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
You have to do some calculations, right?
Some balance add, balance deductions and

377
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
so on. So but this is overall how the
account model works and it is also quite

378
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
popular, right? All the Ethereum forks use
that and Solana uses that and all the

379
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
newer model and newer blockchains also use
that.

380
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:11,000
For those of you following Cardano, they
have a new blockchain called Midnight that

381
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:18,000
they're probably going to launch next
quarter or so. And Midnight uses a hybrid

382
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:25,000
of account model and UTXO, so it's quite
popular.

383
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
So let's talk about the advantage of
account model in the context of this

384
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
staking. Staking is more analogous to a
client-server interaction. What that means

385
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
is that a server is really just a computer
that never turns off. It's always running

386
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
in the background. Client is really the
people who hit that server. You need to

387
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
talk to that server to do something.

388
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
For example, if you're logging into your
email account, you're accessing a server

389
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,000
which holds all your emails and all. And
you're the client, you're trying to log in

390
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
from your laptop. So that's a
client-server interaction.

391
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So staking is similar to this
interaction, where the stakers are the

392
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
clients. And they deposit their tokens to
a contract. And this contract, you can

393
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
think of it as like a server in the sense
that the contract has to manage all the

394
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
global state, right? It has to track the
balance so it knows how much rewards that

395
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
you get, right?

396
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Because rewards are a function of how
much tokens you deposit and how long you

397
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:45,000
have deposited them for. So Solidity is
the smart contract, a very popular smart

398
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
contract language that runs on this
account model. So Solidity is perfect,

399
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,000
right? It has a single authoritative
contract storage, right?

400
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
So you have something called a map, and a
map is a very basic data structure that

401
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
you have a key. So a key is like the user,
like your user, your wallet address. And

402
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000
if you access the data within that wallet
address, you have a bunch of data like how

403
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
much they have deposited in the contract
and how long they had the tokens on and

404
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
all sorts of useful information. Perfect
for this.

405
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
And then this doesn't translate well to
something in the UTXO model. So for UTXO

406
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
contracts, you have a single UTXO, right?
And each UTXO, you can think of it as its

407
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,000
own entity. So an UTXO has its, each UTXO
can have its own contract. So a contract's

408
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:49,000
state release with respect to the UTXO
it's inside of.

409
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
So a UTXO has this bottleneck, right? You
can't just store infinite data in it,

410
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
right? The UTXO, you have a size limit.
And you also have a broader transaction

411
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
size limit because you can argue that,
hey, why don't you have a bunch of UTXOs,

412
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
this single UTXOs, interact with?

413
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
So you can have a bunch of data. So if a
UTXO data size limit is 4 kilobytes, you

414
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
can be like, OK, why don't we just do
1,000 UTXOs? Why not? Why not make it like

415
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,000
four gigabytes or something, right? No,
that's not possible because you have your

416
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
bottleneck by transaction size limits.

417
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
You can only deal with a specific amount
of UTXOs per transaction. And then on top

418
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
of that, you also got the block size
limit, right? So you can only have a

419
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
certain amount of transactions per block.
So a lot of bottlenecks here. So how can

420
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
we move on with this?

421
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
It almost seems impossible to bring
something that needs such a large global

422
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,000
seed. Because remember, this might
translate to like 10 users, 100 users. But

423
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,000
how are we going to scale to like 10,000
users? Because each user are going to have

424
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,000
some size of data that's not going to
scale. So how do we do this?

425
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
So I had to rethink staking on the UTXO
model. So data stored for the global

426
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
variables, so for all sorts of staking
calculations, they need to be bound to a

427
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
constant size limit. You can't have it
scale with the amount of users, right? So

428
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
you can't be like, OK, one user is like
one gigabyte of data, right? 10,000 users

429
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
is 10,000 gigabytes.

430
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
We can't scale like that. It has to be
one user is like one gigabyte of data. A

431
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
million users is still one gigabyte of
data, right? How can we make that happen?

432
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
It has to be constant.

433
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So a clear solution which several
projects on Cardano and Ergo follow, so I

434
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,000
think the people behind Crux Finance, I'm
forgetting their name, I think they're

435
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
shut down now but you know they pioneered
a staking model and then a bunch of

436
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Cardano projects have their own staking.

437
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
So what do they do? So they have some
sort of position or UTXO or NFT that you

438
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
can think of which indicates a share of
how much they have staked, right? So let's

439
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
say you stake a certain amount of tokens,
you'll get back like a unique token saying

440
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
that, hey, this person staked like 100
tokens on the platform at this time,

441
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
right?

442
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So if you ever want to claim that stake
back, make an update, you have to deposit

443
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
that unique token you got back into the
contract, right? And this is a pretty

444
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
straightforward and well-known solution to
this problem. However, this was not ideal

445
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
for ZenGate's purpose because of legal
conflicts.

446
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
The problem is that you can have
derivative markets of something like a

447
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
position token because I can take my
position token and I can be like okay I

448
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
don't want to be in this anymore but I
don't want to lose like that accumulation

449
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
of rewards right like maybe like the
longer you stake the faster you earn

450
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
rewards or something right it keeps
compounding so maybe I sell it to someone

451
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
else or just give it to someone else right
or what if...

452
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
So you create these derivative markets,
and it's a conflict from a legal

453
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
standpoint. I don't know why, but it is
what it is. It's a very gray area in

454
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
general, unfortunately.

455
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,000
So I thought of this data structure
called a Merkle tree. And this was

456
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
absolutely perfect. So on Ergo, you have
the AVL tree. And it's quite similar, so

457
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,000
it can just translate to Ergo.

458
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Also, what's actually really interesting
is that the Merkle Tree data structure is

459
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
something that was just implemented at a
contract level on Cardano. However, on

460
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Ergo, ErgoScript, you have AVL tree as
like a native data structure within the

461
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
language.

462
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
So what that means is that basically you
can trust the data structure on Ergo more

463
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,000
because like the core team, so basically
kushti made the implementation like in the

464
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
compiler itself, right? So it's not like a
third party code that you're trusting to

465
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
be correct, which is like, which is the
case on Cardano.

466
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:55,000
So let's see what is a Merkle tree,
because I honestly barely knew about it

467
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:04,000
until I did this.

468
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
So a Merkle tree is a tree-based data
structure. And a tree-based data

469
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
structure, you can really think of it
having a root at the top. And it has

470
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
branches pointing to more roots, right? So
you can kind of see that data structure in

471
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
the diagram behind me.

472
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
And the boxes, they're called nodes. So
you have one root node. It's the main node

473
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
on top. Then you have those lines are
called branches. And then you have another

474
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
node that's called branches. They're like
intermediary nodes. And all the way at the

475
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
bottom, you can see a bunch of nodes, like
the final nodes. Those are called the

476
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
leaves.

477
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,000
That's just a very well-known data
structure in computer science. So a Merkle

478
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
tree is a variant of this data structure.
And it's made by hashing hashes of data.

479
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,000
So I know that's confusing. So let's break
that down.

480
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,000
So behind me, you can see that you have a
block of data, like a block of files. So

481
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
A.txt, B.txt, C.txt, D.txt. And you hash
this block of data. And hashing really

482
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:19,000
means is that you take data of any size
and you convert it into a fixed-sized

483
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:25,000
string of a certain data size.

484
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So in this, or in most cases, it's always
32 bytes of data. So it's like a string of

485
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
64 characters. And the cool part about
this, which is really important in a

486
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
security context, is that it's
irreversible. So if you have this

487
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
fixed-size string, you can't get the data
back. It's impossible.

488
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,000
But that's beyond the scope of this
presentation. So again, you have a data,

489
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,000
and you transform it into a fixed-size,
unique string. So you can see A.text has a

490
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,000
hash H1Z2, B.text has its own hash, and so
on.

491
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
So how does this translate to a Merkle
tree? So look at the tree behind me. All

492
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
the way at the bottom, the leaf nodes, you
can see that we brought those hashes over,

493
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
right? The H1Z2Y77A and so on, right? So
those are the hashes brought to the node,

494
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,000
and they're at the bottom.

495
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,000
So now you look at the left side, the
bottom left side of the tree. So we take

496
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,000
the H1Z2Y7FA. We can't read it from here.
And so those are the hashes for A.text,

497
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:42,000
B.text, right? So we take those hashes and
we concatenate them. We put them together.

498
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,000
And we take the hash of that.

499
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:55,000
So the hash of that, you can see, is
right above those two. So it's U67R on the

500
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:02,000
left side. And again, we do this exact
thing on the right side. So for C.txt and

501
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:09,000
D.txt, and we get a hash. Now those hashes
in the middle, again, we take them, we

502
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
concatenate them, and we get the hash. And
that final hash is called the root hash.

503
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,000
So why this is really cool is because you
can find differences between two states,

504
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
so meaning like two different trees. So if
you made any modifications, you can find

505
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
the difference between them like really
fast because think of it logically right

506
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
if you have two pieces of data what do you
have to do you have to iterate through

507
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,000
them right like one like bit at a time
like the smallest like unit of difference

508
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
right you have to iterate through them so
you know if there's like a million pieces

509
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,000
of like units of data you have to make at
least like at most a million iterations

510
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:57,000
right it doesn't scale so with this it's a
lot faster right it's like the log of a

511
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,000
million maybe that's like like a thousand
or ten thousand.

512
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I don't know, but it's a lot
significantly faster, right? So let me

513
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
explain this further. So you can see that
we had the text files, right? And we

514
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
changed the contents of C.text. And what
does that do? We got a new hash. So you

515
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
can see A4W12, right?

516
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
So on the right side of the Merkle tree,
you can see that all the way at the

517
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
bottom, that changed, right? It's in
yellow. And now, since that changed, the

518
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
hash above it, which is, remember, made by
concatenating the hash of C.text and

519
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
D.text, that also changed, right? And
since that changed, the root hash also

520
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
changed.

521
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
So you can see here that when you
traverse the tree, you first check the

522
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
left side. And you're like, oh, the left
side's exactly the same. So you know that

523
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
A.text and B.text is clearly unchanged.
But then you go to the right side, and you

524
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
can see that, OK, D.txt isn't changed,
right? Although at the bottom right, it's

525
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
still the same.

526
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:12,000
So then you know really quickly that
C.txt is changed. So it's a really clever

527
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,000
data structure. It actually powers so much
of the modern infrastructure. You just

528
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:24,000
don't know it. But that's a quick
introduction to a Merkle tree.

529
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So yeah, you can see here the comparisons
made, right? So on the left side was the

530
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:39,000
original tree, and the right side is the
tree with the C.text changed. So you can

531
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:46,000
see we just make three comparisons. So
this scales really well.

532
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So now what we actually use for the
staking is something called the Merkle

533
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Patricia trie. And what this is is
basically an optimized version of the

534
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Merkle Tree. So a trie really is a, you
can think of it as a key value map indexed

535
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:10,000
by the key's nibble. So it's just like a
bunch of characters, like ASCII

536
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:16,000
characters. And that's what a trie is.

537
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
And Patricia is just an optimization of
the path, right? So it's a very optimized

538
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,000
structure. So you make even less. So in
the previous slide, we made like three

539
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,000
traversals, right? So this makes it even
smaller, like maybe like one or two. And

540
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,000
then Merkle is from what we discussed
before.

541
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,000
And then the proof is the path of nodes
that you traversed, right? So in the

542
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
previous slide, we traversed through like
three nodes. So that's like the proof, you

543
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
can think of it as that. And then proving,
right? What is the action of proving?

544
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:01,000
So you have the inputs of the known root
hash, right? So the hash all the way at

545
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:07,000
the top, you have that. And then you
provide the proof. So you provide that

546
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:13,000
path. And then you provide the key and the
claimed value. So you walk through from

547
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:19,000
the root node to until you get to the key.
You walk through the tree.

548
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
And then once you reach to the value, you
stop. And then you compute the root hashes

549
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
from that traversal. You can do that same
hashing from the scratch. And then you

550
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
compare it. Hey, is the thing I computed,
does it match what I already know? And if

551
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,000
yes, then you know that everything's
correct, like no one's messing with

552
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
anything, right?

553
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And yeah, so membership is proven when
the computed root equals the known root.

554
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:55,000
And the known root is what you passed in.

555
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:02,000
So let's talk about how this integrates
into staking. So client balances are

556
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:08,000
stored in this trie-based data structure
and on-chain, so in the contracts itself,

557
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,000
only the root hash is stored. And
remember, the root hash is a fixed size

558
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,000
string of 32 bytes, right? Because it's a
hash.

559
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
And that answers the problem in the, you
know, we saw a couple slides back where we

560
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
want one user to be, say, one gigabyte of
data, and we want a million users to still

561
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:36,000
be that one gigabyte of data. So it's
constant. So in this case, it's always a

562
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
constant 32 bytes, which is incredibly
tiny.

563
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
So it's always this number, even if we
have a million clients, which is really

564
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
cool. And thanks to that Merkle tree
diagram I explained, it's hashes of hashes

565
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
of hashes and so on. So any time any
insertions or updates done, the contract

566
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
does verification.

567
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,000
So as I explained in the previous slide,
you have a proof and you have the known

568
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
root hash. So you provide the proof and
the known root hash. And what does the

569
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,000
contract do? The contract only does
computing, right? It only does

570
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,000
verification. It doesn't need to do all
the data storage or anything, right?

571
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
You provide the exact data that it needs.
The least amount of data it needs to

572
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
actually prove what you're doing is
correct and you're not providing false

573
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,000
information. So, and remember, after all
of this is done, so if there's any like

574
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,000
mutations sent to the state, so meaning
like if you added more stake or you did a

575
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,000
claim or you did a withdrawal, that's a
mutation, right?

576
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
The only thing that changes is the root
hash, right? So it's always that constant

577
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
size length.

578
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:00,000
When these updates and claims happen,
you're providing the proof. The downside

579
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,000
of this is that you have to store this
data somewhere. It's not magic. So you

580
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
have to store the data in your own server,
right? It's called the off-chain. So you

581
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:18,000
have to store the data.

582
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:28,000
You're responsible for storing the data
in Solidity. You can just throw it on the

583
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:38,000
blockchain and just make sure, like the
EVM nodes, right? The Ethereum nodes, the

584
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:48,000
heavy 2, 3 terabytes, 6 terabytes nodes,
right? That stores all of that, right? So

585
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:58,000
you just worry about that. But on the Ergo
sense, you are storing the data.

586
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Great. No, that's an excellent question.
So we got Grayman asking, what if the

587
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,000
staking platform goes down? Or what if I
just disappears, everyone's screwed? What

588
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,000
if I just take down all my servers? Well,
that's actually not going to be an issue.

589
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Because like I said, you're not trusting
me with the data.

590
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I can't just magically change the data.
Because all the mutations, they're done by

591
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
putting them through the contract right so
if you have like some initial state you

592
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,000
have to put it through the contract to get
the next state right so the contracts

593
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
always the intermediary between state
changes so the contract does all the

594
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
checks it needs to do.

595
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Regarding the data, it's really cool
because you can actually walk through the

596
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
blockchain, walk through all the blocks
and you can always recalculate it. It's

597
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
not magic. The blockchain doesn't store
the data but it has like... You can think

598
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
of it as snapshots in time, right?

599
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:22,000
So you can traverse through all the
original snapshots and get back the

600
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:37,000
current data, the most recent current
state. So no, you're not trusting me, and

601
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:52,000
you have as much security as the contract
provides. Is that clear?

602
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Right, and so the question is, how can
you recover if the data is just all

603
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,000
hashes? Then what you can recover, because
hashes are non-reversible. No, that's a

604
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,000
great question. So off-chain obviously
doesn't store the hashes. So whenever you

605
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,000
actually interact with the transaction,
you're providing the actual data, not the

606
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
hash, the actual data.

607
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Into the transaction when you build it
and you submit the transaction. And the

608
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
contract is actually what hashes the data.
So you provide the complete open data.

609
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
You're not hiding the data. And then the
contract does the hashing and the

610
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
checking.

611
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
So like I said, it does computation,
right? The contract only does computation.

612
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
So you provide the raw data, and the
contract just does hashing of the data.

613
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
And this is possible because of, yeah, so
I have it in this slide here, that

614
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,000
whenever you do any staking, you provide
the actual raw data.

615
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:05,000
And it's done through something called
the Redeemer on Cardano. Or on Ergo, it's

616
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:11,000
called a context-aware. And it's the same
thing. It's just data that anyone can

617
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,000
provide into a transaction when you build
it and submit it. There's some limit of

618
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:23,000
data that you can provide into this.

619
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:28,000
We provide the actual data within this
constraint. When you do this, that data is

620
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,000
actually published on the blockchain. But
this is a really special type of data

621
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,000
where it's not actually in the context of
the node, right? So the node doesn't know

622
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,000
about the redeemer.

623
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
It doesn't save it for long term, but it
does save it from historical transactions,

624
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
right? Just in the same way that you know
the transactions an address did, right?

625
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
The address had an initial balance of one
ERG, and then, you know, a year later, it

626
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
has like a hundred. You can track that,
right?

627
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:15,000
So in the same sense, you can track this
data in the Redeemer context variable. So

628
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:25,000
really, to summarize, you can get back the
data by traversing historical

629
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:35,000
transactions. So you're not trusting me at
all.

630
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
All right, great. So yeah, no, just to
summarize, really, the contract is

631
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
something that just verifies the integrity
of the provided data. And that's really

632
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
the general theme of contracts on the UTXO
model contracts. Position really just to

633
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
verify all the data, right?

634
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
It doesn't make new data. It doesn't do
anything special. It just verifies, hey,

635
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
is what the transaction builder provided,
is that correct? Are they like lying about

636
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,000
something, right? Because checking
something is always far cheaper than

637
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
actually making it from scratch, right?

638
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
And I think that's really where UTXO
shines because account model has to store

639
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
all this data. I mean, sure, it's easier
for developers, but these node sizes are

640
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
ridiculous. I can't run a three terabyte
node in my basement just for Ethereum. And

641
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
that's just Ethereum.

642
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
You have all these forks, right? If I
want to expand to multi-chain, I have to

643
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
spin up like an Ethereum node, a Binance
node, Polygon node, and so on, right? If I

644
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,000
want to do the things the right way and
not, you know, buy like a subscription to

645
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
an RPC, right?

646
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,000
And it's not scalable, but in my
basement, I can run an Ergo node, which

647
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,000
has what, like 20 gigs, 30 gigs? It's
nothing, right? Flash Drive has more

648
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,000
storage than that. And Cardano node,
right? Cardano node was like 160

649
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:04,000
gigabytes. I can run plenty of these
compared to just one Ethereum node.

650
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:13,000
So you can see the trade-offs here. They
really shine in the long run.

651
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:18,000
So really the final slide here is
improvements made to the original

652
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,000
protocol, right? So the original contract
was short-lived and static. So like I

653
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,000
said, it was originally meant for like
things like meme coins, right? So where

654
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
you just don't want people to sell, right?
You don't really think about long-term.

655
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:42,000
And the problem with this was it was very
static. So you have one emission rate for

656
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:49,000
the whole program. So what I also added to
the protocol itself, not the UTXO

657
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:56,000
implementation, is I made the emissions
very dynamic.

658
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
So like every epoch, for example, on Palm
staking every week, people can claim their

659
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,000
rewards. This emission amount can
fluctuate without having to redeploy the

660
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,000
contract or get people to migrate. And
this is really cool because a dynamic

661
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:16,000
protocol allows us to easily curb any
excess inflation or incentivizes staking

662
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,000
during steep price movements.

663
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
So it allows us for more of a
fine-grained control rather than... So,

664
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
you know, we actually react to how the
economy is doing. I mean, you saw

665
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
yesterday that, you know, things went
crazy. So maybe during a time like that,

666
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
you want to incentivize people to hold,
right?

667
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
So maybe we'll tell them, okay, we can
increase inflation so that, you know,

668
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
people hold on to their palms instead of
selling it on the market just for no

669
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
reason right when everything's going crazy
right so then people might not sell

670
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
because they'll say hey like I can just
put in the contract I believe in Palm I

671
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
believe in this tokens future right I
believe in crypto so like maybe in a next

672
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
week you're not going to the tariffs are
going to be reversed and we won't have an

673
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
issue.

674
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:16,000
So maybe I want to hold my Palm and make
some more Palm and money instead of

675
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:22,000
selling, right? So the dynamic protocol
really allows for this. Yeah, that's it

676
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,000
for staking. So hopefully that was some
presentation that you could understand. I

677
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:34,000
tried to make it as least technical as
possible so everyone can enjoy. So any

678
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:40,000
other questions?

679
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Yeah, so it's quite technical, but you
can think of, really, on the actual

680
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:53,000
usage-wise, rather than the data structure
implementation-wise, kushti mentioned that

681
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:59,000
the AVLG is actually a lot more efficient
compared to the Merkle-Patricia trie that

682
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:05,000
you have on Cardano.

683
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Meaning the proof sizes, the really
efficient means that you can do more

684
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
operations in a given transaction. The
proof sizes are smaller. The data that you

685
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,000
provide during transaction building, it's
a lot smaller. What does it mean for the

686
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,000
end user? It means that transactions
really will be cheaper.

687
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:49,000
But there is a significant implementation
difference, how it works internally. But I

688
01:15:49,000 --> 01:16:10,000
don't really know that from the top of my
head, and I can't speak for it that much.

689
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:31,000
But in the context of this, though, you
can think of it as interchangeable.

690
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Correct, correct. So, Grayman brought up
a great point. So yesterday, again, I

691
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:47,000
don't think everyone's quite active on
Twitter, but Liquid, so there's a protocol

692
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:54,000
on Cardano called Liquid Finance and it's
a lending protocol. And what they did

693
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:01,000
yesterday was because of the extreme
movement.

694
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
So I think Cardano literally went from
like 80 cents to like 27 cents in like a

695
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
flash because of like mass liquidations.
So Liquid Finance is a decentralized

696
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
lending platform, right? So you provide
some collateral in ADA and you get back an

697
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
asset. So since the price moved down so
steeply, you're going to have some

698
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,000
liquidations due to that.

699
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,000
So Liquid Finance completely shut off
their front-end interface and you can't

700
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
manage your liquidations now right no one
can liquidate you or anything and you

701
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,000
can't make new collateral requests and so
on I don't I don't know why they did this

702
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I mean obviously to protect people from
being hurt but like I don't know I think

703
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,000
everyone's like a grown man here and can
handle their finances so I think that's

704
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
kind of silly but it is what it is so yes,
they disabled the front end.

705
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:04,000
And maybe that I can make a custom
transaction using code to interact with

706
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,000
the contracts. But I actually found
Cardano's very funny. A lot of these

707
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:14,000
off-chain runners, so basically what
processes your transactions with the main

708
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,000
contract, they're actually permissioned.

709
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,000
So for people to run the off-chain bots,
you need to have like maybe you have to

710
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:30,000
own you have to be the owner of a certain
address right so only your private key can

711
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,000
actually run the transactions but what's
more common is like it's like a special

712
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:40,000
NFT right it's all NFT holders are the
ones that can run these off chain right

713
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,000
that and that's a very it's not
decentralized at all it's just made on a

714
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
decentralized platform.

715
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
So really, this is a very simple check,
right? Like you have a contract, right?

716
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
And you're like, okay, all these
calculations happen. It's decentralized.

717
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
But you add just one tiny check. Only the
owner, only the holder of this NFT can run

718
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
the transaction, right?

719
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
So technically, no. For a lot of
protocols on Cardano, no. You can't just

720
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
bypass everything and build your own
transactions with code. I can't do that

721
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
because I don't own that special NFT that
you need to actually process the

722
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
transactions.

723
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And no, this is actually like really bad.
I don't know why. It's like a very common

724
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:51,000
on Cardano. But yeah, no, it's not really
decentralized. It's the answer.

725
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Again, as Joe kept mentioning, know your
assumptions. It's something permissioned.

726
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
For example, we have the HODLerg game.
It's all open source. So if the front end

727
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
shut off, first of all, you can just spin
up your own front end because the code is

728
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,000
all there.

729
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Second, you can build your own custom
transaction and you can run your own

730
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
off-chain because all that code is open
source. It's not hiding anything and you

731
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
don't need any special NFT. Even on
Cardano, if these projects are all open

732
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
source, even if the off-chain is all open
source, the website is all open source, it

733
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
doesn't matter because you need the NFT to
actually run the off-chain.

734
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:38,000
It's literally not going to work. So it's
decentralized, it's open source, but you

735
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:49,000
can't do anything.

736
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Oh, no, that's a great question. Maybe we
can talk to Allison, who's in the back.

737
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,000
He's the Nautilus developer. But what
Grayman said is, hey, can we have a

738
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
HODLerg natively within the Nautilus
wallet itself? And I think that's really

739
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
cool.

740
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Maybe we can have a dedicated apps
section on Nautilus wallet. I think it's

741
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
already there with SigUSD. But I think a
bunch of apps within Nautilus, so you

742
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
don't have to go to any website. Right,
you you're actually technically running

743
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
your own front end right because it's a
wallet extension so you're not even

744
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
reliant on me hosting the website.

745
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
So I think that's a great idea and we can
have like a bunch of apps on Nautilus

746
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,000
where just click like two buttons and you
know you interact with the protocol. I

747
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
really like this idea because again you're
not worried about any front-end, right? If

748
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
a front-end gets hacked, what a front-end
being hacked means is that someone takes

749
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
ownership of the domain that it's on,
right?

750
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,000
And injects custom code. So maybe they
made an exact replica of my front-end. And

751
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,000
then they're like, hey, when you click
this Mint button, instead of minting,

752
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
you're transferring all your ERG to an
address, right? That's what a hack really

753
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,000
means.

754
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
So this isn't really possible if you have
something running on your own instance,

755
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,000
like on Nautilus itself. I mean, it's only
possible if you literally physically

756
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,000
download a virus, and maybe the virus does
some magic where it has control of

757
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Nautilus. But in general hacks, if my
website gets hacked, that's not going to

758
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,000
affect your Nautilus, which is running its
own app instance of HODLerg.

759
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:36,000
So that's a wonderful idea. We should
definitely get that going. All right, any

760
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:43,000
other questions, comments?

761
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Yes, yes, it's live on Cardano. And yeah,
it's called Palm-economy.io. And you can

762
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:58,000
find information about it. And it's
specifically staking for Palm Token, which

763
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:05,000
is the token for Zengate's Palmyra RWA
platform.

764
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
So currently there is no plans to do it
on Ergo and it's not up to me right but in

765
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
the future the point is that it's pretty
straightforward right because now that

766
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,000
it's done on Cardano everything maps
directly to Ergo right so since all the

767
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,000
theories studies the theory guys is what
takes a long time right getting it done

768
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
right planning it out implementation is
pretty straightforward once you have this

769
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,000
theory, right?

770
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
So that's why EVM is so successful
because you already it's been there since

771
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
what 2015 and you have so many contracts
So guess what a new fork a new L2 Base has

772
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,000
their own block coinbase has their own
blockchain you take the contracts and you

773
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,000
copy paste it always literally copy paste
and so in a similar sense, since we

774
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
already have everything ready on Cardano,
when we're ready for Ergo, we can just

775
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
take that code and translate it over to
Ergo.

776
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:08,000
So it's much more trivial compared to
making it from scratch.

777
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Yes, it's all very similar. It's not
exactly copy-paste, because on Ethereum,

778
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
it's literally a fork of the node. It's
the exact same thing. So you can actually

779
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
copy-paste the exact code and deploy it on
L2s and so on. So that's not the case for

780
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
UTXO. So you can't copy-paste it.

781
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:32,000
But the overall idea maps directly. So
you're just translating whatever Cardano

782
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:38,000
smart contract language to ErgoScript
exactly. There's less friction. There's I

783
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:44,000
mean, there's more friction than going
from like Ethereum to like an Ethereum

784
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:50,000
fork, but from like a conceptually, it's
like the same because the architecture is

785
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:56,000
the same. Yeah cheese.

786
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Yeah, I would definitely use AVL because
it's built into the contract, right? They

787
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:12,000
both serve that same abstract need of
storing data off-chain and then

788
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:19,000
verification on-chain, right? That's
really the important part. That's the only

789
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:26,000
thing that really makes this work. So AVL
tree serves the same purpose. So there's

790
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:33,000
no reason to have to use a Merkle-Patricia
trie on Ergo.

791
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:42,000
So actually, no, it's already
decentralized in the sense that you can

792
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,000
traverse through Ergo Explorer and you can
get back that original data, the

793
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:52,000
non-hashed data. And it's actually even
better than IPFS because you don't have to

794
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:57,000
do any pinning or anything. So it's
actually all there on Ergo already.

795
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:06,000
But the actual raw data that you probably
were thinking about is the tree data and

796
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:14,000
the balance data. And that cannot be
stored on IPFS or something, because it's

797
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:22,000
something that requires a database,
because you're doing database operations.

798
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
All right. Thanks for tuning in, guys.
