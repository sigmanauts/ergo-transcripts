Hi everyone, happy anniversary Ergo.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today I'm going to give you a few updates
about Gluon.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Gluon is a new stablecoin protocol and
Gluon Golden Ergo is the first

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
implementation of this protocol.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's the first autonomous gold-backed
stablecoin.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
To try it, visit gluon.gold.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
To learn more about how the protocol
works, check my previous talks in previous

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Ergo summits.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
In this talk, I will just report our
recent progress in the research and

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
development of Gluon.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
One recent good news is that
implementation of Gluon on Ergo was

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
independently audited by Krasavice Blazen
and no further vulnerabilities have been

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
found.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The audit included not only inspection of
the code, but also a simulation of the

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
protocol itself.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Here in this slide, you can see part of
the audit report and also a part of the

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Python simulation code.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
On the research side, we have already
proven five out of the six stability

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
theorems that we intend to prove.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And the last theorem is almost proven as
well.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Here you can see parts of the paper
showing the definition of the protocol,

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
lemma one, and also part of theorem one.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We are also formally verifying these
proofs in Coq.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This turned out to be much more time
consuming than we originally anticipated.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Here you can see the beginning and the
end of the formal proof of theorem five.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
As you can see, it's almost 1000 lines of
Coq code to prove this theorem.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If we finish the proofs on time, we are
planning to submit the Gluon paper with

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
all the proofs and formal verification to
the first stability workshop.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is a new academic workshop that I'm
organizing and everyone is welcome to

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
participate and submit a paper.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And the update that is probably most
relevant for users of Gluon Gold is the

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
release of the new frontend.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's still in beta and it still has some
issues, but we decided to already replace

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
the old frontend because it's already
significantly better.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Notable improvements of this new frontend
include the fact that it has no dependency

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
on a backend anymore, so it's more
decentralized.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
There's more transparency in the
calculation of fees, as you can see in

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
some of the screenshots here.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The dashboard also displays now the
protocol's state, showing information such

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
as the reserve ratio, the total value
locked, and the volume - information that

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
is relevant to decide whether to mint
stable coins or to redeem stable coins.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And also, one other thing that this
frontend has, which is something that

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
people had been asking, is a more familiar
swap style UI/UX.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's all for today.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Thanks.
