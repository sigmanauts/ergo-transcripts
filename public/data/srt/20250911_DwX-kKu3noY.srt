1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Welcome, welcome to the second weekly
Community Ergo AMA.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The new format that we're hosting
involves everybody here, which means if

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
you show up, be prepared to either ask
questions or listen or be asked questions.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Because it's an AMA for everybody and
it's a community and that's how it works.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We've got a nice crowd today with
Dimitri, kushti, Byron, and our next

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Anthony, Grayman, Blake, Starkenberg,
Faku, and Odi Bocha.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So this is gonna be great that
everybody's here. Thanks so much for

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
coming.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What's new, guys? Anybody?

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
kushti, you're muted.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A nice company here, yeah. A lot of new
face also.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It is great to see. We've got, Odi
actually just took over, if you can see,

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
where is he in this chart? He's over
there, way over there. There, my finger's

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
pointing.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
He just took over the Sigmanauts Twitter.
So hopefully we see some activity back out

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
of that Twitter. It's been dormant for a
little bit. So very excited to see what

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
he's going to bring to the table there.
Hopefully some spiciness.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Some people don't like spiciness, but I
think that's the purpose. I think that

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
account can handle some things like that
that the main account potentially can't.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So looking forward to seeing what's coming
out of there.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
How's your week been, guys?

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, also nothing bad in spiciness,
right? So it's actually attractive. Yeah,

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
that's at some point creating dramas, but
the dramas unavoidable anyway, probably,

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
right?

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It is, it is.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why to have boring dramas if you can have
spicy dramas.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh boy. We'll see what Odi does later
today. He's just going to delete the

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
account like Joe does, just done.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, boy. Yeah, no, that account could use
some dusting off, that's for sure. It's

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
always been through the hands of several
people. And everybody that's touched it

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
has done a great job and brought something
different and new. And I think everybody,

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
last I checked, everybody that's used it
still has access to it. So there's about

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
five people that can post at once and have
different voices. And it's a community

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
account. It perfectly fits that bill, so
looking forward to that, Odie. See what

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
you bring to the table.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What else? What's new on my part? It's
been a busy week here around. We've had my

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Ergo bots actually went offline for a week
or two. And I had to bring those back up.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There was some NGINX issue. But infra
machines are in the back of my car, all

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
boxed up that I showed you last week, and
ready to be shipped out. I just have to

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
swing by USPS on the way home today,
tomorrow, Friday. So those guys should see

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
that. And we'll get an increase to the P2P
infrastructure.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I spoke with Mark Glasgow over the week
and I think the next target is to infra

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
the ergoplatform.org website completely,
ergoplatform.com, simply because Google

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
charges us right up the ass for hosting.
It's pretty bad. So if we can infra that

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and get that off that, that'll save a cost
to the EF and move it to the community,

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
which is fantastic. Slowly moving in that
direction.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And on a side note as well for the
educational stuff that we were talking

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
about last week, I've further integrated
more LLMs into at least my school side

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
here. So getting more practice to what
it's going to be like in automation when

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
we finally move on to doing that with Ergo
platform content and videos and all that

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
kind of stuff. So really looking forward
to that. But I'm pacing myself. I don't

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
want to start another task before we
finish up and get the infrastructure down

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
fully stabilized. So yeah, trying to pace
that up.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What about you guys? kushti, what's new?

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So busy, as usual, composing some text
also will post in the main Telegram chat

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
just after the call. So other than that,
yeah, so busy developing and managing

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:01,000
developers in different ways, different
projects. So yeah, that's more or less it.

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's bang through the dev updates that
were yesterday real quick. I'll read them

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
off and maybe there's something to chat
about there. All right. Incoming screen

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
share, folks. There we go.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
All right. So kushti yesterday, 9.06 AM,
Ergo protocol and reference client R&D. We

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
reviewed 6.0 changes in Node, made PR with
some minor improvements, polished and

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
proposed for review second PR. Towards
sub-blocks now in Sigma SDK, will be

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
merged after design doc discussion and
approval. Next for Sigma, plan refactoring

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and extensible context to reuse our
programmable money engine and side chain,

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
off-chain environments, et cetera. And
testing along with Potato and improving

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
P2P layer for sub-blocks.

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Is Potato running a DevNet, kushti, is
that what it is?

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So I'm running seed nodes and he is
joining and then reporting. Yes, some

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
issues. Yeah, well, the last one. So I'm
also joining with my notes. So sometimes

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
it's about three notes, sometimes two. And
yeah, well, so issues he has sometimes not

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
reproducible on my site.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
kushti, how far away geologically is he
from you? I'm wondering how that affects

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
node synchronization with faster
sub-blocks.

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah, but I don't know. Oh, wait. So
Sydney is in Hetzner, the German data

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
center, probably. And then Potato, I don't
know, probably late in America.

77
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But yeah that's a good span that's a good
test. That's my guess. So but also our

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
devnet is kind of extreme so it has blocks
every 30 seconds and 60 sub-blocks per

79
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:13,000
block so yeah it means two sub-blocks a
second even so it's quite intense.

80
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh wow so you kept the 30 second devnet
when you moved to devnet and applied

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
sub-blocks there that's pretty extreme.

82
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, but that's good for
testing also.

83
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah. All right. Then you got GitCircles.
You reviewed and merged a poll. You've

84
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
agreed to use Ergo addresses instead of
secp256k1 and WishYouBalance is improving

85
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
implementation. Who's WishYouBalance?

86
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah, so a couple of new developers, so
yeah, BroEtiquette and WishYouBalance.

87
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, so WishYouBalance is actually a good
cycles idea author, and yeah, BroEtiquette

88
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,000
is, well, some contributor. So yeah, I'm
actually just reporting what they are

89
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
doing, mostly. So yeah, it's the project
after all.

90
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And so GitCircles is a project to create
kind of community currencies, but for

91
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
digital development communities where you
get tokens for committing to some

92
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
repositories. And yeah, so we will start
testing, creating well, talking manually

93
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and doing some testing transactions
manually also, just like few days. And

94
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
then yeah, the development is going on. So
there is Git bot already done as well as

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
persistence layer. So the next step is
some GitHub application and the Ergo half

96
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
chain site.

97
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And you think this would ever be able to
implement something like a DAO integration

98
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
into GitCircles to where if something is
approved on a DAO, if a merge request from

99
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
a GitHub repository is approved on the DAO
vote, then an off-chain bot executes a

100
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
push or a pull for that GitHub PR request
automatically kind of thing. Yeah, so PRs

101
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
are then voted on in the DAO, and then the
off-chain bot executes that push, that

102
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
change.

103
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So actually, open source communities
already acting as DAOs, right, just

104
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
off-chain. Usually some rules, some
maintainers, which are accepting what's

105
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
going to be merged into the main code
base, right? And then everyone can come

106
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and propose a pull request, but not every
pull request would be merged and so on.

107
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Then, yeah, well, it's kind of like hard
topic rights, governance and open source

108
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
communities.

109
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
For example, Linux rights, it's hard to
imagine still 30 years after its

110
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
development without the single leader. So
it's a big question how Linux would be

111
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
developed without Linus Torvalds. And so
on. So yeah, the same dependency is

112
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:57,000
typical for many open source communities.
Yeah, sometimes even programming languages

113
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and so on. But yeah, well, in some cases,
it's more or less polycentric like Bitcoin

114
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
rights where there are like five
developers yeah maybe the different number

115
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
now which can merge.

116
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And yeah, there is no single leader
officially, right? But yeah, in practice,

117
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
it's about one or two guys, after all, who
are making the most major decisions.

118
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's typical for DAOs, on-chain DAOs
also, right? So when you have DAOs

119
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,000
usually, yeah, there are some opinion
leaders, right? So it's actually a quite

120
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
interesting topic. So would it make sense
to bring already existing kind of DAO

121
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,000
structures like open source communities on
chain, right? And to try to build on-chain

122
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,000
DAOs or not? Maybe off-chain options are
more flexible actually.

123
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What was that, Grayman? Grayman was
saying something.

124
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I was just saying they barely get
anything done. I mean, look at all this

125
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
debate over the OP_RETURN issue. It's not
like they're significantly changing the

126
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
structure of the thing. When is Bitcoin
going to get to 1.0?

127
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah, but sometimes I think people are
dramatic there just to get a feeling of

128
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:59,000
importance right and also get recognized
for more and then charge for consultancy

129
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and appearances at conferences and so on.
So yeah, well, I witnessed the first

130
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:19,000
OP_RETURN drama a little bit back in
2014-15. And yeah, it also was more or

131
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:29,000
less the same, so a lot of unnecessary
dramatic talks and yeah, so some guys

132
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:39,000
heating the discussions on purpose, I
guess, in order to get more recognition.

133
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
There's also just the drama of the big
blocks and the schism, right? And it's all

134
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
just over one little parameter. It's not
like it's substantially changing the

135
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
nature of the technology. Before NIPoPoWs,
Ergo was different than it is now. That

136
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
changed things in a very substantial way
because it enables light clients that have

137
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
full security. So now my phone can be used
without the same assumptions that come

138
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
from spooling up a lightning channel. And
so how is that going to, how would

139
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
anything like that be implemented in
Bitcoin given their current governance and

140
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
way of developing things?

141
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah, probably no chance. So in Ergo,
yeah, so we have NIPoPoWs support from day

142
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,000
one, right? So just, well, support and
clients was lagging for some time but yeah

143
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,000
the core structure was there but yeah well
for Bitcoin there are talks since like

144
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,000
2012 about doing UTXO commitments right
which are allowing for actually a lot of

145
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,000
protocols and yeah well blockchain pruning
and support for lite clients right even if

146
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
they still have to download all the
headers in the absence of NIPoPoWs but

147
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
yeah still because all the interest spent
on some constants.

148
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It feels like we're still in our age of
heroes part of development and that it's

149
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
very hard to put that into a box of
governance. And you know, eventually

150
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
you've got to get there. I hear what
you're saying. Ultimately, the goal is to

151
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
write yourself out of a job so that you're
no longer necessary, but.

152
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
There are a number of people in this
community that are really carrying a lot

153
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
of water up the hill. And that kind is the
way it has to be. It sort of self forms a

154
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
government and people ask each other for
help because we don't have VC funding. So

155
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
we don't have daddy that we go to and ask
to keep handing out dollar bills for us to

156
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
go and buy some new machine or do some new
approach. We just have each other. And so

157
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
the governance kind of self-forms.

158
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But in the long run, if you end up like
Bitcoin, it's just ossified. It's

159
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
controlled by a group of people that
everybody agrees are sufficiently

160
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
undemanding and unchallenging that you can
just argue about things like OP_RETURN and

161
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
not have the thing grow or change. And
they'll say that that's because they just

162
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
want to be conservative. But Bitcoin is
unfinished and getting pretty old.

163
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:05,000
In early years, 2009, 2010, they actually
were quite radical even, right, about

164
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:15,000
changes. But then, yeah, well, endless
wars started and they ended up with the

165
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:25,000
current state where it's not possible to
change anything in the protocol,

166
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:35,000
basically. Especially if not proposed by
certain developers like one or two of

167
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:45,000
them. So yeah, so it's quite interesting.

168
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But yeah, in case of VCs, I think it's
simple, right? So I mean, there is some

169
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
organization, which is paying developers
and making all the decisions. But then,

170
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
yeah, it's not about community, right? So
if such term is used, so it's a little bit

171
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
fake community, I think, right? And yeah,
it's always controlled by who is signing

172
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
checks.

173
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Hey, guys. I wanted to add something a
bit about community. First of all, it's

174
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
super great to talk to you all because I
have been following for a very long time.

175
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And now it's super great to speak and at
least to be a little bit more in person

176
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
with you than usually on Twitter or
somewhere else.

177
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The project that I've been building is
MindHealer. And what I wanted to point out

178
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
is that building was one thing, and now
the most important part is marketing and

179
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
community. And it's a whole different
story, and it has its own challenges. And

180
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
the challenges are pretty unexpected, not
what I was thinking it would be. Provided

181
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
that I'm also a therapist and I have lots
of connections and friends, and I thought

182
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
it would have been much easier.

183
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But people are very reluctant because of
this impression, because of this, you

184
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
know, what people usually think about
cryptocurrencies, like scam or something

185
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
else. And those who don't have any
experience, they are very reluctant to

186
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
join and to try.

187
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And so what I'm currently thinking of is
that we have one-to-one calls at

188
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
MindHealer. So people can have one-to-one
consultations. And what I'm doing right

189
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
now is there would be group calls as well.
So they could have like seminars or

190
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
something like that. And my goal is to
make maybe some three educational classes

191
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
about Ergo for specialists who would come
so they will have understanding how it

192
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
works etc etc and over time they will
start using it more and more.

193
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But something that the community could be
really interested in is that I was

194
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
thinking, since there is such huge demand
on money that is decentralized, that is

195
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
not attached to this or that country,
maybe we should try and accelerate some

196
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
adoption because, for instance, I'm
currently in Brazil, but I've lived in

197
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
several countries.

198
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And it's super hard when you move to a
different country because you have to buy

199
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
a different SIM card. Work with banks. In
Brazil, banks can close your account

200
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
anytime without any without anything, they
just close the accounts. Maybe you didn't

201
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
pay your taxes. Maybe something else. So
we close your account. Why? Well, I don't

202
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
know. Just go to the bank and ask them.

203
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And that's the way things are. And when
you move from country to country over

204
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
time, it's a really huge, huge difficulty.
So what I thought, maybe we could try and

205
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
again, with the community, try to increase
the community. So there are some bloggers

206
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
who could potentially be very helpful, who
could work for us the way, who could do

207
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
the same job for us that Roger Ver did in
2012 for Bitcoin. So they could be

208
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
ambassadors filming how they onboard
people into Ergo, something like that.

209
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Again, it's for community to think about
it. But I really like the idea, and I

210
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
suggest that in the Russian Telegram
group. And people are kind of interesting,

211
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
not sure. So currently I'm asking, and
let's see how it goes with the bloggers, I

212
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
mean.

213
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You're suggesting hiring bloggers and
that kind of thing?

214
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Maybe hiring, maybe inviting them to join
the community so they would promote Ergo,

215
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
kind of like reality shows.

216
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So things that I found that those people
have zero interest unless you feed them

217
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
funds and money. That's what I've run
across with actually every outreach. There

218
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
are a few, like when we started the, when
dev updates a couple of years ago, I

219
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
started trying to just get influencers as
interviewers. It was kind of a tactic to

220
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
be like, hey, come talk about crypto in
your sphere and what it's like, and also

221
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
try to educate them on Ergo in the
meantime. And it was interesting talking

222
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
to some of these people.

223
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And most of the people, or actually all
of the people I talked to, were more on

224
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
the up and coming kind of thing. You know,
from the Cardano side at least, to try to

225
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
get that kind of exposure. Even, what can
I say? There's very little time or

226
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
interest that they have unless there's
something in it for them. I guess there's

227
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
a kind way to say it, right? So it's hard
to convince somebody like that to be

228
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
altruistic and come to a project that is
altruistic and open source, right? And

229
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
peer to peer, where there's no upside for
them in the future to potentially make a

230
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
ton of money off it. That's what I've
found. So it's a tough balance.

231
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Like look at how much Cardano paid SNEK
or whoever on Cardano paid, SNEK paid,

232
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
what's that guy's name, that influencer
with the long hair that he cut short

233
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
recently. Like they paid him, I think the
number is 40 grand, I think I heard

234
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
secretly that the number was $40,000.
Yeah, exactly. They paid him 40, 50 grand

235
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
to start promoting SNEK and probably gave
him a bunch of SNEK as well. So is it

236
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
worth it? I don't know.

237
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But that's about so-called crypto
bloggers, crypto KOLs, right? And usually

238
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
those are totally retarded and greedy
bastards. They are not creating valuable

239
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
content even, right? But if I understand
Dmitry's idea, right? So the idea is to

240
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
have some, I don't know, like borderless
enthusiasts, also bloggers, right? And do

241
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,000
some videos like how I make my money with
just GPU, right? Then how I can bring it

242
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
to Africa, right, Latin America without
any control and then use there.

243
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And yeah, well, I can mine my digital
gold, but yeah, I can also convert it to

244
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
stable value, right? Using stable coins,
well, gold packs, SigmaUSD. And yeah,

245
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
well, also it's possible to do
crowdfunding, right? For a blogger.

246
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Because, yeah, well, many of them are
actually doing something like day trips. I

247
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
mean, they're like travel bloggers.

248
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
The issue isn't necessarily all with
KOLs, it's that the popularity for KOLs

249
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
exists, right? So the issue is 90% of the
communities in crypto, and I don't know,

250
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
maybe even more, they're of the mindset of
we're playing with casinos, right? I mean,

251
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
look at this. It's so disgusting that look
at the incident that happened yesterday in

252
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
the US with the assassination. There were
gosh darn meme coins that were tripping

253
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
off at $1.5 million in volume with this
guy's name on it that just got

254
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
assassinated. That's what these KOLs are
targeting. They're targeting get rich

255
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
casinos.

256
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But the point is that there is no need to
spend energy, time and money on those

257
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:31,000
so-called crypto people. The idea is to
get ordinary people to trust some

258
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:42,000
decentralized money. Because the issue is
that those KOLs, well, aside of some,

259
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:53,000
well, Bitcoin maximalists, right, with
like big experience, right, some of this.

260
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So usually they are getting checks from
VCs rights to promote some, well, not so

261
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:15,000
decentralized, let's say politely, kinds
of assets, right?

262
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So, yeah, the idea is to avoid this at
all and yeah, attach to like ordinary

263
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
people. Because, well, we cannot fight,
right, with so-called crypto. We can just

264
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
build some alternative or original,
actually, vision, right?

265
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Right, right. So that's a thought,
kushti. When you get a baseline with what

266
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Dmitry is talking about, you have to try
to understand right from the get-go who

267
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
we're trying to attract. Are we trying to
attract more like buying people like us

268
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
who are in crypto for the decentralized
peer-to-peer nature of what Ergo is and

269
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
what crypto should be. Or are we trying to
attract people to pump the price of Ergo,

270
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
right? So if that's established at the
beginning, then you can target who you

271
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
want speaking for it.

272
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I wanted to tell you about the audience
that I was keeping in mind. So I dropped a

273
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
link to one of the guys that I got in
touch with and why I got in touch with

274
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
that guy. Because there is a huge, I mean,
I just was thinking about one community.

275
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm Russian, so I was thinking about
Russian community, Russian speaking

276
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
community. What's very particular about it
is that there is a huge, several hundred

277
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
thousand people who want money that is not
attached to any particular government.

278
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
They just want money.

279
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
They sometimes want to sell an apartment
here and buy it there. So their needs are

280
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
very basic. And all they know is they know
about Binance and how to use it. That's

281
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
the best case scenario. Sometimes they
know even less. They don't know anything

282
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
about decentralization. They don't know
anything about this. So they basically

283
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
want money. And I was thinking about the
audience and those travel bloggers, they

284
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
really don't know the difference between
centralized and decentralized.

285
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
We can basically showcase Ergo to a new
audience. And to show that it is cheap,

286
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
people can make money transfers. They can
use it. And then little by little, we can

287
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
educate them through those bloggers.
Again, we can do it differently. We should

288
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
target bloggers that are not exposed to
crypto at all. So they might have a wallet

289
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
for donations, but nothing more than that.
And we can make competition for bloggers,

290
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
because people who travel, they are not
usually very. So their prices are not very

291
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
high, let's put it like that. And we can
make a competition, for instance, best

292
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
explanatory video of how to install an
Ergo Wallet app and how to pay for

293
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
something on the road or something like
that.

294
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yeah, that stuff works well, I think. And
kushti also spoke a little bit about the

295
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
other method, too. And you were touching
on this, too, Dimitri, where you're not

296
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
necessarily getting an influencer, but
you're finding a leader of a project

297
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
somewhere in another country that could
utilize decentralized finance and then

298
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
maybe make them a mouthpiece for it
online, not just for Ergo, but for

299
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
utilizing decentralized peer-to-peer
finance to accomplish what they're doing

300
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and using Ergo in the meantime to do it.
So I think, yeah. Those are great. Those

301
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
are great ideas.

302
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah, but also, so, yeah, had a talk
with, wish you balance, again, GitCircles,

303
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:54,000
guys in the, so yeah, what's the plan,
right is to, yeah, first to test it and

304
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:02,000
then, to do kind of airdrop to existing
developer communities, right? So in the

305
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,000
first place to some Rust framework
building communities for frameworks used

306
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:18,000
in GitCircles and so on.

307
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,000
All right, so the idea is to issue token,
right, and to invite people to get them

308
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,000
for at least a contribution accounting
kind of tool, right? But then, yeah, it's

309
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:45,000
not that hard to start to attach
economies, right? Well, invite sponsors,

310
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:53,000
draw some sponsors and so on. I'm willing
to put some money maybe into liquidity

311
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:01,000
pools just, right? Well, you can just
reuse existing tooling. And so on. But

312
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:09,000
yeah, the idea is to target developers,
right? Not crypto people because, well,

313
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:17,000
what's the point in dealing with so-called
crypto? I mean, it's just.

314
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You know, when you are dealing with
people in crypto, it's mostly like a

315
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:37,000
competition who is louder, who is shouting
a marketing buzz at the most noisy level.

316
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And yeah, it's better to grab people from
outside, right? And bring to build,

317
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:55,000
especially developers, right? Bring to
build new economies.

318
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Ben, you don't have to raise your hand.
Just jump in, man. It's community.

319
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Well, so I don't necessarily want to
change the subject, but I want to shift

320
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,000
the focus a little bit. When I'm on X and
I see an Ergo raffle for trying to do a

321
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Maxi listing, which I think was one of the
ones that was up there the last couple of

322
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,000
months, there's something in maybe this is
because I'm not crypto enough. But I think

323
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:32,000
being here is something. But if I was able
to Apple pay $10 from my bank account to

324
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,000
an Ergo raffle, I would participate in 10
times the Ergo raffles that I already

325
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,000
participate in right and it's also like if
I could just apple pay to an Ergo raffle

326
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
it kind of turns into more of a go fund me
thing rather than hey I need to see this

327
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
raffle I need to remember this raffle then
I need to go to Coinbase I need to buy

328
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,000
some sort of coin and then I need to go to
another exchange to swap that from

329
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:14,000
whatever coin I chose to ERG and then
finally I need to shift that from the from

330
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,000
the exchange platform to my Ergo wallet
and then get that money to the Ergo

331
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,000
raffle, you know, so if like.

332
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,000
In one, this is a, it's more of a, hey, I
want to support the Ergo community, but I

333
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,000
don't want to go through 30 minutes of
problems to be able to donate $10 to this

334
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,000
raffle. So is there a way that you can.
And once again, I'm not a super dev or

335
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:00,000
anything. I can't do this, right? But is
there a way that we can make it so that

336
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,000
you could kind of turn Ergo raffle into a
GoFundMe type platform, but also have it

337
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,000
have Ergo branding to increase brand
awareness?

338
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Because the problem in crypto and
particularly with Ergo, is nobody knows

339
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,000
what it is. I mean, there's a few of us
who, I mean, for me, it was in 2021, I

340
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
heard the Charles Hoskinson Lex Friedman
podcast. He mentioned Ergo. In about 2022,

341
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I started really getting into Ergo and
believed in the mission. So I got my first

342
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,000
set of Ergo I've been a part of the
community in the last few months i've kind

343
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
of fallen off because you know sometimes
real life gets in the way of you know my

344
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,000
crypto journey but it's like the issue
isn't with.

345
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,000
The community size, it's too complicated
to be an Ergo user, simply put. Back in

346
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:20,000
the day, I was buying ADA on Coinbase
sending it to KuCoin, swapping my ADA for

347
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Ergo on KuCoin, sending it to my wallet.
And then it's like, am I really going to

348
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,000
go through all that effort and then donate
my Ergo? Maybe I'm just speaking in

349
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,000
circles. I don't know if anyone has
anything to add off of that, but it's

350
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:48,000
simply put, it's too difficult to be an
Ergo user.

351
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So you're in the US, I assume Ben?

352
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Yeah.

353
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yeah. So when I first got into Ergo as
well, Ergo felt like a scarce resource,

354
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
right? Because it was a pain to get in the
US. And I'm from New York, which is even

355
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
more restrictive, right? I had to use a
Florida address from my wife's account to

356
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
purchase Ergo from Coinbase early on, or
ADA, and then do the same path you did

357
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
until they cut us off KuCoin. So there's
an accessibility issue right there. I

358
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
agree. But my question is to you, what do
we. How are we framing that?

359
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So there's no accountability in raffles
where there's something like Apple Pay

360
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
link with cash, right? So let's say, let's
take, for example, that Ergo raffle set up

361
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
where you could donate ERGs or here's an
Apple Pay link to a cash account, right?

362
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
On Ergo piece, we can see exactly what
happens to the Ergo after the raffle

363
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
finishes. It goes to a wallet, it's used,
it's locked, whatever, who's using it kind

364
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
of thing. And with raffle two, we'll see
tokens be able to do that as well. But

365
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
with the Fiat, there's no trail
accountability or anything, right? I guess

366
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
you could demand that you see it appear on
chain after that, or what it's used for,

367
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
some accounting piece.

368
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And I appreciate your sentiment towards
transparency. But at a certain point, it's

369
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
like, we trust that GoFundMe is going to
send the funds that we send to GoFundMe to

370
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
the user. And I know this is a big thing.
You shouldn't trust. You should verify.

371
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But at a certain point, when does
verification become an inhibitor towards

372
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
growth of a product.

373
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Right, so I can see immediately when you
were speaking, ideas came to mind, like,

374
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
if we want to reach the broader community
as a Sigmanauts and we're fundraising for

375
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
something like the Ergo Meetup, I agree.
There could be, you know, here's a raffle

376
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
to fundraise this and here's a GoFundMe as
well for people who want to donate fiat.

377
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So I think that's a great idea, for sure.
But here's the problem. The base of your

378
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
idea is accessibility, which, you know,
it's always been a strain, a rough thing

379
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
for Ergo, for sure.

380
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Yeah, I also think. Yeah, sorry. Go
ahead, man.

381
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:16,000
No, go ahead. Go ahead. So I think this
is the perfect example, actually. And

382
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,000
yeah, it makes sense to maybe make a list,
right, of such like tests, right, for

383
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:30,000
accessibility. And then, yeah, so for
Raffle, in particular, also, what's

384
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
doable? So I think, well, not sure when
but this is achievable so first we need

385
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:44,000
for raffle version 2 right to have stable
coins and then yeah some bridge where you

386
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,000
can get stable coins supported on Ergo in
exchange of Apple Pay payments, right? But

387
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,000
as Grayman said in comments, so yeah, that
there is HodlCoin already with the

388
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,000
VoltPay. So maybe is it supporting Apple
Pay? Probably not, right?

389
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
No, it does not. Yeah, well, and you can
get gift cards out. But yeah, it's to go

390
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,000
from the conventional financial world and
into Ergo. then Banxa is our best bet in

391
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
the United States currently. It's not
outrageous the way that they operate, but

392
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
setting up something so that you could
just click a button and have your $10

393
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Apple Pay go into a raffle.

394
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I mean, it's just UI, UX development. The
fact that the backend is a raffle is good

395
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
for traceability. That doesn't need to be
in conflict. In fact, it could just be a

396
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
value add, but it's not being added to
anything right now because in order to

397
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
participate in an Ergo raffle, you have to
be an Ergonaut. You have to hold Ergo in a

398
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
wallet and understand how to use it. I
think Ben's making some good points.

399
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And I applaud you for going out on a limb
and doing that, Ben, on video, because we

400
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
need somebody to stand up from that
perspective and say, hey, look, this is

401
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
not about the latest technical nuance so
much as it is about making it super easy

402
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
to get people involved. Also, like what
Dimitri was saying earlier, at first I was

403
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
sort of dismissing it, but then I got his
point. Let's talk to communities outside

404
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
of Ergo and get those people to be
interested for a variety of reasons and

405
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
that'll you know any any way that you can
connect the real world and other

406
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
communities into it that's great but then
Ben said hey look that's all well and good

407
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
but then they're going to have to go
through this process of setting up a

408
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
wallet and all these other things it's a
friction that we need to overcome and the

409
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
only way to overcome it is to.

410
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Apply lubricant, right? And that's a UI
UX dev issue, and that's hard to do. You

411
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
know, kushti's given me the thumbs up here
because you can't push a rope. I mean,

412
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
he's developing, you know, the next
innovations in the core and the node. It's

413
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
hard for him to switch from that into
being somebody that writes a bot that

414
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
works with X to press a button and then
suddenly you get an Apple pay that goes to

415
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
a particular, oh, you have to do a sign
it, right? That would be nice, but it has

416
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
to be done.

417
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Sounds like a skill issue for kushti.

418
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
We need to get HQ on this call. Where has
he been? He's probably with his little

419
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
one.

420
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
He's in Pakistan probably still.

421
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Interesting.

422
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Yeah, helping some victims of floods.

423
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
The floods there are outrageous. Yeah,
outrageous, crazy. Himalayas are some of

424
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
the newest mountains in the world, and boy
are they unstable. When it rains hard, it

425
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
is hell to pay.

426
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So I'm interested to do a test, really. I
think there's probably some fundraising

427
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
opportunities and the things we can do.

428
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Oh, sorry.

429
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
No, no, I think it'd be neat. I think,
Ben, I think we're gonna, I think I'll

430
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
integrate that into at least the tech side
of the Next Ergo Raffle that the SIGs do

431
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
is do a side GoFundMe for it for fiat
users. And we'll see what happens. I think

432
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
it's a good idea. See what happens. I
mean, I'm ready to take criticism by like,

433
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
oh, you're a crypto group and you're still
using fiat to direct fiat payments kind of

434
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
thing. So that's fine, I think, but yeah.

435
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Well, it's also like, the fact of the
matter is crypto is great, and I love the

436
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,000
idea in the community, but God is it a
pain in the ass to use. If I could, I'd go

437
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:20,000
to the local pizza shop and pay with my
ERG. That'd be great. But that's so many

438
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,000
steps. That's why when.

439
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I haven't kept up with this, but Tabi
POS, that was super interesting to me. It

440
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:42,000
was like the first real, and I don't know
what the deal with Tabi POS is currently,

441
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,000
but it was the first real blockchain
product that I saw that was like, oh, this

442
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,000
is actually useful in real life. It's
like, you know, dexes are cool, kind of

443
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,000
useless to a regular person. A lot of
these things are really, and I understand

444
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:10,000
that DEXes are important on the backend to
make a lot of things work. I get that. But

445
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,000
to a regular user, to a regular person, no
one cares about a DEX.

446
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Like, my dad, for example, isn't going to
be like, oh my God, look at all these

447
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
features that this really cool DEX on Ergo
has, right? That's not taking away from

448
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
the quality of these things, right? But
it's just a fact that

449
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,000
60-something-year-old people who see
Bitcoin and they're like, oh my God,

450
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Bitcoin's a way for me to preserve my
wealth over time. Great, but then you get

451
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
like, that's like layer one, and then
like, Ergo's down here at like layer

452
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
seven. And I appreciate Ergo for being at
layer seven, but the layman is just like

453
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
money Bitcoin, money Bitcoin, money
Bitcoin. And they're never going to use

454
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
their Bitcoin in real life.

455
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Right, Ben. So, Ergo's had that
agreements and good reality check. I think

456
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Ergo's slightly aware of that and Devs
are, and you'll see that in some of the

457
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
products that come out, is that they are
transparent to the user, right? So, like,

458
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Machina's team was originally working on a
ticketing system that allows concert

459
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
tickets and things. So that you could have
on-chain governance of your ticket system

460
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
and the normal user wouldn't know. They
just download an app that had an

461
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
integrated wallet that passed the tokens
back and forth kind of thing.

462
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So I agree. I think when developers
develop, they should keep that in mind,

463
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
especially in Ergo, that people might not
want to know that they're holding Ergo per

464
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
se, but they want to know that they're
holding a product. They're using a product

465
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
that uses some crazy stable security and
peer-to-peer network. that their data and

466
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
their value is safe.

467
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yeah. And once again, I'm speaking out of
hand because I don't have the experience

468
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
to implement any of this. So if any of
this is bullshit, I'm sure some of it can

469
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
be. But it's, hey, you get them in with
the Apple Pay GoFundMe type thing. And

470
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
then that gives you the opportunity to
educate people, meeting them where they

471
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
are, rather than trying to, it's like if
I'm in New York City and you're in, I

472
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
don't know, Woodstock, New York, it's
like, how am I going to get you from

473
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Woodstock to New York City? It's, I don't
even know you, right? Like, I'm not gonna

474
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
be like, hey, come to New York City and
you're gonna come to New York City. That's

475
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
not gonna happen.

476
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Well, you brought up some really good
points, Ben. Likewise, Grayman about the

477
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
stuff he was saying. But I think it's more
or less a product of the time, because if

478
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
you rewind time, older people kind of had
a distaste for the internet. Now, if you

479
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
log on to Facebook, that's where they hang
out. So I think it's more of a UI thing,

480
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
like what Grayman would say is the ease of
access, and then also to what QX was

481
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
saying about the criticism from going from
fiat real to dual purpose. I don't see

482
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
that as a valid criticism at all, because
for us to even get into Ergo, you have to

483
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
go from your bank account to dual purpose,
right? So it's like, using Ben's point,

484
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
which is a good point. That's not a
criticism because people are They already

485
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
if you're donating to a GoFundMe. It's a
purpose.

486
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
All right, so we got our first plot
scanner of the Of the show luckily we have

487
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
his face. We can post it somewhere and
shame him. What an asshole anyway moving

488
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
on that might also just be some video that
he put up there.

489
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Oh yeah, yeah, it's not his asshole, I'm
sure. I know. He was white. He was white.

490
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The person in the video was not white.

491
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Why is there a video on his phone?

492
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I think maybe we ought to cut the feed
for YouTube before we get in trouble.

493
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I don't know.

494
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It's already there. Andy can clip it.
Andy can clip it. It's not a big deal. All

495
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
right. So before I was distracted, I even
forgot what the hell I was going to say.

496
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Demetri, what were you saying?

497
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Oh, yes. So some, yeah, so cross-chain.

498
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Yeah, so as long as the liquidity is
available on both sides, Dmitriy, so let's

499
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,000
say you want to do a raffle and broadcast
Ethereum, Binance, all those things, but

500
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
you want to use the funds on Ergo. As long
as those liquidity pools exist, then Rosen

501
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
could develop, essentially, except tokens
in Ethereum. It goes into a wallet and

502
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
then automatically transfers across the
bridge at the end of the raffle once it

503
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
knows that it's a certain amount. So yeah,
development-wise, it's totally possible

504
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
and would be totally neat. Or you could,
yeah, yeah, that would be really neat.

505
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Yeah. I'm still a little shell-shocked
from that. It's 10 o'clock.

506
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Maybe we should end on a good point. No,
don't end it yet. I want to do an

507
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
advertisement that will tie it all
together.

508
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
All right, go for it, Grayman.

509
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:44,000
It's for the Autolykos DAO and Venture
Capital Collective, which is formed

510
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,000
recently on Ergo. It's a project being led
by LifeOfIFA. And it's an experiment in

511
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:58,000
doing governance on chain in Ergo in a
sort of standard corporate form. And it's

512
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:05,000
a situation where there's a token, which
is called Lykos, which essentially

513
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:12,000
represents a share in this enterprise. And
it's been through the seed round. The next

514
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:19,000
round is the sow round. And then the round
after that is where we start funding

515
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
projects. And the first project is a
payment gateway.

516
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:33,000
And I think there have been a number of
things that we need to take into account

517
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,000
when we end up developing a spec for that,
one of them being that mixing would be

518
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:45,000
involved. But I think another would be
that it would actually be a way to accept

519
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,000
and process payment from Fiat into any
other currency, I guess, again, assuming

520
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,000
that you've got the liquidity to support
that. So that's my little advertisement

521
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:03,000
for Autolykos. It's permissionless, so you
don't need my permission to join, but

522
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,000
maybe some encouragement. The Sow Round's
coming up soon, so keep an eye out for it.

523
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Awesome.

524
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Very cool. And I think we missed those
two things I just want to mention as well

525
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
that we missed on the dev update. Nautilus
wallet has some stuff that came out.

526
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
FleetSDK upgrades. Nautilus is
investigating ledger connection issue.

527
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Machina Finance is finishing limit orders
on unit tests. Also, with speaking of

528
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
spam, like we just had spam troll just
now. Ergo's had a couple airdrops recently

529
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
of fake tokens or tokens that lead you to
a fake site that want to try to get you to

530
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
connect your wallet to.

531
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
So just a reminder to everybody that
Nautilus has those baked in, ignore spam

532
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
tokens, ignore NSFW tokens because those
come as well. So if you have those clicked

533
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
and I think they're clicked by default,
the Sigmanauts and Ergo Explorer

534
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
communities mark tokens as spam as they
come in and they're automatically hidden

535
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
from your wallet so you'll never even see
them if you utilize Nautilus for that and

536
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
then you can use Terminus wallet a mobile
wallet to burn them if you want to as well

537
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
which is great and I think HodlCoin has a
burn option on their site as well if i'm

538
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
not mistaken so just keep in mind that too
that.

539
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Nautilus is also going to integrate on
that community list, we're going to start

540
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
putting addresses there that are known
scammers so that when you send, when you

541
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
try to send funds to a known scammer
address that the community's marked as a

542
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
known scanner, Nautilus won't stop you per
se, but the idea is to pop up a little

543
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
message that says, hey buddy. This address
has been marked by the community as a

544
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
known asshole or known scammer or
whatever. Are you sure you want to do

545
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
this? And maybe a default check to no and
then you have to yes and confirm it kind

546
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
of thing. So that's a new thing coming out
of Nautilus at some point in the future

547
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
with these community lists.

548
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
If you are up at 3 a.m. and you recognize
that a spam token went out and nobody else

549
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
is awake, go ahead and submit a PR to our
GitHub or go to ErgoExplorer and find that

550
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
token and mark it as a scam as well or pop
it in chat. Someone will take care of it

551
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
this morning. We're a community and it's
up to us to keep each other safe for that

552
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
kind of thing.

553
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
All right, everybody.

554
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Actually, there are more updates. There
is also a reworked basis contract and we

555
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
have some new developers contributing
there as well. Yeah, well, let's discuss

556
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
during the next call maybe.

557
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Yeah, yeah, there's basis right there.
There's a Cyberverse update report as well

558
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
came in.

559
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Cyberverse and maybe. So yeah, let's
discuss during the next call.

560
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yeah, sounds good.

561
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
So we'll just talk about it. Every week,
Ben. I hope to see you every week, man.

562
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Come in. It's awesome to have your
opinion.

563
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And join Autolykos, Ben.

564
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Come talk to us about the idea. Dude, I
have to find my Ergo seed phrase first.

565
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Uh-oh.

566
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Create a new wallet and send your shit to
it. Well, that requires me finding my seed

567
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
phrase first. I think I got logged out of
Nautilus. I think I got logged out of

568
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Nautilus.

569
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Oh, okay.

570
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
No, I'm not logged out of Nautilus.

571
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Great. So make a new wallet and send it
ASAP. Yeah. Yep. Yep.

572
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And everybody go to Colorado if you can.

573
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Yes, I'm going to announce the first two
speakers. I'll announce maybe today or

574
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
tomorrow, the third speaker, three out of
three out of the six speakers or seven

575
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
speakers we have. Please come. It's going
to be a lot of fun. We're going to live

576
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
stream everything, but we'd love to have
you guys here in person.

577
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
The Twitter stuff.

578
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Yes, thank you, Adi. October 11th then.
So people are showing up Friday, October

579
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,000
11th is Saturday, and then there's a
breakfast, community breakfast thing on

580
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Sunday as well if people are still around.
Yeah, it's gonna be fun. Later.

581
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And everybody check out Dimitri. Oh, he
just left. He was developed. Oh, he's

582
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
right there. Your picture. I'm here.
MindHealer as well. I've poked around it

583
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
kind of thing. But super, super
interesting idea.

584
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Thanks, thanks. Yeah, so let's discuss
MindHealer maybe also.

585
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Yeah, pop into that chat, Dmitri, and
talk about it as well. Yeah, Grayman.

586
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Grayman will bring it down. There's not
enough ERG in the world for Grayman

587
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
sessions.

588
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
All right, everybody, it's been awesome.
I love these community talks. I think

589
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
they're a step up in what Ergo is, so
fantastic. kushti, any closing words?

590
