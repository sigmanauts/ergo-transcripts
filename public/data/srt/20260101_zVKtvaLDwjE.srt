1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Alright, welcome everybody.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's kind of an annual thing where we do
a closeout for the year.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Cover the progress that we made in the
Ergo ecosystem.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Some of the community-driven
advancements, development verticals,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
thoughts.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's been a good year, I would say, in
terms of what we delivered.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
There's certainly a lot that we're still
chasing, but we could start with something

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
like ChainCash, Basis, those are both
monetary frameworks that we've kind of

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
been hallucinating about for what, three
years?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, three or four, yeah, more or less.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, so that idea of putting together
kind of this off-chain cash allowing for

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
elasticity, credit expansion, kind of
peer-to-peer, potentially bot-to-bot,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
AI-to-AI, these type of ideas we've been
talking about for quite a while, right?

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We have seen some kind of a traction in
the space around that more broadly, but I

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
would say that our community effort

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
ChainCash basis.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The idea of these credit systems and kind
of putting the foundation in place have

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
been incredibly valuable and I think will
deliver real tooling for people long term.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
All right, yeah.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So I believe it started even from like
2019, right?

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Back then it was idea to do LETS - local
exchange trading system.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And then kind of LETS constellation but
then after some thoughts and yeah well

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,000
LETS a couple of designs were published
back in early 2019 so there was initial

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
blog post by me then of Amitabh so we
published designs for

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
like ordinary LETS, so
non-collateralized, purely trust-based,

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and yeah, Amitabh did collateralized
version.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But yeah, well, it wasn't by design even
flexible enough, right?

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So yeah, well, it's generalization,
ChainCash appeared.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So yeah, we discussed the initial design
back in like,

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:53,000
late 22, I believe, with Amitabh, but,
yeah, well, unfortunately, he stopped to

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:04,000
do his parts quite quickly, and, yeah,
well, Papa passed away in 24, early 24.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But, yeah, then there were a few
iterations, well,

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
most of it stabilized in 2023, most of
ChainCash.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But then, yeah, well, this year, so just
very early thoughts on basis of chain

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
version.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And yeah, well, this year, finally some
significant progress got made.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So after all, there is some working

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Tooling, right, which I'm testing, so
it's a very prototype and yeah, well, just

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
ready for some demos now, some initial
tests, but we're already planning to do

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
some with it.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
like purely local payments well with
blockchain reserves anyway right so when

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,000
you can go into forest and just do
payments over mesh network so yeah we are

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
considering such a demo and then and yeah
so and when you're

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
leaving the forest, right, but back to
connectivity, you can redeem, right, the

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
notes in the woods, basically.

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So yeah, well, something like that, and
we can consider applications like

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
agent-to-agent payments.

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We discussed some things with Hosimi.

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
like integrating into his peer-to-peer
network, chill out, and so on, so on, so

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
on.

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, well, a lot of interesting things
can be done.

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Then, yeah, I think subblogs, right?

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Another big topic for 2025.

54
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So for months, we have DevNets under
testing and well, white paper is more or

55
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
less ready, aside of security.

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
sections.

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So yeah, well, we'll start to send out to
peers and then after New Year Eve, well,

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
there will be a public white paper, listen
discussions and then yeah, we can think

59
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
about deployment.

60
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Based on discussions.

61
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So yeah, and well, I think another quite
exciting thing is that, yeah, we had

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
unstoppable hackathon, right?

63
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And aside of that, I see actually a lot
of new faces in development, like Super

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Ellipse updated Ergo wallet, finally.

65
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Then, yeah, well, there are some other
developers, some new faces.

66
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So yeah, that's quite exciting.

67
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And yeah, also a lot of interesting
projects, right, in the community, such as

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
use and yeah, well, sorry, GetCircles and
so on.

69
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, go ahead.

70
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Who was that?

71
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I was going to say it was a good year for
kind of derivatives, right?

72
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We saw Dexy Gold launch.

73
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We saw Gluon come out.

74
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We saw the use stablecoin come together.

75
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That'd be good to have you hop on and
give us your feedback in terms of how

76
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
you're feeling about use and what you
expect going into 2026.

77
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah, let me give overall my thoughts
about the industry and what happened in

78
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
2025.

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So first of all, thanks for inviting me
to this end of year podcast.

80
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And I'd like to step back a little bit
and look at the blockchain industry as a

81
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
whole.

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So earlier this year, as some of you
know, I attended Cardano Summit in Berlin.

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I was actually quite well organized, but
I felt a little bit disappointed by many

84
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
of the discussions.

85
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So during the several panel sessions,
speakers were asked a very simple

86
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
question.

87
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What is the blockchain industry actually
for?

88
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So what's the meaning of it, right?

89
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And many of the answers I heard felt
completely disconnected.

90
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
For example, one panelist said that when
you go to the petrol station to collect

91
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
bonus points for fueling your car,
blockchain could make it easier and faster

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
to manage those rewards.

93
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So, you know, things like that, answers
like that you hear in Berlin during quite

94
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
a big summit.

95
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The impression that I got from it was
that very few people generally understand

96
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
what the blockchain industry is for, what
is it meant to achieve.

97
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So we would all agree that blockchain is
here to create better money.

98
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So, but better money, what does it mean?

99
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
People may have differences of opinion
about

100
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
what actually better money is.

101
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So in my opinion, there are three
fundamental challenges that blockchain

102
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
industry can solve to get us closer to a
better money dimension.

103
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So I have this in my mind three big
problems.

104
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So problem number one is creating a
secure decentralized ledger with finite

105
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
supply.

106
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The first and the most important
challenge is creating a secure and

107
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
decentralized supply.

108
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
No one has solved this problem.

109
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Many people understand that Bitcoin, in a
sense, is kicking the can down the road.

110
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
At some point, its security model needs
to be addressed.

111
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Ethereum and Solana, on the other hand,
have removed their hard cap supply

112
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
altogether and just keep printing money.

113
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Cardano takes a different approach in
subsidizing network security through

114
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
issuing new coins to stake pool operators.

115
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So, for example, stake pool operators
will be getting rewards for validating

116
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Cardano and Midnight and potentially other
side chains, but essentially it again

117
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
comes down to printing new money.

118
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Ergo has a different path.

119
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It introduced demurrage.

120
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
However, we still need to fully
understand its impact.

121
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So this is the biggest problem that our
industry is trying to solve and no one has

122
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
come close to it, I think.

123
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Now, the second problem is out of three
is a scalable algorithmic stablecoin, in

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
my opinion.

125
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So this issue is massive for the industry
to take.

126
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And we already seen one major attempt
that failed catastrophically.

127
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And everyone else hasn't come even close
to solving this problem.

128
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Currently, centralized stablecoins
dominate the market.

129
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So creating decentralized immutable
stablecoin is not optional.

130
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It is a global objective that can
actually change the world, in my opinion.

131
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This is the industry's second great
challenge.

132
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And the number three is the private and
fair DeFi.

133
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So with equal access to everybody, this
problem has some smaller components.

134
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And to be fair, industry has made some
real progress here.

135
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So for example, AMMs, automated market
makers, I would say it's one of the

136
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
biggest achievements of the industry so
far, but there's a long way to go.

137
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
A large part of the DeFi must move from
fully public ledger to privacy preserving

138
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
systems and obviously you cannot build a
private DeFi using something like USDC and

139
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
the list goes on.

140
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So these three problems are for years

141
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
for our industry to take.

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Obviously, the industry can help with
things like tracing stuff or moving

143
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
real-world assets on the blockchain and
many other things.

144
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But I don't think they're

145
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
as big as the three that I described
above.

146
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Now, when talking about me, myself,
personally, and my plans and what we have

147
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
done in 2025, obviously, I want to focus
on the problem number two, which is a

148
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
scalable algorithmic stablecoin.

149
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Like I said, there was only one attempt
that failed catastrophically and as we can

150
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
see now and analyze platforms like
DefiLlama, there is no one even trying to

151
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
focus on this challenge now.

152
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Everyone gave up pretty much and
centralized stablecoins dominate and

153
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
basically they are ruining the whole idea
of DeFi.

154
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
How can you have even DeFi if in the core
of DeFi you have a centralized

155
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
stablecoin issuer who can freeze and
seize your money at any point, right?

156
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So yes, now we came up with this very
interesting design Dexy and its

157
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
implementation Dexy use or use let's say
and

158
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
To me, looking with the eyes of someone
who's been in the market for quite a long

159
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
time and been trading a lot, I see a lot
of potential in this design.

160
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't want to go into details during
this podcast, otherwise it will take a

161
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
long time.

162
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But basically, yes, I see a lot of
potential.

163
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,000
2026 will be fully focused on developing
this protocol, growing TVL.

164
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Like I said, the first million use in
circulation is the biggest milestone.

165
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
After that, it will get faster.

166
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I have a detailed roadmap in my head what
I want to implement.

167
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But that would be my main focus.

168
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And I'm happy to discuss more if a
question arises.

169
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But I can say that I smell some blood
here.

170
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
This is really unique stuff that we're
building here on Ergo.

171
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Thanks.

172
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
All right.

173
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
All right.

174
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So Richard, do you want to accept some
questions?

175
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Maybe so I'm reading telegram chats, the
main and there are some questions to you.

176
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah, absolutely.

177
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah.

178
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So the question is, yeah, what are your
plans about Crux, which you acquired

179
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
recently?

180
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes, so what happened with Crux, I was
looking for a platform to develop use, to

181
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
focus on developing use.

182
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And I checked some options and rather
than building something from scratch, I

183
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
thought it would be a good idea to pick up
a project that was kind of stalled, it was

184
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
not developing at all, so kind of
considered to be dead.

185
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But actually,

186
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
few people use it.

187
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It has a nice dashboard.

188
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So I reached out to the previous owners
of the project and they were quite

189
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
collaborative.

190
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So they passed the ownership to me.

191
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So my plans with the Crux Finance is to
keep it as

192
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
as a platform as it is right now and
develop it, so-called like a top tools

193
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
type of a platform.

194
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I want people to be, when visiting Ergo
first and trying to understand what

195
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
projects do we have on Ergo, visit Crux
Finance first, but I will also make it

196
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
use-centric.

197
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So use would be the main trading pair.

198
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I want to build a bank monitor there
where people will see how bank reserves

199
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
behave over time.

200
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So to give them more confidence that use
is fully collateralized project that we

201
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
have reserves and how reserves behave that
the bank actually accumulating resources.

202
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So I want one dedicated page there.

203
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It will preserve all the current
functions.

204
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I was surprised, but quite a few people
use Crux to fill their taxes, so we will

205
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
keep that feature.

206
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
People can continue using it.

207
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So things like that.

208
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And overall, I have some DeFi ideas and
some events that will be coming in 2026,

209
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
similar to CLB event.

210
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And when the right time comes, we will
host events like CLB on top of Crux now.

211
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So that's basically the plan.

212
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The token will be used for different
activities.

213
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Now you can pay for transaction fees with
tokens.

214
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So that's already a good start and we
will add more features in the future.

215
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But that's not the main purpose.

216
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The main purpose for me is to develop use
and build TVL and cross-chain liquidity

217
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
with use.

218
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's my main focus for 2026.

219
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah, that was great.

220
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Your trilemma, I don't know, people look
to liquidity for answers and I think a lot

221
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
of the actual solutions to what is good
money and what is going to be a solid,

222
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
scalable, stablecoin design and what is
privacy going to look like, a lot of those

223
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
break down to architecture.

224
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
in terms of how the solution is
presented.

225
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
We do live in the market space where
people look at noise and liquidity much

226
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
more than architecture.

227
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I do think those are really deep
questions to consider in terms of what's

228
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
the architecture of good money.

229
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Same is true with privacy assumptions.

230
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That's becoming more popular and there
are a lot of different paths to create and

231
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
enhance privacy.

232
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But when noise and liquidity are driving
markets instead of architecture and design

233
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and systems, I think we're going to
continually fail to deliver something

234
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
meaningful.

235
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Correct, Joe.

236
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
We definitely pivoted in the wrong
direction.

237
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I feel like we are helpless kinda.

238
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So there's nothing better than that
industry can come up with.

239
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So you look at the hyperliquid.

240
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's a very good example.

241
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,000
They came up with a decentralized
perpetual DEX, right?

242
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Six months after they came over, let's
say one year, we have plenty.

243
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I lost the count, probably 20 of them
now.

244
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
They're just popping like mushrooms.

245
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
There's nothing else in the industry.

246
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
They lost their idea.

247
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
They're not innovating really.

248
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Only one or two good projects come up.

249
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
here and there, but no one is really
focusing on the fundamentals.

250
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
No one is trying to solve algorithmic
stablecoin.

251
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
That's really frustrating.

252
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
No one is trying to create a secure
ledger with finite supply.

253
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Everyone just keeps printing money.

254
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Privacy kind of started moving a little
bit with Zcash giving a little bit of

255
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
boost and Night now catching up.

256
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But we'll see just a simple privacy and
the private smart contracts are very

257
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
completely different beasts.

258
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But at least there's something going on
there.

259
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes, industry feels and actually the
price actually reflects where the industry

260
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
innovation is.

261
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Innovation of the whole industry is in a
very low point and price reflects it now.

262
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So we need to get back to fundamentals
and we need to start challenging status

263
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
quo as a trade fight.

264
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and try to solve real problems.

265
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And I think here on Ergo, though not many
people know about our project, but here on

266
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Ergo, I think we're on the right path for
many of these challenges.

267
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I hope we're on the right path.

268
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I would at least say that I think we
asked the right questions, right?

269
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Not necessarily that we have found the
absolute correct solutions.

270
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That's always going to be something that
time shows.

271
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But, you know, take Hyperliquid as an
example.

272
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I have no idea how it works.

273
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I can't see, right?

274
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So I don't understand what the
architecture is, and frankly, nobody

275
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
outside the team does.

276
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
which is kind of wild to consider, but
that's where, you know, quote unquote,

277
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
DeFi is.

278
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Now, I do think we have, you know, made
some good progress as an ecosystem.

279
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You know, you can say Duckpools is
something that is always in the background

280
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
building.

281
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I think V2 is going to be quite exciting
as that rolls out.

282
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And we can see the architecture there.

283
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We can understand what's happening.

284
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And so that allows us not just the
developers, but as a user base and as a

285
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
community potentially to offer direct
feedback in terms of design and

286
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
functionality that wants to be seen.

287
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You know, with Rosen Bridge, that's a
work in progress.

288
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But 2025, we did actually integrate into
Binance Smart Chain first.

289
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I think that was February, February,
March in there.

290
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
We've created the first, let's say, meta
protocol on Bitcoin that kind of cleanly

291
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
moves assets in and out.

292
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That's not something we've fully
developed in terms of market function yet,

293
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
but the underlying potential is quite
interesting there.

294
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
This ability to move beyond proof of work
mining pools and kind of promote

295
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
individual miner control is something that
the proof of work space has been chasing

296
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
for, I don't know, since 2011, 2012 when
pooling appeared, right?

297
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I think we have some quite interesting
solutions to big problems in the space.

298
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Now, unfortunately, I would say that
attention and liquidity are kind of their

299
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
own animals in the crypto space that take
away from

300
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I don't know, the underlying value of
kind of like architecture and distribution

301
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
of power and a lot of these underlying
mechanics that ultimately build solid

302
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
solutions, in my opinion.

303
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But I think 2026 could be a good year.

304
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm excited to see this idea of, you
know, sigma chains merge mining, trying

305
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
to, you know, kind of move in the
direction of some of the Bitcoin

306
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
proposals, but with a lot stronger systems
than Bitcoin is currently capable of.

307
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
We did actually see our first Fiat on and
on off-ramp that was integrated into a

308
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
wallet, which is pretty cool.

309
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
A lot of people were asking for that for
some time.

310
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You know, with Machina, I do think that
we're going to have a quite interesting

311
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
peer-to-peer DEX design that, you know, is
something that could potentially support a

312
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
lot on top of it, right?

313
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So in the broader focus, I'm pretty happy
with what we've got done.

314
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I can't say that everybody is going to be
happy with markets, but the crypto market

315
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
is in kind of a weird space, to be honest.

316
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I would say many times I feel like a
stranger kind of reading through the

317
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
latest that people are discussing.

318
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah, so, but I think after all markets
are right.

319
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So yeah, it can be seen our 2025, right?

320
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So a lot of VC rag pools starting with,
oh, I don't know, Mantra DAO probably or

321
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
any other rag pools.

322
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But yeah, closer to end of the year,

323
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I witnessed some events when VCs just
immediately dumped assets they invested in

324
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:17,000
right after unlock, so basically
kick-killing projects immediately.

325
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
So yeah, that's a little bit surreal,
right?

326
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So if you invest into some projects, why
to kill it like immediately?

327
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:40,000
like normal VC industry, general tech, so
they wait for like five to 10 years,

328
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:48,000
right, before, well, planning exit and
executing it.

329
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:57,000
VCs are not even VCs if we are talking
about traditional VCs from Silicon Valley

330
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:05,000
originally and so on.

331
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
They are not investing in

332
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
ideas or technologies.

333
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:21,000
They're just buying tokens with some
discounts and then selling immediately.

334
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Well, it seems after all markets are
rational, but in the long term only.

335
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It seems many people are now running away
from all those projects.

336
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Think about it.

337
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
If we go back to Richie's first
challenge, what is better money?

338
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I don't think better money is something
with massive insider seigniorage that are

339
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
looking for an exit for profit, right?

340
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:01,000
That's not a core tenant of money that's
going to be sustainable in the long term.

341
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I don't think that's like a

342
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I don't know, controversial to say, it
just doesn't fit within the framework of

343
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
what is money.

344
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Like I'm going to print 80% of the supply
and sell it to you and then try to exit.

345
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Right, I mean, so if we are talking about
money or even assets, right, some more

346
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
broad things, maybe.

347
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So yeah, it's a very strange beast.

348
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So someone is coming basically to me and
saying, well, I've just printed

349
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
those assets, well, tokens, basically
private money like 80% to my personal

350
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
pocket.

351
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So buy it.

352
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And well, if I'm asking why should I buy
them, I just hear some, I don't know,

353
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
complete nonsense like Web3 something and
so on.

354
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
That's where we get into this idea of
noise and liquidity.

355
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:16,000
You can fool maybe people once or twice,
but after all markets stopped buying this,

356
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:26,000
so it's not possible to extract.

357
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And yeah, I mean, even, yeah, well, those
selling pitches like Web3, something.

358
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So when I am starting to ask like this
new breed of crypto world,

359
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I mean, what's Web3 is and why do I need
it, right?

360
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So, well, with Bitcoin, it was clear,
right, from first seconds when I've seen

361
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Bitcoin Foundation Twitter back in early
2011.

362
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Well, it was immediately clear, I mean,
what is this and what is potential of

363
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
money without central banks, right?

364
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Like peer-to-peer money.

365
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
without trusted parties.

366
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
So even if you don't understand any
details, right?

367
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So well, that's powerful pitch.

368
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And well, when someone is trying to pitch
Web3 something, I just don't know, I mean,

369
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
how to use it.

370
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Why is it needed at all?

371
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So yeah, and

372
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Joe, so what's Rosen-Lethos projects you
are involved with done in 2025?

373
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Well, I would say after, what, two, three
years, you know, Lethos launched its first

374
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
version of Testnet.

375
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
We have had pretty decent participation
thus far.

376
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Right now, we're getting ready to release
the third version, which is going to have

377
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
some additional fraud proofs kind of
update and be optimized.

378
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
You know, that's quite an interesting
problem to solve, right?

379
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Pooling in proof of work appeared because
people want to minimize variance of

380
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
payout.

381
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
If you're going to run some sort of
business, you want some form of stable

382
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
return.

383
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And so it's a predictability problem
that's economic at the end of the day.

384
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Now, the solution for that or the
architecture of the solution for that

385
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
economic problem was just to centralize
hashrate, which has terrible secondary

386
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
consequences.

387
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
First, it affects settlement.

388
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
As hashrate is more concentrated, your
assumptions of settlement as blocks are

389
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
added gets worse.

390
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
If you're interacting with the system,
your security assumptions change the more

391
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
centralized the chain is.

392
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
The secondary toxic side effect is this
idea of censorship.

393
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
We've already seen that proposed anyway
and partially implemented in Bitcoin in

394
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
2020, but that had some kickback.

395
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
We saw it in Ethereum where they had
their OFAC compliant block producers.

396
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And as you look at the market that's kind
of shifting towards these public mining

397
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
companies, I don't see that as that big of
a leap.

398
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
to kind of bring these censorship vectors
into quote unquote decentralized systems

399
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
because of where their footprint is.

400
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And for me, that's concerning because it
defeats the entire point, right?

401
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Like that's an architectural decision
that just fails.

402
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It brings up a bunch of second order
effects that are toxic.

403
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So Lethos is an attempt to kind of
democratize mining.

404
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It does, in a way, I've been thinking
about it in some senses like a hardware

405
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
DAO, right?

406
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Where you do have kind of like this
finite state machine or set of contracts

407
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
that

408
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Enforce honesty and in terms of a miner
shares their payouts and you're replacing

409
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
a third party that's anchored in some
jurisdiction that could have some attack

410
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
vector to an actual

411
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
system of smart contracts, which are more
self-enforcing, which is powerful if you

412
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
really think about it.

413
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I think the architecture decision there
is a great improvement over what is

414
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
generally around.

415
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
With ROSEN, one of the things that I
really wanted to see in 2025 was open

416
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
contribution standards.

417
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Sometimes it's very hard to know how
these systems work because the

418
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
architecture is

419
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
basically a secret.

420
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So having open contribution standards not
only allows external developers to really

421
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
dig in and understand how does Rosen
Bridge operate, why is it designed the way

422
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
it's designed, but then you open the door
for people to participate in that

423
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
architecture.

424
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And so we have a couple of chains,
Handshake, Fiero,

425
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:02,000
that have been actively implementing and
kind of building based on those standards.

426
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
We do have Nervos, which is currently
kind of in the process of voting for a

427
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
grant for their developers to build into
ROSEN, which I think is great to see.

428
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
We've released some research on the
initial implementation of the Monero

429
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
network, which is a pretty strong privacy
network.

430
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And so having like that architecture in
the open and being able to like openly

431
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
discuss, share, and kind of learn from
other projects, I think is incredibly

432
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
valuable.

433
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
So with Rosen Bridge, I would actually
say that was our biggest win.

434
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I know Binance Smart Chain is, you know,
potentially a really good base for

435
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
liquidity, but it is an exchange
environment.

436
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
They say they're not, but okay.

437
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I don't necessarily see how that's
possible given, you know, some of the

438
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
things that go on there.

439
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I do think that building on Bitcoin as
well is quite interesting because you do

440
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
have, for lack of a better word, the
largest pool of censorship resistant

441
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
capital on the planet, right?

442
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
That is the Bitcoin network.

443
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And so having additional uses that are
kind of brought in that access that

444
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
liquidity potentially is quite interesting
long term.

445
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
In terms of 2026, I think that it would
be nice to see Monero.

446
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
They need to upgrade their network.

447
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
There's a lot going on there.

448
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Base is quite interesting as it's a way
to get a footprint into the Coinbase

449
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
ecosystem.

450
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I did actually propose two Catalyst
proposals.

451
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
There's interest for people in the
Cardano ecosystem to potentially back end

452
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
an exchange environment instead of waiting
for somebody else to open the door for

453
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
them, which doesn't seem to be the
trajectory of how the ecosystem is growing

454
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
more broadly.

455
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It's interesting to look at how crypto is
changing.

456
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It does seem as though these entities are
trying to vertically integrate everything

457
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,000
into their own stack, but I guess that's
somewhat natural given greater permission.

458
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,000
In 2026, another interesting thing we're
going to work on in ROSEN is Raffle v2.

459
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's going to be an extension of the
first raffle protocol.

460
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
We're going to try to create greater
access for cross-chain liquidity to be

461
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
able to access these contracts.

462
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
You're going to have multi-winner
support.

463
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
In my mind, I've always said, okay, if I
can go to the gas station here and I can

464
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
buy the Colorado State Lottery ticket,
could I flip it over and you see the

465
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
payout odds?

466
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Could I just replicate that and in
essence create the exact same game with

467
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
enforceable honesty that's open and say,
okay, here's a cross-chain lottery system

468
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
that, you know, I wouldn't even have to be
creative.

469
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I could just clone what's already around.

470
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Interesting thought long term.

471
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
perhaps.

472
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But I do think that those type of
community fundraising tools, gambling

473
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
tools, etc.

474
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
have some demand.

475
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So let's see what people use them for.

476
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I would be happiest if I just saw
nonprofits around the world be able to

477
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:09,000
say, hey, we can actually use these as
fundraising tools to do some good.

478
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Right.

479
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And so, yeah, about the exchange
environment.

480
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Actually, it's an environment for
different exchanges.

481
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Right now, you already can arbitrage.

482
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:36,000
But yeah, probably in limited just one
way via ERG and

483
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
ERG on GATE, for example.

484
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
So on GATE, you can find liquidity pool
on BSC.

485
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
So RS-ERG to USDT, right?

486
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And yeah, you can trade directly from
your gate.io balance, spot balance even.

487
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So no need to transfer to a different
kind of,

488
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
accounts and so on.

489
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So you can just buy from spot accounts,
spot balance.

490
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I do think those aggregators will get
more interesting as we grow.

491
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Yeah, and then maybe it's already
available on BitGet, this BSC pool and

492
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
that would be great because BitGet is
popular in some countries such as

493
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Indonesia and CIS countries.

494
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So yeah, that would be great to see at
least in arbitrage form.

495
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Ergo on different centralized exchanges
via liquidity pools on BSC and other

496
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
chains.

497
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:08,000
That's quite interesting, because in 2025
many exchanges failed, unfortunately, so

498
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:19,000
we lost Zgex, and then TradeOgre probably
was the biggest loss in 2025.

499
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
it got shut down by police.

500
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So yeah, huge loss for proof of work
assets.

501
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Actually for many of them, it was the
only exchange and there is no any

502
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
replacement seen yet as far as I know,
right?

503
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So yeah, big loss.

504
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And well, then naturally a lot of proof
of work assets will go already going

505
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000
centralized rails right like Firo already
integrating handshake and so on because

506
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:02,000
for proof of work assets it's quite hard
to get on centralized exchanges especially

507
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,000
biggest ones these days because well for
some of them as we know well there is need

508
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:16,000
to pay not just in

509
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Not just some fixed amount in fiat, but
also transfer some percent of supply and

510
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,000
this is insane requirements when it's
mined.

511
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So someone needs to buy from miners to
donate to centralized exchange.

512
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It's a crazy assumption.

513
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
It breaks any notion of what is good or
better money.

514
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Something where you're going to print a
bunch of the supply in your own pocket and

515
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
then you have to go around and bribe
intermediaries to interact with it.

516
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:04,000
That's insane in terms of base
assumptions of good decentralized money.

517
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
But that's where we are.

518
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I don't know.

519
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Right, so yeah, actually, those exchanges
are just pushing for worse kinds of money

520
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
to be created, right?

521
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Yeah.

522
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
They're moving the whole industry here.

523
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Well, kind of failed also in 2025, right?

524
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
So, well, there was a lot of heat towards

525
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:41,000
So some biggest exchanges in the space,
if you avoid to call names.

526
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But yeah, it's everywhere.

527
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It's in the news and Twitter.

528
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So yeah, you can find a lot of heat
around and yeah, well, especially about

529
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,000
October 10th, right?

530
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And so on.

531
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
So yeah, it was crazy year after all.

532
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
But yeah, in Ergo, it was more or less
stable, right?

533
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So I mean, from what I've seen, not any
big dramas, whatever.

534
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So just development, right?

535
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So 6.0 activation.

536
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Yeah, well, sublogs development, DevNets
testing, and yeah, a lot of new products.

537
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Some of them we've discussed already.

538
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
More coming.

539
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
For example, you mentioned Gluon, so
currently we have Gluon Gold only, right,

540
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
and Gluon USD is coming.

541
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And then there is need for stable pools,
stable to stable liquidity pools.

542
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And well, I'm thinking to announce a
bounty for that.

543
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Yeah, well, a lot of interesting
developments in funding.

544
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:20,000
So there were a few successful
fundraisings for development.

545
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Thanks to ones who donate.

546
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And then, yeah, well, development-wise, I
think, yeah, well, things are going quite

547
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:45,000
well, so maybe better than in 2024,
probably yes.

548
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Yeah, and going back to BSC.

549
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:59,000
So, Richard, as far as I know, all your
plans for use also BSC centric, right?

550
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Yeah, just to.

551
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
elaborate more on the topic.

552
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
If you know, Coinbase announced that they
will be integrating all Solana DEXes into

553
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
it.

554
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So if we breach to Solana, for example,
then all our assets on Solana will be

555
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
available on Coinbase natively, like

556
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
ERG is available on GATE, like you said,
the same thing will be on Coinbase.

557
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Now Binance also has Binance chain DEX
inside Binance, but they do only selective

558
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
coins.

559
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
So at the moment I wanted to see if use
will appear on Binance by default, on

560
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Binance Alpha by default, but it will not.

561
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
So Binance has a kind of filter there,

562
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
But Coinbase apparently will, that's what
they announced, they will allow all Solana

563
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
decentralized, Solana tokens to appear on
Coinbase.

564
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:06,000
So if we at some point connect Solana to
our bridge, then for example, the pair

565
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:14,000
like rsERG, USDT or use USDT will appear
on Coinbase natively.

566
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
That's quite exciting.

567
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
At the moment, yes, I plan to start
strapping liquidity starting from actually

568
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
January 1st.

569
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So consider this is an announcement.

570
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
On January 1st, we will have first
bridged use and use USDT pair with a

571
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
concentrated liquidity on Binance chain.

572
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And some miners already expressed their
excitement that they can mine directly on

573
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
their Ergo wallet and in a 100%
decentralized way transfer with the Rosen

574
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Bridge.

575
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
They might actually sell their ERGs to
use and transfer their use to Binance

576
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
chain.

577
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
with low fees and completely
decentralized way and then cash out on

578
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
USDT bypassing all centralized exchanges.

579
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So we are trying to create a structure
that will replace TradeOgre and other

580
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
exchanges for miners.

581
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It's quite exciting to see if people will
use it.

582
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I hope they will.

583
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
So that's one thing I'm really excited
about.

584
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And all the other proof-of-work chains
that are currently integrating into ROSEN,

585
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
also it's very interesting to see if they
will also embrace that use framework into

586
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
their communities.

587
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,000
If they will start using use, if some of
these chains have DEXes, maybe we can kind

588
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,000
of export use to their native blockchain.

589
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
If they don't have DEXes, then we can
integrate their tokens to Ergo and then

590
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
create a pair with use.

591
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
So anyway, there are so many options and
I think all of that will be beneficial for

592
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
all the projects that are integrating to
Rosen Bridge.

593
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
So yeah, that's my take on it.

594
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I can say a couple words about my
expectations from 2026.

595
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So in terms of core development,
obviously I'm waiting for the fast block.

596
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Fast block will allow us on the next
level, DeFi on Ergo natively.

597
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
So we don't need to kind of look for the
fast trading environment somewhere outside

598
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
of Ergo to create this liquidity rails.

599
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It will be much easier to bring assets
into Ergo and then connect different

600
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
trading frameworks, trading bots to it.

601
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And I also want everyone to keep an eye
on our security assumptions as we will

602
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
grow

603
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
cross-chain liquidity.

604
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
In 2026, I have no doubts that we will
start growing cross-chain liquidity.

605
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Now, the main liquidity pool is rsERG
with ADA, but I think in 2026, I have big

606
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,000
expectations for use and maybe some other
assets to grow more liquidity with ROSEN.

607
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
So, we just need to remember about
security assumptions here.

608
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
And yeah, we actually were talking with
Alex discussing some possible enhancements

609
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
to use protocol.

610
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Maybe at some point, if Alex finds time,
we will add maybe one or two contracts

611
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
there if it depends on the complexity, but
we'll see.

612
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Even right now, it performs very well.

613
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
It grows reserves, but I think it can be
done even better.

614
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And yes, and the privacy with use is
something that we need also to explore.

615
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,000
This is definitely something big, maybe
not for 2026, maybe later, but something

616
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I'll be definitely looking into, see if we
can add any additional privacy to use.

617
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
This is my expectation for core
development.

618
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And for ROSEN, what I would like to see
from ROSEN is

619
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,000
and so connecting Base possibly yeah
everything what Joe already mentioned is

620
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,000
it's actually very exciting uh Base is
definitely there should be not difficult

621
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,000
to but will allow us to create a use USDC
trading pair for those who prefer USDC

622
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And then Midnight, if in 2026, I really
doubt that Midnight will be fully launched

623
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
by the end of 2026.

624
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
But anyway, we will keep an eye on that.

625
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Whenever Midnight becomes available,
obviously I would want us to have that

626
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
connection with Midnight as soon as
possible, because use is

627
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So it's a perfect fit for Midnight.

628
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Obviously, none of the centralized tokens
can live on the Midnight and preserve

629
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
privacy.

630
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Maybe they'll be able to go to Midnight
and just remain publicly available without

631
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
the, you know, shielded features.

632
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
fully traceable.

633
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
That's not what people who use Midnight
would normally want, but use can preserve

634
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
all the privacy there.

635
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So that's something I would expect us
also to accomplish in 2026 if Midnight

636
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
becomes available, right?

637
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
If they launch their network.

638
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
So this is kind of my, yeah, my plans and
expectations for 2026.

639
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I'm excited for 2026.

640
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
You know, Lethos has been kind of a
thought experiment for a couple of years,

641
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
which really hardens the assumptions
around proof of work potentially, which

642
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
makes the ecosystem a lot stronger from
the foundation.

643
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Rosen Bridge has always been this idea
that we should try to control our own

644
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
destiny when it comes to market access.

645
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I do think that one of the big
accomplishments I would like to see in

646
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
2026 is where our SDKs get built out
enough to where we actually start

647
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
integrating into wallets.

648
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I do think that rosen.tech as a website
will inevitably disappear for most people

649
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,000
to where perhaps it can be built into
applications via a widget or it can be

650
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,000
directly supported in some wallets.

651
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I do think that we can put together the
right framework to create incentives.

652
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
that encourage teams to do that.

653
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Ultimately, incentives will drive
outcomes there, so there's a potential to

654
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
add some small fee that then goes to the
wallet provider or the DApp provider, and

655
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
then it becomes more seamless, which
ultimately would be a pretty nice user

656
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
experience to build on.

657
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Yeah, that's actually quite a good
comment, Joe, and we, during the last two

658
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
years, we've been chasing these bigger
chains,

659
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
who are not very responsive and even
projects on these chains are not very

660
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
responsive to the opportunities that Rosen
provides.

661
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
But now all of a sudden we see that the
vectors change and actually the main

662
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
growth

663
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
may come from these smaller genuine
projects that we didn't think of let's say

664
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
two years ago, right?

665
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:39,000
But now all of a sudden, you know, when
everyone

666
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Everyone finds themselves in the same
trouble situation now.

667
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
They're looking for the solution and
apparently Rosen is one of the best

668
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
solutions available on the market.

669
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
So I'm very excited how it will develop
and I'm very excited if they will want to

670
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,000
extend their collaboration with Ergo not
only with Rosen but also with the

671
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,000
stablecoins that we have now.

672
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I've always thought that long term, it
makes more sense to move into smaller

673
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
ecosystems that are more understanding and
appreciative of what Rosen Bridge offers.

674
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
If you're talking about Ethereum, it's a
very, very crowded marketplace.

675
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
So your ability to get traction and
visibility is naturally hindered by the

676
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
amount of competitors, versus if you're
talking about smaller ecosystems that have

677
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
kind of encountered the same

678
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
difficulties or challenges that Ergo has
historically, there's going to be a much

679
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
greater understanding and appreciation for
what that tool offers.

680
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,000
And if we can connect enough smaller
chains, the collective power of that in

681
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,000
terms of visibility and user base and use,
I think will ultimately be better than

682
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,000
just trying to compete in a crowded
environment.

683
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Yeah, absolutely.

684
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Something we haven't touched while
waiting for Alex, something we haven't

685
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,000
touched, I can speak a little bit about
our block reward emission schedule.

686
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
This is something also very interesting
coming in 2026.

687
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
We have a block reward reduction in four
days from the time we are recording this

688
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
video.

689
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
So by the time it's released, I don't
know, maybe it will be less.

690
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,000
and then we have only one more block
reward reduction scheduled for April 2026

691
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,000
and after that we will settle at a very
comfortable from monetary point of view

692
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,000
0.85 I think per year

693
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
inflation rate, yearly inflation rate.

694
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
This is something what Bitcoin has right
now.

695
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Bitcoin is still very secure.

696
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:09,000
We don't know what will happen after one
or two more halvings that's coming.

697
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,000
But in Ergo, we will stay at that
inflation rate for I think like 14 years

698
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:21,000
or something like very long time, as well
as complemented by the demurrage.

699
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,000
So it's very exciting times because yeah
we've been

700
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Under this high inflation and lots of
miners, obviously, they need to pay for

701
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
electricity.

702
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
They've been selling on the markets and
the holders have been feeling that.

703
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,000
But now, in four days and in April,
finally, in April 2026, we're getting to

704
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,000
the point of very steady inflation curve
that should play

705
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
in favor of long-term holders.

706
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I don't want to speculate here, but
everything suggests that, yeah, we're

707
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,000
getting to that sweet spot that will last
for quite a long time.

708
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Yeah, and if miners are worried about
that, I would say in 2026, very, very,

709
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
very, very high likelihood that we see our
first token with the primary emission

710
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
being proof-of-work driven, which is going
to be Lethos, right?

711
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:27,000
And hopefully, we also explore this idea
of merged mine sidechains.

712
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And so then they have additional security
subsidies paying for their hardware.

713
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
It's coming online as kind of the Ergo
emission curve drops off, which will be

714
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
interesting because then it's a question
of, you kind of get to this multi-token

715
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
mining, I think probably like the

716
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Litecoin ecosystem is probably the most
developed with that where miners will get

717
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:02,000
paid in Litecoin and Dogecoin and a couple
other merged mined projects.

718
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So there is some, let's say new ideas
coming online for miners.

719
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Yeah, and actually I've forgotten, but
this is very important.

720
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
So usually in some proof of work,
cryptocurrency is the biggest event,

721
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
right?

722
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Because they don't have any others.

723
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Basically.

724
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
But yeah, here in Ergo, well, it's
basically a storm, right, of updates from

725
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
different projects and so on.

726
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
So I've started posting videos from
unstoppable, not unstoppable hackathon,

727
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,000
but stability workshop.

728
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:58,000
which was just after the hackathon, so
posted a use video, I believe, right?

729
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:04,000
But there are more videos to post, and we
are recording another video, and yeah,

730
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:10,000
well, announcements are coming from use
use, Basis Tracker, and so on, so on, so

731
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:16,000
on.

732
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:30,000
need to check what's going on with Gluon
USD, other projects, a lot of updates.

733
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Yeah, so somehow emission reduction is
not celebrated as in other communities,

734
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,000
maybe, unfortunately, because it's

735
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,000
It's very important, right, for the
underlying assets for its properties.

736
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,000
And yeah, well, it's changing a lot
outside.

737
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:00,000
It's changing a lot in the ecosystem and
beyond, right, also.

738
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
So yeah, it's important and it's quite
exciting to see finally, well, tail

739
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
emission coming.

740
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So let's see.

741
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Hardware.

742
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Yeah, so anything else that anybody would
like to kind of drop in terms of the 2026

743
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
ideas moving forward?

744
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
All right, so going back to the
beginning, so to better money, so there is

745
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
urgent need for better money.

746
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:43,000
So we now have another fiat currency.

747
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Collapsed again.

748
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:51,000
And again, actually, so it's Iranian rial
so.

749
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Back in 2019 it was.

750
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Like 100,000 rials per USD.

751
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Well, official rate was 40k, street rate
was 100k.

752
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So now it's 1.5 million.

753
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:23,000
So 15 times devaluation against USD,
which is also devaluating in six years.

754
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
So yeah, that's crazy.

755
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
And yeah, well, some protests started
already and that's not a unique situation,

756
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
right?

757
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:41,000
So that's happening like every week,
maybe even, right?

758
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:47,000
So every month at least in some country

759
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:54,000
around the world so yeah well fiat
currencies continue to fail they will

760
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:01,000
continue to fail and well in 2025 there is
a lot of disappointment seen about crypto

761
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:08,000
community that it is also failing to
deliver what was promised right when I

762
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:15,000
joined for example when

763
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:24,000
When I bought the idea of peer-to-peer
money without central bank

764
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:31,000
But it seems, yeah, well, here in Ergo,
we are standing on the very first

765
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:38,000
principles of the space and we are doing
progress.

766
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And it's actually quite exciting.

767
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:47,000
So there is an article by none else than
Joe Armeanio about, yeah, basically

768
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:54,000
taxonomy of monetary expansion

769
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
cryptocurrency on top of
cryptocurrencies.

770
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:04,000
So yeah, well, that's quite
groundbreaking, I believe.

771
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:18,000
So that's what I tried to outline for a
few years maybe as well, right?

772
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And well,

773
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Now it's, yeah, done by Joe.

774
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
So, and yeah, well, unfortunately, right?

775
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
So, well, people think that, you know,
this cryptocurrency space should be about

776
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
competition, like horse racing, right?

777
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,000
But yeah, I think, well, actually, there
is a lot of room for cooperation and it

778
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,000
would be good to see

779
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Well, understanding how to get to
peer-to-peer money, also useful for

780
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:04,000
real-worlds, not just toys for some.

781
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:11,000
nerds, right, doing some artificial
experiments, but well, money which may

782
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:17,000
have elastic supply, right, and fulfill
needs of digital as well as real world

783
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:23,000
economies.

784
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
For real, so yeah, it would be good to
connect to such people, but unfortunately

785
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I don't see, right?

786
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,000
So here in Ergo, we are in quite unique
position.

787
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And yeah, well, even more, somehow the
gap is even increasing.

788
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
So from my observations, so.

789
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:58,000
the crypto industry is getting more and
more hopeless in general.

790
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I think a lot of people are chasing
things based on asking the wrong

791
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
questions, just honest.

792
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:17,000
So I do think that we need to continue to
focus on kind of architecture and

793
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I don't know, control vectors in the
system, layers in the system, why they're

794
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
there, what they're for.

795
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And you're always going to have this
social layer in crypto that's chasing

796
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:34,000
attention and liquidity, artificial or
not.

797
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I don't think that's something that
directly we're going to out-compete with.

798
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
But I do think based on architecture, we
can build solid solutions that do stick

799
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
around, they do scale.

800
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:52,000
And ultimately if we answer hard
questions the right way, there's a lot of

801
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,000
value in that Right, so yeah, well
questions are wrong often right then we

802
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,000
have Well non-working solutions for
non-existing problems and Yeah, well

803
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,000
That's

804
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:23,000
That's quite a sad picture to see
actually when you see it year after year.

805
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
But here we are in quite a unique
position and I'm super optimistic so stay

806
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
tuned for Basis ChainCash.

807
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Most of

808
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Development done and that's also quite
exciting to see how development changed

809
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:50,000
well in 2025 mostly right so before I
didn't use AI-based coding and so on but

810
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:58,000
here most of the tracker so I did
contracts manually for sure

811
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,000
But then, yeah, off-chain part, the Basis
tracker, so it was AI-based coded, so I

812
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,000
didn't spend much time on it, just
reviewed everything manually, starting

813
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,000
from some point.

814
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:29,000
And that's also interesting, so it seems,
well, there is possibility now to make

815
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
great things without much developers
rights.

816
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Well, but there is need for clear
understanding among those developers what

817
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
they're doing.

818
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:48,000
And I think then, yeah, well, asking
right questions again, helping a lot.

819
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:56,000
So yeah, well, in regards with
technologies in general,

820
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
AI and so on.

821
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
So, yeah, well, things are changing
rapidly.

822
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
It's hard to understand.

823
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:12,000
There was quite a famous tweet from
Andrej Karpathy a few days ago that even

824
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:21,000
he, one of the biggest minds in the AI
field, doesn't understand, well,

825
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:28,000
clearly what is development about these
days, because it's like old tooling plus

826
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:35,000
new tooling, and this new tooling is
changing like every month basically.

827
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:47,000
And not just evolutionary, but yeah, a
whole new concept sometime appearing.

828
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
out of thin air.

829
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
So yeah, it's very challenging and
rapidly changing environment, right,
