00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello, and welcome to the new setup of
the Ergo Community Chat.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We started a little early this morning
than our normal 1700 time just because I

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
wanted to get through the dev updates and
then maybe have people join slowly and

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
chat there and go from there.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I managed to snag HQ. HQ, good morning.
How are you doing?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Good evening from me.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What time is it there, sir?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's six o'clock, six p.m. Oh, that's
nothing.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You were talking like it was like two
a.m., man.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah, you thought I was Joe, or Joe's
alt, right? And you thought I would just

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
show the people that I am.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
One of Joe's 30 alts, right?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Nice, nice. All right, so let's dive
right into, well, let me start off with

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
something else. Let me start off with
something else that I put in the chat the

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
other day, right? And you might have some
good words on this, too.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So everybody hopefully at this point
knows that the Ergo Foundation main goal

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
was to bootstrap the community, right?
Essentially get things propped up, get

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
things going, prime the pump, and
hopefully the community is up to speed and

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
available enough to continue the ecosystem
going.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And we're kind of at that point right
now. We're kind of at that crossroads.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Now, that doesn't mean the EF will go
away. The EF could continue to sign

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
exchange listings as that entity. It could
continue to maybe try to get grants for

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
their treasury, perhaps support
development, support research, any of that

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
type of thing. The EF, as far as I know,
is not vanishing.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The point is, we have a couple
outstanding things that are at the prime

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and are needed for the community to take
over. And some of those things I listed in

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the Sigma Not Chat the other day were,
one, market making. That bill is about

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
$10,000 or $12,000 every quarter, I
believe. It's not a small bill, right? And

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
that bill is never going away if we want a
market maker.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And a lot of other chains will utilize
market makers that trade against their

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
community and saying that they'll run the
market maker so that they make a profit

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
off the spreads, right? So that when you
guys, the community, trade against it on

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
other chains, potentially you are putting
money into whoever's running that's

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
pocket, splitting by the market maker and
by the people that hired the market maker.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So Ergo has never done that, ever. That
was a whole stipulation for the market

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
makers that we get. We also have market
makers that are friendly in the US, which

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
can't do that kind of thing. So our market
makers currently do not make profits off

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
our trades, off our supporting the spreads
and debts. And that's painful, right? So

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
it's about $12,000 every three months to
the market maker to support that.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Now, there are some community members
that have come forward that are willing to

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
give it a try with their bots and with the
liquidity that we already have there. So

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
that is something that we're going to be
testing over the next month or two. We're

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
going to have some people perhaps give
that a try, see how that goes, utilize our

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
market maker for advice and tips on what
to do, what we're doing wrong, and that

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
kind of thing.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And then take market making into the
hands of the community, which is kind of

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
scary and cool at the same time. Some of
our community members have already been

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
running some market making on other
exchanges. So it's not like they're just

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
going to take this from scratch. They have
experience with this. So nothing to be

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
worried about there. But that's one of the
things.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The other things we've spoken about quite
a bit are the main explorers, right? So

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
there are some pretty beefy machines
running in Hetzner right now that cost, in

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
total, the Hetzner bill is about 760, it's
about 680 euro, whatever that is, in

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
freedom dollars, 720 freedom dollars per
month. And that's not an easy cost to

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
swallow either.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So in the Infra P2P DAO, it's running.
And it can take probably 99% of all

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
queries, simply. But it can't do these
massive queries that take machines with

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
about 120 gigs of RAM. HQ and AQL have
been sending some test queries for me to

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
check out over the past month or so. The
main explorers can hit, but not the

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
smaller P2P machines.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So the solution around that, just to keep
you guys informed, is to run the beefy

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
explorer that I have here with me. And I
have another machine that will ship to

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Jamai. And Jamai will run the other one
for now. So essentially, we'll continue

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
the use of the main Ergo platform, the
Explorer. We'll redirect to those. We'll

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
encourage everybody to use a P2P nodes,
except for large queries. And we'll go

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
from there and see how that works.

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hopefully, maybe we'll get older machines
with a lot of RAM that we can also add to

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
that. Maybe at some point, something like
a Sigma, what is it called? Sigma Explorer

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
HQ?

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
SigmaSpace.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Thank you, SigmaSpace, which is built for
fast returns on large queries. But it

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
takes a decent amount of hardware to run
it. So maybe those will be integrated as

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
well in there. But the main important
thing is the big bottleneck on what we see

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
is Cloudflare with these kind of things,
right?

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So the idea is that we publish the main
Explorer link. We publish the P2P DNS

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
URLs, which are load balanced in many
machines. But also, we encourage

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
developers to go to our list of individual
machines, which we'll parse out for the

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
P2P, and we'll also have the two machines
from the main Ergo Explorer, so that if

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Cloudflare goes down, your app
automatically rolls over and uses a

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
straight-on DNS or even IP address of one
of the Explorers.

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Or, hey, if you're a developer, why not
host your own Explorer? Write HQ.

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah, it's actually it's not hard. There
are a couple of Explorer built on nodes.

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You can dockerize them and run them for
you. You just need maybe a user index

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
node. If you don't have, you can use any
exposed index node and run your own

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Explorer. So yeah.

87
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Exactly. And there's even the P2P
infrared dial put up. We put up a GitHub

88
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
that should get you going really quickly,
too. Just change a couple of parameters

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
and spin up the Docker, and then wait for
the node in the Explorer database to sync.

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So it's there, ready for you. And don't be
shy from it, right?

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Meanwhile, you're checking that I would
like to add some comments to that. Why do

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
we have the market making and why do we
need it? So the sad part of the crypto

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
industry is that you're required to have
those services if you want to maintain or

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
sustain your tokens on any exchanges.

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So that it's not that we really want to
run those bots or we really want to trade.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
is that if you want to be part of the
ecosystem in which the crypto has become,

97
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
you need to have those things and you need
to have your trading and volumes and all

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
that. So it is understandable that people
run those and EF running those and

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
sustaining those and on no profit. It's a
good thing.

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So if we plan to not use them in future,
we will be required to have a basic

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
minimum volumes on any exchanges. So
that's why there is going to be a

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
community members who are going to run
these things for the community. So there

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
are no more delisting or any things like
that in the future.

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Right, exactly. It's if you want to be on
the exchange, you got to play the game,

105
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
you got to pay the piper, essentially.
Yep, so it's unfortunately the way the

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
ecosystem is right now, right? The
industry, I guess you could say, but it

107
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
sucks. But hey, why list tokens and
exchange coins and blockchains on merit

108
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
alone when you can literally extract as
much value as you can from them via

109
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
trading?

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah, I think that's a sad part of
crypto, right? All the exchanges which are

111
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
centralized. So if we go on more
decentralized exchanges, if Rosen gets

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
more attention, then we won't be needing
that. So if there are more users using

113
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Rosen and they are using the DEX on any of
the connected chains, then you actually

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
don't need, if you have enough volume and
enough trades with your wrapped assets,

115
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
you don't really need the access to
exchanges.

116
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So yeah, it's a path which we are on and
we have to just keep our heads straight

117
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and go towards that. And that's, I think,
the only path we have. Seeing all the

118
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
scams and everything and exploits
happening in the exchange and all the

119
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
shenanigans they do. So I think the best
part is to go that pathway.

120
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I agree. And then additionally, on top of
that, at some point, hopefully that

121
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hummingbot community repo will come out
with Ergo integration with DEXes. Is that

122
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
the Rosen team that was working on that or
still kind of slow burning that?

123
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I think it was Rosen plus Splash.

124
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So just Rosen.

125
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I need to check. Yeah.

126
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah. So hopefully that comes out at some
point. And then community. I mean, even if

127
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
we're talking like you have a few hundred
ERG kicking around with something like

128
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Hummingbot, multiply that by a couple
hundred users running these themselves,

129
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
just like Watchers, that'd be amazing.

130
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What would be cool, too, HQ, is if Rosen
found a way to integrate Hummingbot into

131
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
their watcher protocol so that running a
watcher also means arbitraging and market

132
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
making via Hummingbot. That'd be neat, but
you can't do that because you have to have

133
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
separate accounts and everything and it
gets messy. But yeah, that'd be neat, but

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
cool.

135
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Well, another thing they can use is
VaultPay, right? Which has no KYC and you

136
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
can do all the swaps there also. That is
also creating volume. So if you don't want

137
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
to check, if you don't want to touch any
exchanges or don't want to KYC, you just

138
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
swap your assets through any provider and
you are just creating the volume there on

139
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
those exchanges. So you're not touching
the exchange.

140
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No, we don't want to go there. Is it on
your main page?

141
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:06,000
VaultPay.store.

142
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:14,000
There we go. All right, so you buy
straight up, right? Gift cards.

143
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah. So for example, if you're going to
make a trade on, let's say, BTC to ERG. So

144
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
you just select, I'm changing BTC for ERG.
And it will give you like, there are four

145
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
providers who will give you this and that
and that. You choose the provider in the

146
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
back end. What is happening is you are
sending your BTC or BTC to the provider,

147
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
which is exchanging those on exchanges.

148
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I like that you're actually showing the
swap providers here as opposed to not

149
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
knowing which ones it's going through. I
actually use this right here. This worked

150
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
well. Swapping from crypto to a prepaid
card, they email you the card, you type it

151
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
in, you go to the site, you can use a your
bogus email address or your private email

152
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
address. It doesn't matter at that point.
And then you can pay services like

153
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Lighthouse Storage that we use for ACO and
HQs and auction houses.

154
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
IPFS, of course, yeah. Yeah, IPFS kind of
stuff. So prepaid cards was really well.

155
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It was really

156
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I was worried that... We are in
Christmas, right? You have also gift

157
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
cards. If you want to gift someone gift
cards, you can buy them also with Ergo.

158
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
With Ergo. That's awesome. So what are
you using? So VaultPay is your, this is

159
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
your code right here, but what are you
hooking up to and integrating with?

160
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm working with Trocador, which is
actually known in the community from

161
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
around six to seven years in all the
crypto industry. So they have a very good

162
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
reputation. And then we use a swapper,
exotics, and multiple providers in a

163
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
backend, which basically do the swapping
for you.

164
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So if I want to, there's no, there's KYC
when you buy with currency though,

165
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
correct? Was that the deal? I think it
blocks me in the US, I think, or in New

166
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
York state. If you're buying with crypto,
no? No, if you're buying with cash, I mean

167
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
with credit card.

168
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
There is no option to buy with credit
card. If you're getting a prepaid card and

169
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
you are not allowed, there are several
countries which are not allowed to get a

170
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
prepaid card, because they won't work
there. But the USA one is working. So you

171
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
are basically getting a swipe card. And
you can use that anywhere.

172
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah. Awesome. Cool. Let's go back. Let's
put this up while we're chatting some

173
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
more. Why don't you talk quickly, before
we go to the Dev Update, since you did it

174
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
this week, why don't you talk about what
you did last week for your use

175
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
integration?

176
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Well, I was getting sick of seeing people
asking the question about when use. So I

177
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
was like, OK, let's fix this. So we
integrated the native pools of use and

178
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Dexy Gold in MewDex. So you can now swap
inside the DEX, and you can also provide

179
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
liquidity. And on the other end, there are
two functions in the protocol, which is

180
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
freemint and arbmint. So basically, when
there is a price difference, you can free

181
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
mint it so it can level the price between
the LP and the bank.

182
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So if you go to bank.MewFinance.com, you
will be able to see that on you. If you

183
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
select use, it will give you that. This is
the LP price and this is a bank price and

184
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
it will give you recommend you what is
best for you. So you will be able to

185
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
directly swap on bank to interact with the
DEX LP and also to buy in the bank. So

186
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
it's all in the same widget. You will be
able to do that.

187
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Very cool. And you got this out before.
We're still waiting for the other

188
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
interface, right?

189
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No, I think they have. Yeah, but they
don't let you augment or they don't let

190
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
you do all those. It shows that it can be
augmented, but you cannot mint those

191
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
tokens from those UIs. Yeah.

192
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Awesome. Awesome. Hey, CannonQ, welcome.
Is CannonQ here with us? Can you hear us?

193
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah, can you hear me?

194
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
We can. Welcome. Good morning, sir. How
are you doing?

195
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Hey, doing all right.

196
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Nice, nice. We're looking at use
stablecoins right now with a new

197
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
MewFinance integration of it. Super cool.

198
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
All right, guys, let's jump to the
developer date really quickly. We'll bang

199
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
through that, and then we'll start
chatting some more after that.

200
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Great. Let's see. I'll go quickly through
here. We've got Game of Prompts finishing

201
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
up the interface in the contract, likely
have it completed before the end of the

202
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
year. The Wallet UI library received for
two or three PRs implementing ErgoPay.

203
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Banner received more than 50 PRs. Great.
Some of them focused on searching for

204
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
potential bugs in the contract. All right,
so this is Joe Sameh with Game of Prompts.

205
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
kushti was part of an Unstoppable
Hackathon and Stability Workshop,

206
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
presented chain cache paper for Stability
Workshop to help Unstoppable Hackathon

207
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
teams with mentorship, design, and code
reviews. Was that the thing where he was

208
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
just in India just recently? Yeah, cool,
very cool. He's traveling right now, which

209
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
is why we don't see him.

210
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
kushti is continuing to test chain cache
basis. Krux by Louis Vatra. Let me turn

211
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
off this so you can actually see names.
There we go. Louis Vatra, Krux added DEX

212
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
LP swapping, extract SOC to NFT on token
from Ergotry constants and fee from swap

213
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Ergotry constants. So should support all
instances using the same template.

214
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Who is this guy you know, autogenitor?
Right? Yeah. Working on Ergo Power,

215
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Launcher Script Power Optimizer, Control
Script. You guys know what this is? You

216
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
guys paying attention to this HQ?

217
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
If you want to read it and read the
complete smart contract, I would be glad.

218
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Because I think they just copied and
pasted the chat GPT, and that's it.

219
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Oh, this is that. OK. I got you. What is
this thing they're working on?

220
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Actually, I didn't read it because I saw
the chat GPT. Would you like to modify

221
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
this somehow? And I was like, OK, so
that's like.

222
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, interesting. OK.
All right. We'll come back to that maybe.

223
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Lethos release version 2.2.0. That's
cheese. Cheese enthusiast. Upgraded sync

224
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
process to be multi-threaded. Rollups NISP
trees. NISP trees. Say that fast five

225
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
times. Now sync individually. Change
logging for sync process. Most APIs

226
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
listing data objects are now sorted by
height of the mine block as they're

227
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
associated with fixed LDB errors related
to multiple database instances. So Lethos

228
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
is still going strong.

229
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Degen's world. If you guys haven't played
around with this, it's a lot of fun. It's

230
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
pretty darn neat. Launched two new mini
dApps, token board, letter board style

231
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
view for native tokens, and ergo trace. Is
this what I think it is? Let's see. Do we

232
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
have an address? I don't get it.

233
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Ergo trace is one of the best things I
have seen are OK built.

234
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me see if I can
get an address, which, yeah, I don't want

235
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,000
to use that one. Do I have an address
here? One second. We can do this. Let's

236
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
just get that.

237
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I was just telling him to just maybe use
heights and balances on different Block

238
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
height so imagine that if user had Two
thousand ERG at one point you check at

239
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
that one how much he had that that from
that till next from to Block height it

240
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
will give you that he sent this here. He
sent that to exchange He sold this much.

241
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
He has this much yesterday in that night,
right?

242
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That would be such a nice tool to have
all right Let's see what happens for

243
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
everybody to see I may have grabbed too
big of an address. Yeah, I think I got a

244
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
huge address. We're crashing it.

245
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah. Just grab the Spectrum LP pool one.
And I think that will burn your computer

246
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
too.

247
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
All these addresses are big. Yeah, but
you guys check this out. It's a very nice

248
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
3D representation of the blockchain
showing some really cool animations back

249
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and forth. Maybe we'll, yeah, it's too big
of an address. Let me see.

250
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
OK, we'll take tipper bot address and see
that go. And I really want people to see

251
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
this. I haven't seen it yet. OK, we'll let
that run. Yeah, there we go. So you can

252
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
see the Explorer here. Pretty neat.
Everything connected to it. So this is my

253
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
tipper bot wallet that is a very neat
token node transaction. How come you

254
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
didn't build this, HQ?

255
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I have this already built for me.

256
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Also, Glasgow has a version of this. He
has set up for tracing these kind of

257
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
things, which is neat, too. It's on
GitHub. But this is definitely the

258
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
prettiest that I've seen it happen. Yeah,
cool.

259
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
All right, what else do we have? We have
token boards and letter board. He's got

260
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Zirgon working on encrypting local
database persistence for PONW scores. PONW

261
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
scores plans to test GPU-based models
while mining to determine impact to

262
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
latency and mining performance. Man. Rob's
really cranking it out.

263
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Added local files or created several
files for use with local LLM models, doing

264
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
some vibe code testing with context, added
contract audit examples. Ultimately, there

265
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
should be a list of optimizations within
ErgoScript that can use this as context

266
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
for a starting point. Nice, nice, sir.

267
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
What else do we have? Chris has updated a
lot of language things in Nautilus,

268
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Aircraft Explorer, WalletApp, SigmaUSD.
Always thank you to Chris for adding those

269
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
things to things like CoinGecko. Whenever
you see all those socials added, I think

270
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
he just added a bunch to that, which is
great. Thank you, Chris. Is this a thing?

271
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Nope, that's just a discussion.

272
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And we have Louis Vatra working
ErgoScript, LSP, POC, Vibe. Oh, Louis Vibe

273
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
coding now? We're in trouble. A lot of
trouble.

274
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
How do you think that you got the swap
model on Crux?

275
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Oh, he vibrated. Well, I guess if it
makes him go faster, right? As opposed to

276
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
the usual two-part theory.

277
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yeah, the thing is that he knows which
cells to touch and which cells not to

278
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
touch.

279
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
True, true. Yeah, very true, very true.
All right. Where were we here? We'll leave

280
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
that up for a second. All right. Anything
else you're working on, HQ?

281
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
No, I would like to just shout out to
Michael because he's doing some nice PRs

282
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and he's learning how to be a dev.

283
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Oh, what's he PRing on? What's he doing?

284
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
He's doing stuff on crux. He added top
trading. He is working on front end now.

285
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
He's working on APIs. So yeah, I just want
him to see that how painful it can be

286
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
sometimes.

287
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That's awesome. That's fantastic. Yeah,
great.

288
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So what else I have been building? I
think I, I started working on a wallet.

289
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Wait, what kind of like your own wallet?
It's, it's best.

290
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Yeah.

291
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Not like a, not like a, not like a frosty
wallet HQ. Remember the frosty wallet?

292
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah, I remember that one. No, it is, it
is like a dApp. It's a dApp, but which

293
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
acts like wallet. So you can create an
wallet. You can send transactions through

294
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
it. You can send money to send tokens to
others. And it will have the integration

295
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
of all the mew apps in it. So for example,
you have love in your wallet. So you go

296
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and click on your balance and you will see
all the options under it. So you will see

297
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
swap, lock, burn. So you will be able to
interact with all of those through that

298
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
wallet and you won't be signing them
through anything because you are using

299
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
already fleet. So you can import your
wallet directly into the browser and use

300
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
it. It will have password protection and
everything. So yeah, I think you saw some

301
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
screenshot I shared in the MUFI dev chat.

302
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yes, perhaps. When's that going to come
out?

303
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I don't plan to release anything for now.
I think I have released a lot. And I want

304
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
to see some adoption to those things
first, because I'm just burning myself

305
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
here.

306
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
That's true. You're making a lot of
stuff, so I got you. We got a comment in

307
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
the chat that says, we love the new
on-ramp for Nautilus. We need more of

308
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
that. And for people who haven't seen
that, you can see there is the Buy ERG

309
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
button right there in Nautilus, which
takes you to Banksa. Which they're going

310
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
to yell at me because I'm in New York and
we can't do anything fun in New York ever.

311
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So yeah, but that's nice. So the good
news is too that what's it called stealth

312
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
swap saw this and we're like, hey, we'd
like a button there too. So we're talking

313
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
to see how deep that integration is and
what they want to do with it, if they want

314
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
to do it themselves or if they're asking
for money for that. But I think that'd be

315
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
neat at least to have another button here.
So buy or swap. And then why isn't Vault

316
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Pay in here?

317
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I think because it is I think I will make
a PR, yeah.

318
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Yeah, make a PR. So the question is, is
Stealth Exchange same as Stealth, whatever

319
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
did you just say?

320
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Stealth X. Stealth X, yeah.

321
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I do. I do. VaultPay uses them as one of
the providers.

322
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Oh, amazing. So just put VaultPay in
there. We don't have to put Stealth in

323
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
there. Yeah. All right, make a PR right
now. Don't forget, sir.

324
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I think Anand won't like it because it's
backed by centralized stuff. So the

325
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
providers are centralized, so he won't
like it.

326
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And BankX isn't? Banksa isn't? I bet this
is very centralized.

327
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Yes, it is not centralized. It is like
military protocol. They ask you for how

328
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
many moles do you have on your left leg
and then your right leg also.

329
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Oh, gosh damn it. I got you. I think I
know someone who even had to send them the

330
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
photos of their kids to just tell them
that they are their kids.

331
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Oh boy, what's the world coming to? I
think if we're going to stay in this

332
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
industry and if you want something
decentralized, Bankside is not the thing

333
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
to get into.

334
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
What's that, CannonQ?

335
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
The big issue or the reason why we pushed
for Banksa was there was a common refrain

336
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
in Ergo that there was no U.S. access. And
other than you in New York, you now have

337
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
U.S. access. And people are now
complaining there's a 10% fee. Well, do

338
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
you want to access or not? Everyone knew
that was the fee ahead of time. Perhaps

339
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
that wasn't explicitly stated, but if
you've ever used any of these or looked at

340
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
them, you knew it was going to be a 10%
take rate, which is less than any of you

341
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
guys in the US that are using FanDuel or
any of the other crappy betting apps.

342
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
They're taking more than 10% from you, so
shut up and buy your ERG or don't.

343
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
From the man himself, CannonQ, that's
your advice. Shut up and buy your damn

344
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
ERG. Oh boy.

345
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I think we have a quarter of the day.
Shut up and buy your own.

346
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
That's perfect. I'll make an NFT of that
one. Perfect.

347
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Oh, what's going on here? I got a fake
Joe writing me. Awesome. Great. So

348
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
speaking of that, let me, and I know
people want to hear more about probably

349
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
like, ERG price go up and that kind of
thing. But I'd like to just give the

350
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
audience right now, and at least a
recording of what we're integrating here

351
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
at Cornell to empower and make better
function of tools that we already have.

352
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So there are a couple of ways that we're
integrating our token into the thing,

353
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
we're trying to create somewhat of an
economy for the token. So that means you

354
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
have to have a distribution method, so
ways that people can get a hold of the

355
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
token, and then ways that people can
utilize the token, right? Because if you

356
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
just dump a token on people, what are they
going to do with it, right?

357
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So we've got a couple onramps and several
offramps now for this token. The onramps

358
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
are essentially, if you bring in plotting
paper to recycle, and we have a lot of

359
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
kids coming in probably right now while
I'm in my office and ignoring everybody,

360
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Recycling paper, we give them some of the
token. And then also you faculty members

361
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
would be able to give students tokens,
staff members give students tokens for

362
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
other things as well.

363
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
There's also another method that if you
follow our shop safety protocols and you

364
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
properly swipe in your badge, then I run a
script every once in a while and it takes

365
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
your check-in and it automatically sends
you some brick, some token. So that's our

366
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
on-ramp to the students, how we currently
distribute it to students.

367
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Now, for the off-ramp, we have a couple
of different methods. You can pay for

368
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
plots. And let me find that thing right
here. You can submit a plot at the plot

369
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
center right here. I filled in the info
already to make it quick. I've told my lab

370
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
model not to touch this darn test. And
I've chosen blockchain as a payment. So

371
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
when I hit Submit Print Job,

372
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And this is what I was talking about the
other week where I'm very grateful to

373
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Louis Vatra for the tip bot so that we can
really make an ease of kind of what's it

374
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
called? Easy introduction to students who
are using this. And I think I've waited

375
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
too long on my page and it's died. Anyway,
so that's three. Oh, there we go. Perfect.

376
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So that's been submitted. It says
blockchain payment required. And if we

377
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
look, let's go to here. We can see that in
my blockchain payments channel, it's given

378
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
me all the information with my NetID and
everything.

379
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
All I have to do is copy that. paste it
in, and now I've successfully tipped that

380
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
brick to the system. And in the back end,
all we're waiting for is, let's see, we're

381
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
waiting for it to pop up here after it's
confirmed in the blockchain. So that's one

382
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
way that students can spend their brick at
AAP on the blockchain.

383
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
The other ways are for staff. We have
appreciation portals where we can send

384
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
brick to people. And those appreciation
points, the brick can either be passed on

385
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
to other people. See if we can have a nice
built-in connection wallet here. Or we can

386
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
go to swap brick. And we can actually
trade those brick for real Amazon

387
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
dollar-to-dollar appreciation points. So
you can see if I connect my wallet and I

388
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
put I want to pop in 100 brick to trade
right there, we'll get $12 of appreciation

389
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
points. So that's a way for people to, if
they want to exit the system, can off-ramp

390
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
into real dollars as far as that goes.

391
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And then, of course, we have a large
system for the students as well. You can

392
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
see we have a lot of recycling done in the
top here that we've been giving out brick

393
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
for students, massive amount of
information of how to set it up. The

394
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
students can then go also and submit their
brick to a 3D printer swap, which means

395
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
that at the end of every month, when
they're ready to be built for the filament

396
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
that they use in a 3D printing lab,

397
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
our owner of the 3D Print Lab will go
into this system and will upload an export

398
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
from the 3D Print system. And this system
automatically parses it, combines it with

399
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
the brick that was sent from that student,
and removes that price from the student's

400
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
bill. So if a student was going to be
billed for $50 worth of filament for 3D

401
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
printing, and they submitted $20 worth of
brick that month,

402
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
then they're only going to be billed for
$30 worth of filament. So it's a really

403
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
cool way for kids to be able to take their
brick also and spend it there. And since,

404
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
of course, we're not asking students to
buy any ERG at all for that, at least now,

405
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I have my admin top up, essentially, that
checks all of the balances of the wallets.

406
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And if there are wallets with less than a
few transaction fee amounts in it, I just

407
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
hit the build transaction and boom, and it
sends them all enough to do that.

408
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You'll see this in about five seconds
here when we go through that. So the

409
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
reason I'm showing you this, guys, is
because I hope some people that are

410
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
watching this or watching in the future,
that are very speculatively oriented, that

411
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
are like just into crypto for, let's get
some speculative assets. Let's make 200%.

412
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Let's, so see, we found six wallets with
less than three ERG. We go down, we can

413
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
see which wallets have less than that.
There we go. So all we have to do is

414
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
connect Nautilus and send the proper
amount of ERG.

415
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And we have sent it. I just got the
tipper bot message. So now these guys are

416
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
going to be funded with enough for
transaction fees that they can go forward

417
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
with. So back to that. So I'm hoping that
I can show you guys that there's no screen

418
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
share. Oh, yeah. There's no screen share
on this zone. Sorry, CannonQ and HQ. Just

419
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
going to have to trust what I'm saying. Go
to YouTube and check it out, CannonQ and

420
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
HQ.

421
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So the idea I'm trying to promote here is
that I hope, at least Ergo's mission has

422
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
always been to try to drive innovation and
try to drive use case scenarios with real

423
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
electronic money, right? That's in your
hands. And this is essentially what we're

424
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
trying to do here. We're trying to make a
system that we can give value to the

425
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
students, right? Give value back to the
students, and then not have control of

426
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
that value once it's in their hands,
right?

427
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Now saying we can technically stop
students from, yeah, when tuition payments

428
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
and brick-nice We can stop the exit
points, right, of brick being spent here

429
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
at AAP if we want to, but that doesn't
stop their possession of their token and

430
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
what they can do. A student could take my
GitHub and pull the stuff off of it and

431
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
make a swap for themselves kind of thing.

432
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Like where is it? Like this site right
here. This is the same thing. We have it

433
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
up for students. They can come and they
can swap brick right here. We could hit

434
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
that and it would bring up our Nautilus
wallet and ask us for the 1,200 brick, all

435
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
built in right here. So it's kind of like
what HQ built for physicals. And we can

436
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
see a student's already posted their Steam
Deck for US dollars, actually, not brick,

437
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
because nobody quite has this much brick
yet after the first semester and a half of

438
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
this. But kids are using it, and it's
pretty darn neat.

439
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Let's see if this is. Transaction hasn't
cleared yet, so we don't have our plot

440
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
here quite yet. But yeah, so the idea is,
If I can reach anybody out here that is

441
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
just into crypto for speculation, it's a
little deeper than that. That burns fast,

442
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
that burns hot, that goes out fast, right?
This kind of stuff is really what we could

443
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
use it for. Giving value back and power
back into the hands of the people who,

444
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
should have it, right? The decision makers
or the non-decision makers or everybody's

445
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
a decision maker. If you wanna be blunt
with that.

446
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Yeah, so that's it. Sorry CannonQ and HQ
that you couldn't see my screen share.

447
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
One thing is, which I would like to
clarify, is that there are people who

448
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
think that crypto and blockchain are the
same thing. Right. So crypto is one thing

449
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
and blockchain is another. So there are
thousands of things you can do on

450
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
blockchain which are not crypto related.
You can build anything on a blockchain.

451
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You can use the blockchain as a database,
as a validator, as a verifier, as an

452
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
amplifier or whatever you want to.

453
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So you have to just get the thing that
the dollar value is something you have to

454
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
get out of your mind. So one ERG is going
to be one ERG. And every time I say this,

455
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
people will be like, yeah, but it is 0.47
right now. I was like, that's a dollar

456
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
price kid. You can do so many transactions
with one ERG. Just imagine 0.004, that's

457
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
the minimum box value you need. So imagine
how many boxes you can build with one ERG

458
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
and imagine how many data you can put in
one register or one box. So that's the

459
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
power of blockchain and that's what Ergo
offers.

460
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
The things built on top of Ergo are what
gives it Another perspective, it's the

461
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
DeFi, it's the DeFi on Ergo you can find.
But the main core of Ergo, the one thing

462
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
which made me love Ergo was the blockchain
and not the price or not the crypto aspect

463
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
of it.

464
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And I think we'll get there eventually. I
mean, it's definitely a long haul, that's

465
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
for sure. But I think we'll get there. I
think we'll get more and more people

466
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
weeded out that are just here for the
gambling and for the chains that will

467
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
offer that to them. And we'll filter
through that and we'll get people that

468
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
stick around and actually want to see
utility and want to build it and use the

469
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
blockchain for what it's meant to be used
for.

470
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah, I don't I don't blame those people
because that's what is crypto sold as far

471
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
as to get is to get rich and people will
do whatever they can do to get rich.

472
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
People scam people will do frauds. People
will do anything to get rich. So that's a

473
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
sad part of crypto.

474
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Yeah, I agree. I agree. Let's see how my
block is doing. Has it confirmed yet? Can

475
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
you speed up the chain? HQ, it's still
unconfirmed. We got a long block when it's

476
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
live. That's how it always works, right?

477
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Dude, I hate it when I do a long chain.
Every time I have to test something in a

478
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
smart contract, then I will Another good
point thing, which I didn't say, is that

479
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
you can now use socket on MewTech. So what
does mean that if you transfer some ERG or

480
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
anything to another address and you
connect it right instantly, you will be

481
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
able to see that you have that. So you
will be able to create stuff when they are

482
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
not even confirmed.

483
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So you're using chain transactions up
there.

484
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Yeah. So the swaps will be much faster
now. The only thing which always happens

485
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
on the DEX is a slippage. So if there are
many people trading in the same LP, so

486
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
just have that in mind that there will be
some stock order because that's how the

487
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
protocol works. Just change the slippage
and try to try again. That's it.

488
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah, and for people that don't know,
too, that are watching this now or later,

489
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
the Nautilus also has this feature. If we
go to Settings right here, you can turn on

490
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
zero conf which is exactly what it sounds.
So if I'm sending something from one

491
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
wallet to another wallet, or somebody sent
me something, I can see it in my wallet as

492
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
soon as it hits the mempool, just like HQ
was talking about. And then I can send it

493
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
out while it's still in the mempool, it'll
do a chain transaction. So that's a really

494
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
neat feature that's part of Nautilus now
as well, down here in experimental, that

495
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
works really well.

496
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I've never had trouble with it with Ergo
and normal sending transactions. It's not

497
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
like other chains that start with an E
where you send a transaction and, oh, I

498
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
got to add 20 more bucks to it to pop it
through. That doesn't really happen on

499
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Ergo. So chain transactions are very
successful in that manner. Do you use this

500
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
feature? Do you have this turned on in
your Nautilus HQ?

501
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah, by default.

502
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Nice. Wait, I don't think it's on default
now.

503
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Well, for me, it is for you. For you,
yes, yes, yes. Yeah, but last I checked

504
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
with it, and it was something, it was not,
it was just in testing phase. It was not

505
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
kind of like polished.

506
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Yeah, I don't think so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,
nice.

507
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Let's see, what time is it? 12.26? Well,
we've been going for an hour, but people

508
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
may have just joined us 30 minutes ago.
What else we have to talk about? Let me

509
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
see if there's any hooligans in chat or
questions. No.

510
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I think we might do we might do Ergo
Santa. So what we are looking for are some

511
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
contributors who would like to drop tokens
to the two part. So so we're planning to

512
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
do a DEX campaign where we will. We will
say that trade this that or that in those

513
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
pairs and that at the end we will be
dropping the. No, first we are getting we

514
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
are collecting all the funds to do the
airdrop to all the people who contributed

515
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
in the campaign. So we already have one
million FAKU from CannonQ. Okay, I will

516
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
add another one million FAKU from me.

517
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
You guys are FAKU.

518
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Well, now you're a FAKU whale. You should
be doing more than a million. I'm just a

519
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
minnow here.

520
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Okay, I will do two million then. Okay.
You do one million, I do two million, my

521
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
friend. Okay.

522
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
That's like a thousand dollars coming out
right there.

523
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Wow. What else? I think we have Disco
Solaris is also providing some PHP also.

524
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And what else? We will see if there are
someone who wants to contribute. So please

525
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
just go to the MewFinance Telegram and
just look for me and I will provide you

526
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
address and you just drop those there. And
at the end of the event, we just

527
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
distribute all those tokens depending on
the contribution the people did on the DEX

528
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
campaigns.

529
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Oh, nice. I think I have some FAKU LP,
only like a couple hundred bucks. But I

530
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
might be able to pull that and put that
in, because there seems to be a ton of

531
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
FAKU LP already in there. I don't think
it'll hurt it much. I think there's like

532
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
six grand LP in FAKU right now. Let's
look.

533
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Eight grand, I think. Yeah.

534
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Last I checked, it was eight. Yeah.

535
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Well, we got a price dump. So yeah,
around 5.5 or 6.

536
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You got a price dump on FAKU?

537
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah. Not on FAKU, but on ERG. So
basically for ERG price drops, then also

538
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,000
price LP drops. Yeah. Yeah. So that's why
we launched Mew paired meme coins, which

539
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
were runes from Bitcoin. So they don't
suffer that much. And to have more

540
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,000
activity on the block, on the DEX also,
because people are, people are more

541
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
emotionally attached with their ERGs and
not that much with the Mew.

542
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Yeah. What did you do with the Mew? Did
you vault that Mew that I sent you, HQ?

543
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I think I locked it and I unlocked it.
And now I think those 15K Mew will be

544
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
distributed to all the top in the
leaderboard for the runes and DEX

545
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
campaigns we created. So yeah, we have to
just I'm just spreading them. I have too

546
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
much mu to get.

547
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Good. Good. Spread the mu. Spread the
joy. Yeah. Let's see. Oh, look at that.

548
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,000
The block confirmed. Fantastic. Let's see
if it's... There we go. Perfect. So now

549
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
that the block is cleared, the plot shows
up in the back-end lab monitors, and they

550
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
can actually send it out to a plot. Pretty
neat.

551
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And another trick for you is you just go
to live.ergoexplorer.com and you can see

552
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
when the block confirms. So it will show
you the in-comings of TXs and then when

553
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
the block is confirmed, it just goes away
and then your transactions start coming

554
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
in. So that's one way you can see.

555
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,000
This is Echo? Yeah. You didn't build this
for Echo?

556
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
No, I just gave him the emotional
support.

557
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Nice. All right. Let's see. We've got any
last questions here. Oh, yeah. Graeme

558
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
wants to ask about Ergo Santa. Is that
going to go? Is that not going to go?

559
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Yeah. Graeme can send all his shitcoins
to us and we will distribute them all to

560
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
all the contributors.

561
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Do you have a live page of the bank? You
should have a live page of the bank.

562
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I think it is. Yeah, it is
ErgoCentra.MewFinance.com. It is live and

563
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
it is updated and you can already send
messages to Ergo Santa. You can write your

564
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
letters.

565
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,000
What is it? Ergo Santa? Yeah.
.MewFinance? .com.

566
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It doesn't like it. Just say try center.
No, it should be

567
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
ErgoCentra.MewFinance.com. Throw it in
chat if you're on desktop.

568
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
No, I'm on mobile. I'm not on desktop.
The last time I touched desktop was two

569
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
months ago.

570
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Is it on here? Is that on your main site?
Yeah, if you go to the MewFinance.com,

571
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
there it is.

572
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It's santa.MewFinance.com, sir. You have
too many URLs you don't even know.

573
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Yeah. No, you said ErgoSanta. Don't
listen to me. OK. So do we have

574
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
contributors? So no, what I was talking
about is you should have a list of, I

575
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
mean, I guess we can go to this wallet and
see exactly what's in there, right?

576
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Yeah. If that is a contribution wallet,
yeah, you can see whatever is in it.

577
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
All right, everybody, let's see if
there's anything in there yet.

578
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Just be aware of the Anaconda, please.

579
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Of the what?

580
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
BBC, I think.

581
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Oh, don't worry. I won't do the visual.
Yeah, we got some MewGarang. Is that real

582
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,000
auction house token? I don't know. It's
some clown. 3D collection NFT from Comet,

583
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Cat with Bat. Oh, look at that. You've got
some evotes from Frosty.

584
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Damn it.

585
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Those things are never going away.

586
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Now people will call us scammers now. Got
some quacks, some ERG god. Okay. I will

587
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
add, I will add five NFTs of proof of work
girls thingy that.

588
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Oh, perfect. Yeah. Yeah. That was a good
one. Yep. I will add, I will add five of

589
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
those also. Okay, I will add 10 of those,
okay.

590
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Maybe I'll throw in a few Greasy Hex NFTs
from season one or two, but I don't know.

591
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I don't know if I can. I love those
things. If I have a double, I'll throw

592
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
some of those in.

593
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Okay, what else can I drop? Let me think.

594
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Do I have my NFT wallet hooked up here?
Let me see. Hang on.

595
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Okay, I think I can drop some Blitz cards
too, because I'm not seeing any future to

596
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
those.

597
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I don't think I have my NFT holder. Yeah,
I do. Here we go. Let's see. Yeah, yeah,

598
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,000
yeah. Something like Rollerblader number
four, Rollerblader three. I can't give

599
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,000
those away. Maybe I'll donate this one. I
paid a lot of money for this one. You guys

600
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,000
remember this one?

601
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I think we can't see it.

602
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Oh, you can't see it. Sorry. It's the
ErgoBass NFT.

603
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Oh, damn it.

604
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
You want that HQ?

605
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:48,000
No, thank you. That dance is very smelly
right now. It's been two years, I think.

606
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
That's very smelly. Yes, yes. Yeah, all
right. So it looks like you got a good

607
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
start. You got some neta in there, 710
neta. You got 20 padilla. You've got some

608
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
kushtis. You've got some suns. You do have
a lot of BBC in there. Woof.

609
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
We have blun.MewFinance.com now.

610
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
There's a million FAKU coming. It's
inbound now.

611
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Oh, sweet. Let's see if he's telling the
truth.

612
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Of course I am.

613
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Yeah, just go to live.ERG. There you go,
folks. You can see it on screen. CannonQ

614
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
just donated a million FAKU to the Ergo
Santa. Hot damn.

615
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,000
340 bucks, by the way. Merry Christmas or
whatever you guys celebrate.

616
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
All right, everybody. You know what is
the fun part of all this? CannonQ, how

617
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
much was it? Three ERG or five ERG? Two.
Two ERG. I was just talking to someone the

618
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
other day. I was like, dude, if we really
want to be on top of the charts on any TVL

619
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
or any volume, this takes us maybe 30 to
50 minutes to release something and pump

620
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
it because it is so simple.

621
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I know. It just shows you how bullshitty
it is.

622
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Look, if I go and lock all the Mew I
have, let's say in the Mew smart contract

623
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,000
for the tiers, So that will boost and give
me another maybe one million into the TVL.

624
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And that puts us in maybe in a second in
all the proof of work chains on DeFiLlama.

625
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
It's just, it's just stupid metrics. I
would say.

626
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Yeah, I know. It's like, it's literally
like, I feel like these kinds of things,

627
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
like central exchanges, when they do this
kind of bull crap and other projects that

628
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
fake this kind of stuff. I feel like you
ever go to Like an amusement park or a

629
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
winery and they have a pond and they have
these carp, there's like a billion carp

630
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
that are like tripping over each other. I
feel like it's sad. It's like just so

631
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
easy. It's just like, here's some
breadcrumbs and there comes a billion

632
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,000
fricking carp to it. It's like, it's just
so asinine. Now you've ruined my day HQ.

633
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I think you are married. You don't have
any days in here.

634
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
That's true. Speaking of that, I got to
go pick up my dog and bring him back home

635
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
and then get back to work. So I think we
will chop chop this thing. Sound good?

636
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Sound good, boys?

637
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Yeah. Have a nice day, guys. I'm going to
cut some veggies and make some shawarma.

638
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
All right, guys. Definitely. Everybody
contribute to Ergo Santa. It'll be fun.

639
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
You'll get something back. Hey, real
quick. Are you guys splitting that up this

640
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
time? So if there were, I don't know, 200
keys, you're just taking whatever the

641
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
token value is dividing by 200 or somebody
getting.

642
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
No, I think, I think we're just, we're
not sending any keys this time. It will be

643
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
a DEX campaign. So we will be set up, set
up multiple DEX campaign based on tokens.

644
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
So for example, if we have a lot of FAKU,
so we can create a campaign on FAKU. So

645
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
you have to trade in this liquidity pair.
And as this is one of the rewards, you

646
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
will gain more on top of that.

647
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I'm just asking because it says get
airdrop. That's what I'm just trying to,

648
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
you know.

649
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Yeah, because you will get the airdrop.
So if you contribute in a DEX campaign,

650
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,000
you will be part of it. It doesn't matter
if you do a single ERG or multiple ERG or

651
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,000
whatever you do. It will be depending on
your contributions, which you do, but you

652
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,000
will get a drop. Maybe you get some gold
or who knows whatever you will get.

653
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
All right, boys. Sounds like a plan.
Thanks, everybody, for joining. And next

654
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
week is another break. So it's Christmas
here in the US. I guess in the world, too,

655
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,000
right? It's not a US-exclusive holiday.
Oh, please help me. In which world do you

656
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
live? Dude, I live in no sleep and
building and all that kind of stuff. So

657
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
yeah, I know. Tell me about it.

658
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And then after that, maybe we'll do,
what's it called? A dev update. I'm going

659
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
to try to record a video with Joe at some
point. If I can talk him into it, maybe

660
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
we'll just pop on late at night and drink
and do it. Those are always fun. But other

661
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,000
than that, yeah, CannonQ just mentioned in
chat, please listen to the, it's right

662
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
here. Let me show you. It is the chat that
he just did, kushti just did with a, now

663
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
it's too far down. Goodness gracious.

664
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
What's the name of it, you guys remember?
Here we go, right here. Bitcoin Takeover,

665
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,000
full episode right there on YouTube. You
can go through it right here, right there.

666
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Super neat. Really good talk between
kushti and this guy. It doesn't say, does

667
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,000
it, what its name is?

668
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Yeah. It's Vlad Kostya.

669
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I think you're right, Vlad. So guys, go
listen to that. It's really short. It's

670
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
three hours and 21 minutes.

671
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Half of it's the hotel kicking kushti off
the Wi-Fi.

672
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Well, I think I listened to an hour and a
half of it, and then I had to hop in the

673
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,000
car, so I didn't finish it up. But from
what I heard of the hour and a half, it's

674
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,000
pretty good. Some good insights from
kushti. Some good dig in there. So

675
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,000
everybody, enjoy yourselves. If I don't
see you before the holidays, have a great

676
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,000
holiday, and we'll see you on the flip
side of the new year. Thanks, everybody.
