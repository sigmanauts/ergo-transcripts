1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, welcome everybody.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Happy Ergoversary.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm here with Alex and we wanted to
discuss kind of the state of the state and

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
some potential ideas moving forward that
we think are pretty interesting for the

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
community, for miners and I guess for the
world in general.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You know, we've said, many of you have
heard Alex say for, I don't know, a couple

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
of years that the world needs better
money, it needs better collateral, and

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
we're kind of still stuck in this cycle of
spiraling debt that's growing

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
exponentially across the globe.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Inflation is always rampant in certain
areas and that declines kind of the

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
economic purchasing power of people across
the world.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And you also have this vector of economic
freedom and freedom from surveillance is

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
becoming more of a let's say history
rather than a bright future.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So definitely there are issues that
hopefully we can create tools to address

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
kind of the economic freedom and
prosperity of humans around the world.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's what open money is about and you
know Ergo is kind of this open source

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
project that explores these ideas and
tries to implement solutions so Alex how

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
are you doing?

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Doing well, doing well so yeah well,
complex and quite a bit to have so

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
actually a lot of quite positive
developments right, like well recognition

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
of the need of well digital stable coins
right even in centralized form then yeah

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
well digital gold is going into different
reserves but yeah I mean it's also done

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
not very properly usually right so I mean
a lot of positive motivation maybe in some

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
positive moments but

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Also, yeah, well, a lot of things done
quite properly, so yeah, there is a lot of

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
work.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Ideas can be wonderful, but execution is
always the hard part, right?

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Right, yeah, exactly.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Proper execution where, you know, the
devil's in the details and you understand

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
the trade-offs that you're, let's say,
building into.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So I've heard a bit about this idea of
better money.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I wanted to have you introduce that to
the community and kind of share your

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
thoughts on, let's say, this idea of
ChainCash and building better money for

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
the world.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What does that look like to you?

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Right so actually a lot of ideas right
which can be found in different forms on

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
the forum and

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah, saw some white papers and now there
is ongoing effort on getting Ergo book

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
done.

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So yeah, well, what do we have now is
kind of good base money, so proof of work

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
assets, right, such as

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Ergo Bitcoin Monero then yeah some assets
which

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It can be good and also widely used such
as real-world assets rights.

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The biggest one is USDT, which is, well,
tokenized

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
treasury basically, right, of some
private company.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Tether company, yeah, so the reserves are
made of different financial tools, right.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So it's actually the biggest RWA.

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But yeah, well, people are trying to
tokenize also commodities,

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
real estate and whatever rights to build
then financial tools on top of rights in

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
case of USDC and other centralized stable
coins, tokenized private treasuries.

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So, yeah, it's quite more
straightforward, right?

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So we already see a lot of so-called DeFi
tooling, right?

53
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Well, which is not maybe so decentralized
if it's based on some private entities,

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
right?

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Reserves based on trust to the same
entity.

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But anyway.

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah, I would say that that does tend to
be a really interesting thing that we're

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
seeing in the space is like, as this idea
of onboarding real world assets kind of

59
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
increases, we're seeing a really broad
spectrum of like, reserve assumptions,

60
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
right?

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You know, maybe, maybe updated once a
month, you know, we're still kind of in

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
like this paper accounting world that kind
of digital

63
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Money has this ability to disrupt, but
then you also have kind of, let's say,

64
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
less, let's say, clear assumptions around
certain reserves where you can't directly

65
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
or independently verify them.

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Some of them haven't been audited.

67
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's somewhat of a mixed bag in the
space, if you ask me.

68
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Right, so then, yeah, well, among us,
right, so some, well, core Sigmanauts.

69
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, many efforts done for formalizing
trust issues, for example, and then build

70
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
better tools such as ChainCash, which is
basically a foundation for digital free

71
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
banking, blockchain-based.

72
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
also and yeah building also well
trustless derivatives algorithmic stable

73
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,000
coins and more right so well Bruno for
example presented a lot of schemes and

74
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
continuing to do that

75
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So then there are high-level schemes to
ensure, for example, risks of non-delivery

76
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
of physical commodities, right, with
algorithmic stable coins and so on.

77
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So yeah, well, a lot of theoretical
schemes.

78
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And now I think there is need to push for
practical adoption.

79
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's why we are starting a better money
initiative to push all those things for

80
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
the real world.

81
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So we are already connected with
different entities such as pro-private

82
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
companies,

83
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:45,000
well entities like some well African

84
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:54,000
nations interested already experimenting
with tokenization and having need for

85
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:03,000
things like project funding for small
cooperatives and so on.

86
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So yeah, actually a lot of demand for
better funding

87
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
around many areas around the globe,
better funding, better money rights, then,

88
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
yeah, well, in case of, for example, a
site cooperatives producing something,

89
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
there is a big question.

90
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Well, how to sell, right?

91
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And how to buy.

92
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So,

93
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There is need for better kinds of money
for international trading and so on.

94
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
A lot of requests, right?

95
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So yeah, well, it is still shaping how
well it will be done in regards with

96
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
structuring, funding and so on.

97
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But yeah, nevertheless, so all the
principles are set and the mission I think

98
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
is more or less clear.

99
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah, I would agree.

100
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Building kind of open source frameworks
that don't, let's say, capture people as

101
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
much as traditional finance has a tendency
to.

102
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Right.

103
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So yeah, well, there are areas where you
simply don't have a traditional finance,

104
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
right?

105
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And also Lebanon, for example, two years
ago when I visited it and I am pretty

106
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
sure, well, since back then, the situation
is not better, maybe worse.

107
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Right.

108
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And then, yeah, many places in Africa,
Latin America, and so on.

109
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And yeah, well, a lot of places with
hyperinflation and high interest rates and

110
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
so on.

111
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So, yeah, well, big demand, right, for
better monetary solutions, funding

112
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
solutions and so on.

113
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So beyond that,

114
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
How are we looking with sub-blocks and
kind of your latest work?

115
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What are you working on these days?

116
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So, just doing final sync for 6.0 to
propose it to miners.

117
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So, at the moment of releasing this
video, probably, well, the miners probably

118
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:56,000
would update nodes already and set voting
configuration in the setting files.

119
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Then, yes, sub-blocks, which actually
another.

120
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, a point of interest rights in
regards with.

121
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
better money.

122
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So it's also about high-performance proof
of work protocols, right?

123
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And better proof of work protocols.

124
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
There are a lot of hot discussions these
days about proof of useful work.

125
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And then, yeah, well, high-performance
proof of work protocols because, yeah,

126
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
since

127
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The Merge, Ethereum Merge, it's quite
clear that Proof-of-Work protocols are no

128
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
worse at least than Proof-of-Stake in
regards with efficiency, right?

129
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So there was a myth that Proof-of-Stake
is more performant for some reason.

130
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
which was debunked before the merge.

131
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I think that's largely ignored, so now
it's quite clear that proof-of-work

132
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
protocols are actually more efficient,
right, because less overhead for

133
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
agreements.

134
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Basically every miner is working on its
own.

135
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,000
There is no communication needed for
consensus except for propagating new

136
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:41,000
blocks found with already valid solution
in most cases if it's not a forked block.

137
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And yeah, even if it's forked, then many
protocols is accounting for such blocks

138
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
somehow.

139
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But anyway, so it's totally asynchronous
and most performance kind of consensus.

140
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And then there are different approaches,
right?

141
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
How to achieve concrete efficiency.

142
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
not just asymptotic, how it gets more
even spread on peer-to-peer layer among

143
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
the blocks.

144
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And here we have sub-blocks in Ergo,
right?

145
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And well, there are similar proposals in
other blockchains, for example, Tailstorm

146
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and Bitcoin Cash, but yeah, well,

147
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's not quite clear when it will be
deployed.

148
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:54,000
We still have privilege to deploy things.

149
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:04,000
without, you know, spending years on like
resolving some debates in the community.

150
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But yeah, well, this time is limited, by
the way, so with growth of community, we

151
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
will get to the same states.

152
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Obviously, so yeah, it's better to do
well all the

153
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Things like that now, but, yeah, I mean,
they also non-controversial.

154
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I mean, in, in comparison with, well,
other options.

155
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So it's, it's kind of, pretty, soft kind
of soft fork, right?

156
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah.

157
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
In, in regards with activation, it seems
to be.

158
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So, but anyway, so yeah, well, after 6.0
and

159
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Sub-blocks, let's see what would be next
upgrades for the core protocol.

160
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I think it would be dependent on, well,
sidechains implementations and so on.

161
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And probably, yeah, would be about, well,
maybe taking the best ideas from

162
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
experiments done there, right, and also
start putting

163
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Sidechain, but also, well, it's not
crystal clear at the moment, right?

164
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What could that be about?

165
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yeah, let's see.

166
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But hopefully, it will be about, well,
pretty soft forks anyway, right?

167
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So gradual updates without breaking
applications, without splitting community

168
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and so on.

169
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah, the backwards compatibility is
quite important.

170
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah, so on every hard fork, it's quite

171
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
ordinary to lose some part of community.

172
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So when I used to be NXT co-developers,
so yeah, well, basically the community

173
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:37,000
disappeared after a few hard forks pushed
by the main JLP.

174
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And well, a few forks cost quite

175
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
quite brutal even disagreements in the
community and so splits.

176
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Right.

177
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And yeah, even in Bitcoin, right, without
any hard forks.

178
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So that's a block size civil war actually
cost some forks to appear such as Bitcoin

179
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Cash and more.

180
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So like, yeah, a few new kinds of Bitcoin
appeared.

181
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And yeah, we can expect more because here
now they have talks about demurrage and

182
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
things like that, right?

183
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So we may expect maybe some more forks.

184
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That kind of leads into the Sigma Chains
idea.

185
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
In terms of the Bitcoin protocol itself,
one of the more interesting ideas floating

186
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
around, in my opinion, has always been
drive chains.

187
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It seems like the most practical way to
increase the miner revenue of the protocol

188
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,000
from side chain activity.

189
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
kind of really reduce their let's say
economic reliance on the block subsidies

190
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
without needing to touch.

191
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You know, let's say demurrage or the CAP
or, you know, some of the other more

192
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
controversial proposals for extending the
security model.

193
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And, you know, I guess potentially open
up some avenue for innovation and

194
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
expansion on top of the protocol, which
right now

195
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You know, you have all of these different
Bitcoin layers and you have some You know,

196
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I guess more or less interesting designs
in terms of like You know trustless relays

197
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
on top of Bitcoin or you have something
like Rosen but kind of this idea of Let's

198
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
say merge mined drive chains.

199
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I've always thought was the most
practical like long-term path to

200
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I don't know.

201
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Let's say sustainability and security for
Bitcoin itself.

202
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And, you know, merged mining is, you
know, pretty interesting to watch.

203
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You know, we see that in the ASIC world
on script miners with Litecoin, Dogecoin.

204
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
We're starting to see that show up in
kind of the CPU space with Monero and then

205
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
different merge mined projects that are
kind of

206
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Creating additional revenue streams on
top of that security and so I do think

207
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
that there's a big benefit to pulling that
into the GPU space and potentially

208
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
hardening Ergo long term and opening up
the same potential path for sustainability

209
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
of security and

210
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
innovation and also some interesting
trustless interoperability that actually

211
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
does, I would say is probably the cleanest
way to get chains to communicate.

212
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's just a more complicated method than
what we see around.

213
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
What are your thoughts on that general
idea or direction?

214
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So, yeah, I think, well, merge mined
sidechains could provide, well,

215
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
significant revenue boost, right, for
miners.

216
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Well, it is especially clearly seen in
Litecoin, right, so when I visited some

217
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,000
conferences so I witnessed some ASICs
advertisements promoting some script ASICs

218
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:58,000
as Dogecoin and Litecoin, right?

219
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So the Dogecoin put in the first place
but it's merge mined sidechain of Litecoin

220
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
just so

221
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah, Litecoin is number two, right?

222
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The main chain.

223
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And yeah, well, the sidechain is number
one.

224
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So it's not so clear in Bitcoin, but
yeah, there are a lot of merge mined

225
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
sidechains.

226
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Maybe not so many, right?

227
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But there are a few more or less.

228
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
thriving well with their own communities,
even in the ecosystems, merge mined

229
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
sidechains.

230
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And recently, yeah, well, some started to
appear around Monero, done by Tari Labs,

231
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and well, there is upcoming

232
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
merge mined sidechain with private
contracts, which is dark DeFi, right?

233
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And so, yeah, I think it's time to work
on such things for Ergo, right?

234
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
To provide, well, additional income for
miners and also to, well, create more

235
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
liquidity,

236
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Right, and also to play with new ideas
without touching the main chain, which is

237
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
quite stable.

238
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I think, well, it's actually

239
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:53,000
stable for good rights and still there is
a lot of unlocked potential right there in

240
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:01,000
the Ergo and its contractual layer and
block structure and so on.

241
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And well, there is some unlocked
potential in regards with

242
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
sidechains also, especially I mentioned
my sidechains.

243
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So as shown in my submission for ErgoHack
8, there is possibility to have trustless

244
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
two-way peg, right?

245
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Just using some contracts on Ergo and
some actually quite small additions to the

246
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And then, yeah, we can actually do very
different and interesting things there.

247
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So what I'm thinking about is to create
some double merge mined sidechain.

248
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So Bitcoin and Ergo merge mined, right?

249
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Kind of ordering blocks, right, to be
written on the Bitcoin blockchain and

250
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
input blocks on the Ergo blockchain.

251
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Right, and then... Yeah, so with double
commitments on both

252
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Blockchains, there is also possibility to
somewhat DeFi for Bitcoin with quite

253
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:43,000
trustless transfers.

254
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Well, with minimum trust assumptions.

255
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Then, yeah, well, those ideas of drive
chain, so BIP 300301.

256
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:05,000
would be helpful but so yeah we can go
without them even so I mean that they

257
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,000
would be helpful for a better peg for
Bitcoin but here we can have also we can

258
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:21,000
adopt some

259
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Well, techniques, others already working
on and then reusing Ergo applications and

260
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
also having trustless peg with Ergo
blockchain, right.

261
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And then there could be different ideas
tried also.

262
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So there are also other vectors which can
be tried.

263
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So, for example, we may have some
privacy-oriented

264
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I mentioned my sidechains, right?

265
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So recently, well, I started to dig into
Zephyr, which is a jet protocol done on

266
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:16,000
top of some fork of Monero.

267
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But yeah, it seems, well, you can do
better, right?

268
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So you can have

269
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Merge mined sidechain with a variety of
stablecoin protocol, even with one

270
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
stablecoin protocol somehow.

271
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
But you need to limit it somehow with
better oracles because in case of Zephyr

272
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
it seems it's just centralized oracle and
here you can do oracle pools.

273
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
But then you may have private transfers,
right?

274
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Just using

275
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Well, ErgoMixer or adding also private
amounts, right, so using more complicated

276
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
cryptography, even FCMP from the upcoming
Monero updates for full chain membership

277
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
proofs and so on.

278
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So, you can do a dark DeFi based
sidechain, right?

279
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:26,000
So, have private contracts for ERGs,
right?

280
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Possibility, right, to move transparent
ERGs to the side chain, right, and then

281
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
use them in dark contracts.

282
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So yeah, well, possibilities are quite

283
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yeah, it opens up a lot of space for
developers to play and underneath the

284
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
network, it creates new increased revenue
for miners potentially, which is always

285
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
good for the security of a proof of work
network, right?

286
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Yeah, for Ergo miners, but then, yeah,
well, it could be interesting to Bitcoin

287
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
miners as well, right, if it's about
double-merge mined sidechain.

288
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
There could be more options, for example,
making a merge mined sidechain of Ergo,

289
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
which is also a partner chain of Cardano.

290
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Two kinds of blocks validated by Ergo
miners as well as Cardano validators.

291
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And also with the goal of trustless
interoperability.

292
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And in case of Cardano, it would be even
simpler to make it closer to, well, be

293
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
fully trustless.

294
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah, I think there's a lot of, let's
say, green areas there to explore.

295
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I think that putting together some base
tooling and some EIPs around, let's say,

296
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
the implementation of merged mining opens
up a lot of green space for quite a while,

297
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
which would be great to see.

298
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Right.

299
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Then, yeah, there is the idea of
dedicated sigma chains, right?

300
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Well, it's about not much merge mined
chains, but chains with dedicated proof of

301
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
work.

302
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,000
With the idea to tame different classes
of hardware and so on, right?

303
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Which also does make sense because, well,
currently there is a lot of untamed

304
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
computing power, I believe, right, in the
form of ASICs.

305
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Even if you go on to like WhatToMine, you
know, there are constantly new

306
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Chains that I don't know what they offer,
but there people like to spec mine stuff

307
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
that pops up So there's obviously hardware
demand sitting around there.

308
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
That's you know Somewhere to park and
hopefully be profitable in the long term,

309
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
which is always its own challenge and
proof of work I guess but I Definitely

310
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
think the capacity is growing.

311
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So the demand is there if there's kind of
the economic

312
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Let's say a utility for directing that
computing capacity somewhere.

313
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I do think proof of work is great at
absorbing excess capacity.

314
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
That's kind of its superpower, I guess.

315
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So, yeah, a lot of untamed computing
power.

316
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Yeah, in ASICs and GPUs, right?

317
00:31:51,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And there will be more GPUs soon to be
outdated, now used for AI.

318
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But then, yeah, well, there is need to
tame the power.

319
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:14,000
CPUs, some classes of CPUs probably not
so well.

320
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
suitable for Monero mining concern so
yeah well a lot of possibilities here and

321
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:28,000
well yeah instead of launching some new
blockchain like another fork of Bitcoin

322
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,000
with some well features which are not
needed

323
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:46,000
What people also doing some fork of fork
of Kaspa, right?

324
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It was quite popular like one year ago to
to launch some forks of forks of Kaspa.

325
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And so on.

326
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So yeah, it's it would be better to
launch some.

327
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Well.

328
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Ergo similar sigma chain, right, with the
idea to

329
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
get rails with Ergo, and then Rosen
Bridge since day one, so liquidity with

330
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
all the chains, liquidity pools on
Ethereum, Ergo, Binance Smart Chain,

331
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Cardano, and so on.

332
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And then also applications.

333
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Right.

334
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And then, yeah, you can do some
experiments you want to do, well, in

335
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
addition to a new kind of consensus, like
taming new hardware.

336
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Yeah, you can also do something on the
application layer.

337
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And yeah, so I think Merge Mined
Sidechains is a low-hanging fruit, right?

338
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And well, from them, it will be quite
clear how to extend

339
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
The contractual layer in easiest way to
introduce new features new contracts and

340
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
so on Yeah, right.

341
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Maybe new Sigma protocols such as Yeah,
yeah now have Some generalized Sigma

342
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:35,000
protocols Suitable for a much more
powerful things But yeah, maybe not so

343
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
maybe not so efficient as what we have in
Ergo.

344
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I mean, they have, but they're doing much
more also.

345
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So, yeah, I mean, for concrete
applications, it would be good to provide

346
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:59,000
ways for developers to play with new
features and to

347
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
to open possibilities right to experiment
in those areas now are inaccessible rights

348
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
with other blockchains.

349
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So well, you cannot easily play with
applications of

350
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Some newer sigma protocols, for example,
by using EVM, right?

351
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:35,000
But yeah, here in sigma contractual
layer, it's more or less straightforward.

352
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Yeah, I do think that that long term
opens up a lot of, I don't know, green

353
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
area.

354
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You know, I'm excited.

355
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I think that's

356
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
more or less the point of building kind
of these open source contractual layers,

357
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
open source applications.

358
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You know, some, I don't know, you watch
like a sci-fi movie, right?

359
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You always see people kind of interacting
with money on different devices having

360
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
different energy inputs, different
consensus models that are all

361
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
more or less interoperable, right?

362
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And so, you know, to do that on top of
clear security stacks is really

363
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
fascinating to consider long term.

364
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Right, right, right.

365
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So yeah, and it would be also quite
eco-friendly, right, to utilize outdated

366
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,000
hardware for producing, well, money,
basically, producing commodities, right?

367
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It's, I think, much better than, for
example,

368
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I don't know, wasting huge pieces of land
to extract gold and other metals, other

369
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
commodities.

370
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Then we have a lot of tooling on upper
levels such as

371
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:16,000
ChainCash rights and other tools in
addition to just non-DeFi tooling which is

372
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:24,000
also there right like traditional DeFi
tooling such as

373
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:37,000
liquidity pools, LPs and auctions,
lending pools, bonds and so on.

374
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So what do we have on Ergo?

375
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Well, valuable, right?

376
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So just imagine if you can run some Merge
Mined sidechain, right, with shared

377
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
liquidity, with the main ErgoChain since
day one, with Rosen Bridge, and yeah, with

378
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
some new features developers would like to
experiment with, and yeah, with all those

379
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,000
applications, so.

380
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Yeah, and with liquidity being created
naturally, right?

381
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
From block to block.

382
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Gradually unlocked, so it's not about
launching, I don't know, memes or well,

383
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:39,000
rugpull tokens, where owners of the token
can dump.

384
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
making price going down like minus 90% in
one hour, like happened recently a few

385
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
times with different VC rugpulls.

386
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So yeah, well, it's a much more natural
story, right?

387
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And also beneficial to Ergo miners and to
the Ergo ecosystem because of more

388
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:14,000
liquidity rights going here and there to
side chain or back to the main chain.

389
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So, yeah, well.

390
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Quite exciting.

391
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yeah, I think you know more or less clear
path towards that future, which is

392
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:33,000
exciting, you know, sometimes in the I
Don't know the cryptocurrency space.

393
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I think that like narratives consume
reality, but they are sometimes not even

394
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
based in reality and having like a

395
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,000
clear engineering path towards like I
guess how to put this together and what

396
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,000
the benefits are pretty more or less like
clear and straightforward which is always

397
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
a little bit more useful than kind of the
narratives that sometimes we hear around

398
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
you know this ability to build like an
open source

399
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
financial operating system or application
stack and then make it portable across

400
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
let's say different chains or value inputs
and that can all trustlessly talk to each

401
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
other is a powerful goal long term I
think.

402
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Especially if it's more, I don't know,
clear from like pre-centralization, which

403
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,000
is what we're seeing more and more and
more in the space in my opinion.

404
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Instead of like decentralization, things
are kind of come to market pre-centralized

405
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
and then are supposed to go through some
path where power is distributed.

406
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
You know, oftentimes they either
oligarchies form or, you know, that

407
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
initial people just leave and then do it
again, right?

408
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Yup, yup.

409
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Yeah, that's how meme coin clans are
working, right?

410
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Often it's about a few people.

411
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:27,000
They're launching meme coins one by one
and promoting this nonsense, right?

412
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
New meme coins, then rugpull, then yeah.

413
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And another guy from the clan is starting
another rugpull.

414
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Narrative consumed to reality is what I
call it, rather than having a clear

415
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
foundation for a better reality.

416
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Yeah, at the same time, I see a huge
request for a fair distribution right

417
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
after all those rugpulls.

418
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Yeah, well, I don't know, maybe it's my
bubble, but yeah, my crypto Twitter is

419
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
full of that.

420
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Yeah, mine too, but I think we're in the
same bubble.

421
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But I do think, if people take narrative
and then they repeat it until it tries to

422
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
become reality and then it's not reality,
I think after enough rounds of

423
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
experiencing that, it kind of disillusions
people.

424
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Right, but yeah, I think there is trends
indeed, right?

425
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:37,000
So yeah, well, when people observe those
nasty rugpulls and yeah, it's not

426
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:45,000
something unknown, right?

427
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,000
So the whole space works.

428
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And then there is a quite natural demand
for fair distribution, right?

429
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And then, yeah, I mean, the problem of
fair distribution was solved back in 2009,

430
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
right?

431
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And it's proof of work.

432
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Yeah, no, I completely agree.

433
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Actually, this problem

434
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
This problem existed before Bitcoin,
right?

435
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:30,000
With first digital cash schemes, like one
done by Hal Finny, so it used proof of

436
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,000
work, but didn't have difficulty.

437
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And then, yeah, well,

438
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Hal used some trusted hardware, but yeah,
without difficulty still, yeah, so well,

439
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
the distribution was in hands of, I don't
know, the developers able to optimize

440
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,000
their miners basically, right?

441
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I forgot the name, it was RPOW or
something like that, HashCash.

442
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Yeah, so some pre-Bitcoin digital proof
of work based currency, but without the

443
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Bitcoin emission schedule and difficulty
recalculation rights, also the much needed

444
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
part.

445
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
of the equation.

446
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So yeah, and then the problem was solved,
right, among others by Satoshi.

447
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And then people somehow lost it again.

448
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And now having all those things.

449
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I think there's just a desire to
replicate the success of Bitcoin, but

450
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
personally maximize profit potential from
it.

451
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Call it what it is.

452
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Yeah, but yeah, I think actually, well,
the ethos of Bitcoin is quite forgotten.

453
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So people are just launching digital
tokens to grab some value from bigger

454
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
fools basically.

455
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
No, Bitcoin is taking on a life of its
own these days, but I still think that

456
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
like the initial, I don't know, roots of
having like fair distribution of money and

457
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
permissionless non-KYC anonymous or pseudo
anonymous ability to participate in like a

458
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
global network is still just as powerful
as it was.

459
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It's just, yeah.

460
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Somewhat different let's just say that
Um, yeah, yeah is what it is All right, so

461
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Yeah, so I think this is direction which
we are discussing for some time, right?

462
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Probably for about one year.

463
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Yeah, one or two years we've been talking
about this on the side.

464
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Now it's the time to jump on
implementations and motivate people to

465
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
implement.

466
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
All those things.

467
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
But anyway, I think that's kind of the
natural progression for most things that

468
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
we've seen on Ergo is they've been an idea
that's talked about, discussed, debated,

469
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
refined for like a year offline, and then
we finally get the bandwidth or like time

470
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
energy resources to do something in that
direction.

471
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So I think that's somewhat natural.

472
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Yeah, but also, well, crystallization of
ideas takes time.

473
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Yeah.

474
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Yeah.

475
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So, yeah, then it's quite natural, right?

476
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So, yeah, first there are discussions for
many months and then, yeah, well, some

477
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
action.

478
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:07,000
This is how it's going with sub-blocks,
right?

479
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:15,000
So it's been discussed since 2023,
something like that.

480
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
But yeah, implementation is ongoing now.

481
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And yeah, it's quite good.

482
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So I think to the moment of releasing
this video, there will be updated DevNet.

483
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And yeah, well, in somewhat July, we can
think about injecting sub-block supporting

484
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,000
nodes into the public testnet.

485
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Let's see.

486
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Let's see.

487
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Hopefully everybody out there that's
tuning in can throw some mining power

488
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
towards the public testnet when we get
there.

489
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Yeah, it's just one of those things.

490
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:04,000
We sit and we try to build and we watch
the global debt increase at its own curve

491
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,000
and inflation pop its head all across the
globe and kind of this increasing march

492
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
towards less economic freedom, more
economic surveillance.

493
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I would say that sometimes the systems
that I see pop up in the quote-unquote

494
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,000
cryptocurrency space actually support the
increase of debt and the absorption of

495
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
inflation and don't necessarily enhance
freedom.

496
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Maybe they enhance user experience, but
on the surveillance side, it's a little

497
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
sketchy.

498
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Hopefully, long term, we can build better
money with better assumptions.

499
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
that contributes to a better world.

500
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:54,000
That's kind of the net goal, yeah?

501
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
All right.

502
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So, yeah, stay tuned.

503
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
A lot of news coming.

504
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
All right, everybody.

505
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Happy Ergoversary.

506
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Happy Ergoversary.
