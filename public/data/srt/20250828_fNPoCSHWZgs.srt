1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
There it is.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Welcome everybody to the Ergo official
AMA, right?

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So you're only seeing me today because I
think it's a sign of the evolution of

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Ergo, right?

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So I am here to announce today that AMAs
in the future are going, for the time

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
being, moving to full-on community
peer-to-peer AMAs, right?

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So that means that all community are
involved, all communities sit at the

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
table, and all community can have a chance
to chat with legends like kushti, like

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Joe, like Dan, all once a week on Thursday
mornings.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So I think that's good news. And I think
that's particularly the path that Ergo

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
should take and is taking, right?

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We're moving everything off EF servers
with the InfraDAO. Why not take AMAs and

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
move them off the official propped up EF
channel to a community event, right?

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's what we're going to be doing
starting next week. You'll start seeing

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
promotions about that at least five days
in advance to give you guys a heads up of

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
what it's going to be, when it's going to
be.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We'll start off similar to how we did
before and see how that goes with

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
everybody in the frame of this YouTube
channel and broadcasts at Twitter.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm looking forward to it. It's going to
be a lot of fun. It's always tough to

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
gather everybody together, kushti, Joe,
myself, Dan, with our schedules, and

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
figure out exactly who's going to be there
and when it's going to be there on

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Thursday.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So these chats, I think, are great where
a couple of us show up next week, next

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
group, next week, and the community's
there.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So very community-centric, which is
exactly how Ergo should be.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Also, that being said, this AMA is going
to be very short, mainly to announce that.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Also to give you some updates on what
we're doing.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And I can try to answer any questions
that are in the capacity for me to answer.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Paul Sargeus asks, when live stream with
Mark? And he says, no, the Kraken guy.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That will be, I just pinged kushti,
actually, and Joe's asleep, so I didn't

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
bother pinging him, but MGPi sent me the
chat.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And so I sent it to kushti and Joe and
ask them if they wanted me to facilitate

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
it for them.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So I think that's great. If we can get
Mark, it'd be amazing if we can get Kraken

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Mark in a community AMA, but I understand
people might want more of a sophisticated

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
podcast between somebody like kushti Mark
and Joe to chat about that kind of stuff.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So I understand both of them, but either
one would be cool. So yeah, let's try to

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
facilitate that and get that going.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's going to be exciting.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All right, let's see what else. Ergo's
hashrate's pretty not terrible, right?

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's been down to five in the past couple
of months and the other day it's up to

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
seven. Again, seven, almost eight, so not
doing terrible there.

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There has not been discussion given Ergo
added to Phantom Wallet, Gandalf, that I

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
know of. So don't have an answer for you
on that.

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
All right, so let me go over some things,
new things, at least on my front that I've

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
done recently. It's been a really busy two
and a half, three weeks with the semester

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
starting back up at school.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So I've kind of been just working with my
head down and popping into Ergo when I

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
can, but that doesn't mean that things
have stopped.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We just added a new user to a new member
to the Ergo InfraDAO, that is the Stroof.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He is, I believe he's an Oracle runner as
well. He's spun up some hardware and we

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
have load balance into as well. So super,
super cool.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Anybody has those URLs? They're in chat.
They're on the InfraDAO page.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You can point your Nautilus wallet or
your ErgoMobile wallet or whatever you

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
choose to use to the peer-to-peer nodes.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And they are geo load balanced. So that
means right now we only have East Coast of

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
the US and Australia. So two very
different things, and Singapore as well.

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So depending on where your location is
and whatever is closest, the load balancer

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
will send you to that peer-to-peer node or
GraphQL or API or Explorer. So really

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
excited about that. Super cool.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, Bevis, it wasn't false. We're still
on the short list per se, right?

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So if you missed it before, we had
discussions and chat with, not Mark, but

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Mark's replacement, whoever that guy was.
I think Joe, kushti, myself, Mark,

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Blaskauer, and chats with him.

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And it was tough to pin them down in
exactly what was the requirement for being

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
listed on there, right?

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And so the thing that I spoke about in
recent AMAs was that the easiest path that

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
they thought forward for Ergo in the
immediate, right, long term would be the

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
native coin on the native chain on Kraken.

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But in the short term, the idea was that
we could get Rosen-ERG from Cardano

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
listed.

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And so then we saw Joe come up with a
proposal for Rosen Bridge to actually

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
airdrop Rosen-ERG to people in Cardano to
increase the wallet count.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And that's still in Paideia. So it's
interesting to hear people interested

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
about in chats here, but not engaging in
Paideia.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So again, what I say is if you're
interested in this kind of thing, you

77
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
should hop on Paideia and you should join
in the discussion for that proposal that

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
would take Rosen raised funds from the
GARD's and distribute some of them to

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
wallets to make that goal that, this is
named Dave, I can't remember his name,

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Kraken Dave, make that goal of X amount of
wallets in Cardano that would say, okay,

81
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
there's enough wallets and holders for us
to do that.

82
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I mean, honestly, we're, Ergo is a
different beast, right?

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We're dealing with these, even the guy we
dealt with, even Dave, again, I hope his

84
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
name's correct, seemed to understand,
there was confusion at first of what chain

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
we were on, that kind of thing.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So once that was cleared up, there was,
oh, hang on, I gotta stop this call from

87
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
coming in.

88
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
There was talk about integration, right,
and how that works. So it was kind of

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
teaching him to be able to do that.

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So then when he came up with the
requirements, it really felt like to us

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
that it wasn't like a sheet. It's not an
Excel sheet that he's looking at or a CMS

92
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
that he's looking at saying, okay, in
order to be listed, we need to hit these

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
marks and these marks.

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It really felt like he pulled those
numbers out of his ass, to be frank.

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So we're still, the idea is we still try
to hit that. It's not going to be a

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
challenge to hit that over in Cardano with
Rosen Bridge. And we approach with that

97
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and we see what happens.

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So I encourage you again, if you want to
see that happen, if you want to see

99
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
something like Rosen Bridge listed on
Kraken, then please go to Paideia, go

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
check out I think it's proposal three or
four that is up on the GARD's DAO for

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Rosen Bridge, but it's obvious in the
title what it is or in the body of what

102
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
that proposal is.

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It makes some comments on it and then
encourage people to vote on it, guys.

104
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We're a community, right? Nothing happens.
We can't wait for mommy and daddy to push

105
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
us along, right?

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's up to us to take that and embrace
that. Because if we can't bootstrap

107
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
ourselves as a community, then what's the
point, right?

108
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Augustine says, can you please explain
what this new DAO is you're mentioning?

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah, so the DAO is the InfraDAO, and our
goal is essentially to remove reliance on

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
centralized EF servers, right?

111
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Ergo is a peer-to-peer protocol, so why
should we need to rely on a central entity

112
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
to host the shell, the core blockchain of
Ergo, the nodes, the explorers, and those

113
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
kind of things.

114
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What the DAO does is it brings in members
who have their own hardware and have a

115
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
decent internet connection and uptime. And
we've made a package for Explorer and

116
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Node.

117
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And we have people to run that. And once
they're fully synced, we add them to the

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Cloudflare load balancer. And as I said
earlier, geolocation spreads to those

119
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
people.

120
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So right now, it's myself and two other
people. A third person has spun things up

121
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
on a raspberry pie, but it's just not
quite fast enough.

122
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So they're actually going to get one of
my spare machines here. We're going to

123
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
send it to them. And there'll be a fourth
person.

124
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
There's two people actually from Cardano
Stake Pools that we're interested as well.

125
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Once we get this fourth person up, we'll
talk to those guys again and bring those

126
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
in.

127
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So it's looking really good. It's looking
awesome. The hope is that we have 10, 20,

128
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
30, 40, 50, it'd be amazing to have that
many people on it.

129
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So that's essentially the start, right?
And once we get enough people running

130
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Explorer and Node on there with GraphQL
and API, we can look into other hosting

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
methods as well.

132
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Say that the Ergo Miner now wants more
robust and spread out mining core

133
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
instances. We could host those on some of
them. We can host things like ErgoExplorer

134
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,000
run by Aco or SigmaSpace as well, right?

135
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That browser. So all that stuff is
possible there when you deal with open

136
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,000
source and volunteers, right? So that's
the idea with that.

137
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Sigmanauts asks, we need to be louder on
social media. Who runs a Sigmanauts

138
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
account on X? It's been a week since the
last post. Please post more high quality

139
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
content in community posts.

140
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You guys, we're looking for volunteers,
right? These things don't run themselves.

141
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This is community organization. If you see
an issue that the posts aren't coming fast

142
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
enough and you have the time to see that
issue, then maybe you should take the time

143
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
to be a delegate of the account and post
as well.

144
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I invite everybody that wants to post in
promotion of Ergo on either the Sigmanauts

145
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
account where you can start off. And if
you prove yourself, then we can promote

146
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
you to the main Ergo platform account.

147
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Please, by all means, DM me. We'll start
you up on the Sigmanauts account. And if

148
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
that works, then great. We'll get you up
there.

149
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But yeah, we need you. We need your help,
right?

150
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Dan is sleeping, if that's what you're
asking. It's probably 11 o'clock in Japan.

151
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Something I want to show you guys that's
kind of cool. Let me minimize my screen

152
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
here.

153
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
We're going to be doing this, hopefully
I'm going to make a push to CodeUTXO on

154
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
this at some point.

155
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Something I've done at work here is I've
noticed that there's a ton of, there's a

156
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
good entry point videos, right?

157
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So a lot of people have made a lot of
Ergo videos about how to set up oracles,

158
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
how to set up nodes, how to make paper
wallets, how to set up cold wallets, all

159
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
that kind of stuff. People have made
videos.

160
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But what happens is those things can't
interface with AI, right?

161
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So what I found is I found that I can
take, and I've done this at school first

162
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
as a test, there's a piece of software
called Grasshopper that's built into a 3D

163
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
modeling program that's a fairly difficult
piece of software, but there's a ton of

164
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
video tutorials out there for it.

165
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So I've created subtitle files for these,
and I've scripted in timestamps and

166
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
bookmarks into every single line of the
SRT file.

167
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And so then I've ingested that into a
knowledge base in there, into the AI. And

168
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
then when you ask it a question, not only
does it come through all the steps that it

169
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
reads from that knowledge base, but it
also gives you exact locations of the

170
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
video.

171
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So I want you to think of this as like,
let's say I'm setting up a node, right?

172
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
There's a lot of documentation online that
the AI can access. And with the help of

173
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
these videos that people setting up nodes
and the AI knowing all the timestamps of

174
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
that, you can actually type in, hey, I'm
stuck on this part of the node. How do we

175
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
get past this?

176
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Well, then the AI will write to you and
say, hey, here's how you do this and this.

177
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And here's the exact spot in the video
that I'm talking about. And here's another

178
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
guy that does it. And here's an exact spot
in the video.

179
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So it works extremely, extremely well.
It's a big project to take on. But I think

180
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
that would be very beneficial for the Ergo
community, especially if you notice, I

181
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
mean, I'm a little older here, but AI is
essentially what a lot of the younger

182
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
generation are using now for, like even
their search engines, even like just

183
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
asking stupid questions.

184
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So it's an interface that these kids are
really, really used to.

185
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So we can swing that around and say,
look, if you don't want to scan through 30

186
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
hours of videos on how to set up something
on Ergo or how to do something on Ergo,

187
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
then type it into ChatGPT and it'll take
it right to that 10 second spot, the sound

188
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
clip.

189
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So for not only we can do that with
training videos, but we can also do that

190
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
with every single AMA ever made on Ergo,
right?

191
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So now when you type into AI about, hey,
what about this in Ergo? What happened to

192
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
this? The AI can say, well, Joe talked
about it in September of 2024. In December

193
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
of 2024, he gave an update. Here are the
two links to those videos right at the

194
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
bookmark where he spoke about those kind
of things.

195
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So the possibilities are amazing for
engagement and intake of information.

196
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm going to actually show you how it
works really quickly. Let's see. I can

197
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
share my screen here. Hopefully, I still
have the screen correct.

198
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
OK, so this is based on the application
that I did for our classes here. So I can

199
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
say, how do I make a spiral staircase?

200
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So it searches through the knowledge
base. It searches through all those SRT

201
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
files. Just imagine it's an Ergo. And it
takes you through every part of the way

202
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
that it knows how to do it from those
videos.

203
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And you'll see each part of these lines
has an actual link. So if I click on the

204
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
demonstration, spiral will be a
symmetrical points, it literally takes me

205
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
to that exact spot in the video where it's
doing that.

206
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Adjusting the radius and height takes me
to the exact spot in whatever video that

207
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
it's doing that.

208
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So now, as I said, imagine that with
Ergo, with all the AMAs, with every single

209
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
video that we've ever done, with all the
tutorials of wallets or anything like

210
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
that, now, you can hit that with an AI
model and it can spit out those points for

211
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
me.

212
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So, think about it also with somebody
trying to, we said we needed help with the

213
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Sigmanauts account for Twitter.

214
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Now, think about it, that person can just
go to this AI model and type in, give me

215
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
some cool things that have happened in
Ergo in the last month that I can make a

216
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
tweet about, and quote me something from
kushti too.

217
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Boom. And I'll spit that right out for
you from all the media that we've put out,

218
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
give you the links directly to the video
so you can add that to the chat. Done.

219
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So this is something cool that I think
you'll probably see in the next couple of

220
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
weeks or so as I'm working on it.

221
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And once we try to host it from CodeUTXO
on a local server, the credit should be

222
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
very, very, very cheap as far as that
goes. So look forward to that in the

223
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
future.

224
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Any other questions that I could answer
properly?

225
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Would I trust an AI agent with my key
phrase? No. Not my main key phrase. I'd

226
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
trust it with like a trading bot,
probably. If I put a couple hundred

227
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
dollars of ERG in a trading bot and let it
go, yeah, that's fine.

228
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You always got to think you're going to
lose it, potentially. Not just it's going

229
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
to be compromised, but the agent's going
to screw up in Dumpia or that kind of

230
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
thing. So just treat it that way, right?

231
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
All right. So just a reminder to
everybody, short AMA today. Thanks for

232
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
joining. We are moving fully to community
events after this for the time being.

233
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So I hope to see all of you in chats in
the Zoom meeting. Don't feel like you have

234
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
to turn on your video, but please come in
and ask questions in person and join us

235
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
that way.

236
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Continue the evolution of Ergo to the
peer-to-peer protocol and state that it

237
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
actually is and get us to a point that
really sets us apart more than we already

238
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
are from other chains right.

239
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
All right everybody thanks so much for
joining and kushti and I and hopefully Joe

240
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
will see you next week in community AMA
ciao.
