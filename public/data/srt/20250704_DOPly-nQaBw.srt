1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
All right.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Good morning, Joe.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
How are you doing, sir?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Doing pretty well.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
No complaints.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, thanks for joining me.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So this video is a part of a set of
content coming out for the summit.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And I was hoping to just do a little deep
dive into what Rosen Bridge is.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I would say right now, that's like one of
the most popular dApps on Ergo.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And in my eyes, like one of the things
that also expresses like the values of the

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
community and kind of executes really well
on a philosophy that's like not always the

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
easiest road, you know, and so I just
wanted to talk to you about that and get

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
your opinion, you know, maybe first tell
me like what is Rosen?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What makes it different and special as
opposed to other bridges?

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
All right, so Rosen itself is kind of an
interchange protocol, is a good way to

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
look at it.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's a transfer protocol between
different endpoints, okay?

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And part of what that gives the Ergo
community is an element of

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
interoperability, which is always nice,
but it's hardened access.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Access that basically we control right as
a community and that's powerful in this

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
space because there are certain terms and
conditions that

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
we kind of have to comply to or
potentially risk delisting, right?

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So you can use the example of privacy.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
There's only so far you can take that
before you run into a problem where it's

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
like the liability of your partners
becomes an issue.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And, you know, they have too much control
over your ability to access markets,

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
right?

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Aside from the cost

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
of access itself, it's also a
permissioned environment.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So the general idea is saying, OK, well,
you have these different markets where

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
liquidity is concentrated, and you also
have these consumer-facing wallets, as an

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
example, that we have the ability to back
in without permission.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And so that puts us in a much stronger
position long term, where we're no longer

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
subject to the

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
grace of external partners right and
that's something that Ergo kind of

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
suffered with because it was a fair launch
system so you know our

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
market access for a long time was largely
dependent on, you know, who we could pay

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and what their terms and conditions were.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Right.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And so I think having freer access that
we control as a community is powerful.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's something that's new.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You know, I'd like to continue building
it out to where we're available on a lot

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
of consumer facing entry points, you know,
Coinbase wallet, Phantom wallet, things

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
that people are familiar with.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
without needing the grace and permission
of a gatekeeper in between those

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
endpoints.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, okay, so you just told me the why
of Rosen, sick.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So just to restate, you built Rosen
because access to crypto was permissioned

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and dependent on all sorts of factors that
were not in your control, and most of

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
those factors were not aligned with your
values.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, okay.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
All right, sick.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So that's kind of what I was getting at
when I was saying like, yeah, Rosen is

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
like a good representative of the
ecosystem and just like, executes our

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
values very well.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But like, a lot of times, doing things
from a principal position makes them more

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
difficult.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Right.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're having to do all this stuff.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
How does that get accomplished?

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
How is Rosen actually different on an
implementation level?

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
One of my favorite things to do is look
from time to time at rekt.news.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Have you ever seen rekt?

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's just like this list of all the hacks
and two-thirds of them are bridges.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What is technically different about Rosen
that allows you to do this?

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So we dove into the security assumptions
of bridging before we designed it, right?

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So we kind of had like a first principles
approach.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
If we're going to design a bridge, the
first thing we need to really understand

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
is why do bridges fail?

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
right?

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And, you know, then take that knowledge
and try to implement a solution that, you

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
know, avoids the pitfalls that we've seen
in the space.

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And a large part of kind of this failure
process

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
In my opinion, it's what I would call
nonlinear scaling assumptions, where it's

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
like every time you add an endpoint, you
move into a new environment, you get new

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
logic if you're going the smart contract
way, which means you have new

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
dependencies.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And so it's like your attack vector is
growing faster than just one to one.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And that's incredibly hard to manage in
moving environments, which blockchains

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
are, you know, living, moving environments
that go through updates.

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You know, every once in a while we'll
have new standards, new logic.

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And so it becomes something that's very
hard to defend.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Right.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah.

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So, so maybe in simple terms, if one
blockchain upgrades, the other one

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
doesn't.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
your system now has to be reconfigured.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, we have to update and keep things
in sync in real time.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And that's just on the chain itself.

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Then you have all of the standards, the
logic of each particular chain, the

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
dependencies that you need to program the
logic.

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So you kind of have this chain of risk
whenever you get into

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Like smart contracts right where it's not
just the contract itself.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's also like the dependencies That
you're using to interact with the chain

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
could be broken and then that can be
exploited and then you have like a

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
downhill risk, right

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So instead of this mint and burn, which
is how most smart contract based

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
blockchains are configured, we have this
idea of lock and unlock, right?

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We use vaults.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And actually, you see that in Ergo
itself, where

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You know one of the complaints that
sometimes we run into is we don't have

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
like a smart token standard where you have
this ability to just create a contract and

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
mint and burn from it and part of the
reason why is you have like infinite.

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Mint risk right if somebody can exploit
that they can essentially mint infinite

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
tokens and so you know the first thing
that we do when we set up these vaults.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Is we will mint large supply of coins or
tokens will put them in a cold wallet and

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
then from that point is constantly audited
right and.

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We rely on this idea of kind of a
dual-layer multi-sig would be the simplest

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
way to describe it, where how Rosen
functions as a protocol is first you have

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
this reporting layer, and their job is to
scan.

111
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
They're auditors, right?

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Those are the watchers.

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The watchers, yeah, they're auditors
essentially.

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So they are constantly watching an
endpoint.

115
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If something happens, they report it to a
smart contract on Ergo that creates the

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
first layer of consensus.

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And the nice thing about that is we get
this idea of pre-truth.

118
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's like prior to execution, what is
supposed to happen?

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Which is kind of a failure point for a
lot of bridges because

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They learn something is wrong after it
happens.

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So having this idea of saying, OK, well,
this is what should happen, and then we

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
execute what should happen.

123
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
In my opinion, initially, I was thinking
clearance and settlement in the banking

124
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
system, where there are two distinct
processes where you receive something, you

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
have to go through an auditing process,
clear the transaction, and then it moves

126
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
to another stage where it executes
settlement and funds are moved.

127
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It works.

128
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So you don't really need to reintroduce
new things.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's just modernize it.

130
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And being that it's decentralized, then
we get into this idea of decentralized

131
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
incentives, which is profit distribution.

132
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's one of the most powerful things we
see with blockchain is this ability to

133
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
distribute profit.

134
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So Rosen leverages that to try to create
like a community and people that are

135
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
incentivized and earn from bridge
transactions.

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So in a way, it's kind of like your
mining interchange, if that makes sense.

137
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah, it does.

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It does.

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I think I really appreciate the approach
where it's like, okay, we recognize the

140
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
limitations that we're dealing with.

141
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
in terms of people's intentions and also
just like, oh, like, why can't this just

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
be automated entirely?

143
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You know, it's like, so we've come up
with a solution that aligns people's

144
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
incentives.

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So as you said, it's like a community of
watchers.

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I mean, there's hundreds of watchers.

147
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yep.

148
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
At this point, there's a couple hundred.

149
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's something like we could have built a
system that didn't include profit

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
distribution, right?

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But then it's like, okay, you no longer
have a check on the system and you no

152
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
longer have an incentive for
participation, right?

153
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And I really hope, I know Rosen is kind
of new and we're still working into new

154
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
environments and we're still in the
process of figuring out like the

155
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
politics on top of chains of how to get
added into different applications,

156
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
infrastructure, etc.

157
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But my hope is that, longer term, we now
have this layer of people that are

158
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
incentivized and profit from growth.

159
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And that becomes powerful because then
you have a community that can push the

160
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
adoption of Rosen itself versus just a
team building stuff.

161
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah, and it's also a functional machine
that grows over time.

162
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Not like a burn, as you were mentioning,
having to pay people to access their

163
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
thing, you know, it's not you're not just
like subtracting funds out of the Treasury

164
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
until it hits zero.

165
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's an actual it's an actual working
machine that

166
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
powers itself through this profit
incentive.

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Super cool.

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And a lot of the times when you see
market listing, it comes with this

169
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
friction cost up front and there's a
certain incentive that the team's going to

170
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
recoup that.

171
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And that creates a weird alignment of
incentives itself because now you have a

172
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
team potentially trading against their own
ecosystem to recoup the cost of working

173
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
with a third party.

174
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And that's unfortunately quite common, it
seems, with listings because in many

175
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
cases, when you're talking larger
exchanges, you can get into the millions.

176
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There was an article, as an example,
somebody

177
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
listing on a Korean exchange and paying
$10 million.

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That's more than the entire history of
development, funds, exchanges, everything

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
we've done on Ergo just to work with the
third party, which is insane.

180
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The incentives don't line up.

181
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Wow.

182
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Is there anything else about the
implementation of Rosen that you wanted to

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
talk about before the next topic?

184
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Sure, I think that we've made a couple of
choices that are probably, I don't know,

185
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
non-standard in the space.

186
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
An example would be we call ERG that's
wrapped RS-ERG.

187
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And it's because we want to let people
know that there is additional security

188
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
complexity.

189
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
A lot of the times, security complexities
in crypto is very buried.

190
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
to where it's obfuscated until we find
out there's a problem and then post-mortem

191
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
we figure out what the problem was.

192
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And that's kind of a terrible design.

193
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So my hope with the overall design and
having everything open source public

194
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
facing, anybody can join if they're
willing to stomach some economic friction

195
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
to make sure that the bridge doesn't get
spammed.

196
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
less that's hidden from end users.

197
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And I think that that's a big part of the
strength of Rosen itself.

198
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Just not ending up on rekt.news.

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yeah.

200
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah, exactly.

201
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's the goal.

202
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I would be rekt if that happens.

203
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yeah.

204
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah.

205
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
OK.

206
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I think I agree with all of that, man.

207
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And I think you've explained it pretty
simply.

208
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Maybe one more open ended question.

209
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Just kind of like long term, what's your
vision for Rosen?

210
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Well, I think that we have a couple of
verticals that we can really build on.

211
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So in the blockchain space, we have this
idea of layer twos.

212
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And essentially what a layer two is, is
it's the idea of pre-confirmation with the

213
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
assumption things are going to settle
later.

214
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And so like one thing we will run into
periodically is Rosen is slow.

215
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's slow by design, right?

216
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But you want additional checks on your
funds.

217
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So when you get faster transactions
between systems that like finality and

218
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
proof of work is based on how many blocks
have been added, right?

219
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So the sooner it's final, the less secure
it is.

220
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You know the same is potentially true in
proof of stake where you have like the

221
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
historical rollback You know or you know
you can say okay on this chain the longest

222
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
rollback has been 60 blocks So if we shoot
lower than 60 blocks, you know, we're

223
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
assuming that that's never gonna happen
again and it could right Yeah, so you're

224
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
inheriting a lot of

225
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
security complexities in different
environments that are not always

226
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
straightforward to understand.

227
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And so we said, okay, let's build this
slow, let's make it secure.

228
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And most users do want speed, right?

229
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And it's something we have the capacity
to do, essentially what that would, again,

230
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
let's just take from what exists that
works.

231
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
In the banking world, if you want a
faster transfer, you pay a premium, right?

232
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And so we potentially can build a system
around Rosen, not within it, but around

233
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
it, which is an important distinction to
make, where you have liquidity providers

234
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
on either endpoint.

235
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Somebody sends and they say, I want to
pay extra to have this settle faster.

236
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The liquidity provider will basically
assume the risk of faster settlement for

237
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
premium.

238
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and then the bridge transaction will pay
them on a delay.

239
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Users get their funds faster, the
liquidity provider gets a premium markup,

240
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and the core assumption itself doesn't
change.

241
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
In building around Rosen, that's
something that we need to be very mindful

242
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
to protect, because as soon as you start
to introduce leverage into bridges, you

243
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
get economic security complexity, which is
its own crazy vertical.

244
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
We saw that with THORChain as an example,
where they said, hey, we're going to have

245
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
where we're going to create DeFi inside
of the bridge and that's a terrible idea.

246
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah, the whole thing was like a short on
Bitcoin and like, oh, it went up so

247
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
everything fell apart.

248
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeah, it's potentially really, really
profitable, but it introduces just

249
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
assumptions that are breaking.

250
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:24,000
My base rule in bridge design is, okay,
we want to not rehypothecate assets.

251
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Just that simple.

252
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We want to keep everything one-to-one in
a way that's transparent, auditable.

253
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Any user can check that.

254
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And it's strange because we even see
custodial solutions on Coinbase, right?

255
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And the auditability there is a little
foggy.

256
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Somehow we've created a better custodial
solution than most of the exchanges that

257
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
are working with Fortune 500 companies,
which is kind of insane to think about,

258
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
but that's, I don't know, state of the
space.

259
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah.

260
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah, man.

261
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
OK.

262
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So long term, you're imagining Rosen
connecting all the major layer ones.

263
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Is that the goal?

264
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Both.

265
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
If you look at product differentiation,
there are a ton of bridges that work with

266
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
ETH because you have parallel logic via
the EVM.

267
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And so I think that if you're going to
compete, you need some sort of competitive

268
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
advantage.

269
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And one thing that Rosen

270
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The natural advantage of Rosen itself is
that it was designed to work across

271
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
non-compatible environments Right, so I
look across at other projects that you

272
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
know are similar to Ergo and in terms of
You know, they don't have this I'm gonna

273
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
call it an insider advantage in terms of
working with a lot of partners in the

274
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
space but they're technically rich right
and

275
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You can look at proof of work projects,
Nervos, Alephium, Kaspa, they're real

276
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
projects.

277
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
There's a lot of research, a ton of
engineering that's just disrespected.

278
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That's not what the space respects at
this point.

279
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And so I'm saying, okay, well, if I look
across at different projects and I see

280
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
that they have these same friction points
in terms of market access, building into

281
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
them creates a richer ecosystem with a lot
more technical depth.

282
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
you know, versus, you know, you look at
Binance and, you know, it's a combination

283
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
of food and animal items, you know, that
they're listing today.

284
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's like, well, where, where is like the
technical depth and engineering and like

285
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
development mind share there?

286
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
There's none.

287
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
There, there really is none.

288
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And it kind of creates its own like
idiocracy in crypto.

289
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So I do think that using

290
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So, Rosen is like, you're looking at the
problem that you experienced as an

291
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
individual, recognize that everyone who is
not operating under these perverse

292
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
incentives

293
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
also experiences that.

294
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And so you're trying to really be a boon
for the blockchain industry and for the

295
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
principles that you really agree with and
saying, like, you don't have to jump

296
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
through all these hoops to take part in
this revolution that's happening right

297
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
now.

298
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's really cool.

299
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah, I mean, like long-term, if we have
the ability to backdoor where liquidity is

300
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
concentrated, we're no longer beholden to
that aspect of the industry.

301
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And I don't like to deal with them, you
know, like I've had years of meetings with

302
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
teams where it's like they're, I don't
know, they're focused on flashy metrics

303
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
that usually- They look like Mr. Burns
like trying to take your money.

304
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yeah, kind of.

305
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I mean, they're focused on flashy metrics
that don't necessarily translate into

306
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
anything valuable other than like this
ability to pseudo and honestly extract

307
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
value.

308
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That's what I would say.

309
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So, you know, it's hard to have a
technical conversation, you know, versus,

310
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I don't know, there's a value misalignment
in crypto, in my opinion.

311
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
This is structural where it's like, if
you look at how traditional finance

312
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
operates in like the VC world, they'll
have like a five to 10 year window where

313
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
it's like, okay, you're gonna build this
and then we're going to slowly push for

314
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
the adoption of, you know, whatever you're
building.

315
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And that adoption curve is not
instantaneous.

316
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And so a lot of VCs in crypto, because
crypto has this amazing ability to create

317
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
liquidity right out of the gate, they're
looking at the liquidity risk curve and

318
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
not the adoption curve.

319
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So their focus is backwards.

320
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And so then you have a lot of things that
are introduced to market that have a lot

321
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
of marketing hype.

322
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And they're very liquidity curve driven.

323
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
but they're not adoption focused.

324
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Axie Infinity was like the biggest thing,
you know, it's like, oh, like, cool,

325
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
didn't really do anything, made some
people a ton of money.

326
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah, it doesn't relate to adoption.

327
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And if like if you're focused on like the
development side and you're looking at the

328
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
adoption curve, you have to realize, you
know, okay, where is Rosen going to be in

329
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
five years?

330
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That's, that's kind of the goal.

331
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Where can Rosen be in 10 years?

332
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's the goal.

333
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's not like where is Rosen going to be
on the five minute chart against Bitcoin?

334
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You can't think like that.

335
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Never build anything.

336
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And your whole approach has been like,
how do we build to withstand that 100-year

337
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
flood?

338
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Not like what happened this past year.

339
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And then think you're good.

340
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I love it.

341
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The crypto space is increasingly fragile,
in my opinion.

342
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
As things become more mainstream and more
subject to the whims and

343
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
like choices of like the political
environment you know things are going to

344
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
potentially be more fragile right and so
our goal is as like an industry at least

345
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
when i started was how do we create
non-fragile systems to where

346
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
something that's not going to fall apart
when the other team gets elected or

347
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
whatever.

348
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Exactly.

349
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Exactly.

350
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
We need to be able to withstand ideally
state level attacks.

351
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
That's kind of the idea Bitcoin was
founded on.

352
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And so we've tried to follow design
principles that will

353
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
support that in really harsh
environments.

354
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That was the goal of Rosen's.

355
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
How do we make unstoppable access that
way if KuCoin gets their access to work

356
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
with Americans pulled and exchanges say,
hey, you have this mixer on your chain

357
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
that we don't agree with, so we're going
to delist you.

358
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
How can we navigate those type of attacks
without losing our tether to larger

359
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
markets?

360
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So, Rosen is kind of an ongoing attempt
to harden, you know, make Ergo hard to

361
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
kill, basically.

362
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yeah, I love it, man.

363
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
That's good.

364
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Okay, so I just wanted to jump into the
Rosen site real quick and just kind of

365
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
show people what this is and maybe how to
use it.

366
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So, can you see that all right?

367
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
All right, so this is the list of locked
assets.

368
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So just to give people an idea, there are
like over 40 different tokens that can be

369
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
sent and couple of coins.

370
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And these are across Ergo, Cardano and
Ethereum right now, is that correct?

371
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And Binance is just now, yeah, Binance
just now started.

372
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
What else is like coming down the pike?

373
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So I think one of the most exciting
things that we have been working towards

374
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
is been wallet integrations, right?

375
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So right now we have this application
that the user needs to go to find and it

376
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
kind of creates additional friction and
complexity in terms of like the bridging

377
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
process.

378
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You know, I've been like,

379
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't know, on the Nautilus wallet team
since that came out, and MHS, who's my

380
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
co-founder, has his own wallet actually,
Minotaur, that he was working on in

381
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
parallel.

382
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And so our goal long-term was to say,
okay, let's get the Ergo ecosystem wallet

383
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
game kind of leveled up, and then we need
to create an SDK to allow wallets to

384
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
actually integrate Rosen into the
interface.

385
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
which hopefully will make the bridging
process itself a lot simpler because it's

386
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
happening from a single UI rather than
bouncing across the website and the web

387
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
extension or the node wallet or wherever
you're coming in from.

388
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I do think in terms of the front-facing
aspect of Rosen, that's going to be a big

389
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
development in 2025.

390
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You know, part of the reason why, you
know, we were, I don't know, maybe a

391
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
little bit slow out of the gate with that
is when you create an open SDK, you, I

392
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
don't know, you kind of create this
parallel incentive to where

393
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
There's an opportunity for somebody to
integrate a thing that looks like Rosen

394
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
wallet.

395
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
That's not right.

396
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
That's like the downside to open source
code sometimes is it's like, okay, you've

397
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
just given this recipe that somebody can
tweak with and say, okay, well now you're

398
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
using Rosen bridge, but actually you're
bridging to my wallet.

399
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah, so you got to have enough there to
like make it super obvious that yeah, we

400
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
need we need awareness in that because
that does happen sometimes where you have

401
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
like fraudulent front ends and that type
of that type of nonsense in the crypto

402
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
space.

403
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But I think we finally matured enough, at
least on the wallet side, where we have a

404
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
pretty good foundation to start plugging
that into.

405
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And then we can start working with
external partners, right?

406
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
We can say, OK, some of the Cardano
wallets that could potentially support

407
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Rosen in the interface and long term.

408
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
My hope is that we can take a lot of
these assets, you know, let's say Ergo as

409
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
an example that is traditionally seen some
friction in terms of how to access Ergo,

410
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
how to buy it.

411
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
and put it in consumer facing, wallets
that are very, you know, they, that have

412
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
adoption, you know, and when Ergo or RS
ERG can be bought in Coinbase wallet and

413
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
phantom wallet and that it's like, okay,
suddenly we can not only leverage the

414
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
liquidity of other environments, but we
also have like this ability to use all the

415
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
tooling built around them, which is
exciting.

416
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah, man.

417
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And just like to that point, I was
looking at this chart and I see is that 3

418
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
million ERG, 3 million ERG are currently
on the bridge.

419
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So one of my personal goals when we were
designing Rosen is it was like, okay, at

420
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
some point I'm hoping that the liquidity
in Rosen is equal or greater to the amount

421
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,000
that's held on exchanges, right?

422
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Because I know the cost of those
listings.

423
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Right, so I can't just say hey, this is
how much it was openly I'm sure people can

424
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
audit it because everything the Ergo
Foundation did was transparent But it's

425
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
like that that gives me a real Like
numerical value in terms of the market

426
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
that I've created and how much it would
cost and pair work with a third party and

427
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
so right now You know Rosen is one of the
largest

428
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
exchanges in simple terms.

429
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So that kind of makes me look back and
say, okay, well, the cost savings was

430
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
definitely worth it and market that no
longer is beholden to regulations or a

431
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
company's internal risk assumptions.

432
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Because at any point, any one of these
exchanges could, in theory, pull an FTX

433
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and blow up.

434
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You know, not only do we have the
regulatory risk, but you have their own

435
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
like internal risk in terms of how they
manage assets and leverage and hacks and

436
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
all this.

437
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yeah.

438
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And now you have this system that
includes hundreds of people and is open to

439
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
including more people if they wish that is
securing this portion of the supply.

440
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
That's really amazing.

441
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Good work, man.

442
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Thank you.

443
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I thought this page was really
interesting as well.

444
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
You can just like a live view of
everything that's going on.

445
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And you can see kind of what's getting
sent from where to where.

446
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You can check yours.

447
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You send yours.

448
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It's like, oh, it's been like 30 minutes.

449
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
What happened?

450
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And you can see, OK, I'm good.

451
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm good.

452
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Just be patient.

453
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And the whole thing is just really easy
to use.

454
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So when I look at this, it's really just
picking, where am I going from?

455
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Where am I going?

456
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And then you plug your address in and
then you select the token that you're

457
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
sending and the amount.

458
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Then you get a depiction of your fees and
the cost of transfer.

459
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I know some people kind of, they didn't
like the time.

460
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
They wanted it to be faster and then they
also wanted it to be cheaper, of course.

461
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
But really this was really intentional
and I think I understand why

462
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
things are the way they are and you know
it's like you're paying for, you get what

463
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
you pay for.

464
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Well you know even if you were to like
spin up a phantom wallet right now and

465
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
build a bridge from say like Solana to
Ethereum right in that inner wallet bridge

466
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
it's actually the exact same cost and the
difference is instead of being distributed

467
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
to like a

468
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
open group of watchers, that just goes to
one party.

469
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So like on a fee footing, we're actually,
you know, pretty much in alignment with

470
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
where the industry is, you know, in terms
of like bridging.

471
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
The difference is where the payment goes.

472
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah, yeah, that's really good, man.

473
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
That's really good.

474
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I get it.

475
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I think what you're doing is important.

476
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And and I hope that that people from the
other ecosystems can

477
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
you know, watch this video, see other
content and kind of recognize that it's

478
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
not just like us fighting them for like
the 400th rank in market cap total or

479
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
whatever.

480
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Like, like, like, no, man, we're trying
to make, build some value and and really

481
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
like change what the whole top 100 top 50
projects looks like.

482
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Yeah.

483
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And there's one little hidden bonus in
Rosen that I really like.

484
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
That's just kind of a function of using
the Ergo blockchain is and that's like

485
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
when we create the initial like threshold
based report on Ergo.

486
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
we create a transaction that pays miners
downstream.

487
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But we also create a box that lives on
Ergo for about four years and it does have

488
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
some ERG in it.

489
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And then four years later, it's cleaned
up and it pays miners again.

490
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So every Rosen transaction technically
will pay Ergo miners twice.

491
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Wow.

492
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Yeah, that's cool.

493
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Storage rent strikes again.

494
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Yeah, so long term, you know, it's like
if we can connect to enough ecosystems and

495
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
get enough transactions through, we're
actually paying miners twice for every

496
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
transaction, plus we're paying this, you
know, set of watchers on top of Ergo.

497
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And ultimately, I do think that profit
distribution is the greatest power of

498
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
blockchain, right?

499
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That's its superpower and unfortunately,
I think more and more we're seeing profit

500
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
extraction being used as the superpower of
blockchain, which is backwards.

501
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Yeah.

502
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Yeah.

503
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So is there anything, any place we should
send people who want to learn more about

504
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Rosen, maybe how do you participate as a
watcher or

505
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
How do you connect your chain, those
types of things?

506
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Sure.

507
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I would say that in terms of the general
public, if they want to learn about it, I

508
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
think one of the best places would be the
Discord or Telegram for Rosen Bridge.

509
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And part of the reason why is because we
have all of these infrastructure providers

510
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
that are constantly checking and updating
and actively providing system services to

511
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Rosen.

512
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And so you have like a depth of knowledge
that is me plus 200.

513
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And I would say collectively, the 200 are
better than me actually at troubleshooting

514
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
and figuring out exactly what's going on
with

515
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
you know, different problems, tweaks,
aspects of the system because they're, you

516
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
know, like actively incentivized to
participate.

517
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
You know, we do have Twitter where we try
to keep like the news feed rolling.

518
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
You know, we have Discord.

519
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So it's something to, you know, kind of
dig into in terms of like if a ecosystem

520
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
wants to join one of the things I've kind
of done in parallel and again it's just

521
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
based on like our own history at some
point we were looking at bridges right and

522
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
so you had a variety of

523
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Let's say documentation, sometimes coming
from an external system that's unique into

524
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
something that's standardized is not
really very straightforward.

525
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And so we started really trying to cook
documentation and onboarding stuff with

526
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
DogeChain, which is in the kind of
integration stages of development.

527
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
We'll probably see that live.

528
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I don't know.

529
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I say two weeks just because we always
need end-to-end tests and everything.

530
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm hoping that that comes with
sufficient documentation to where,

531
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
especially anything that's a Bitcoin fork,
it should be relatively straightforward to

532
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
follow and say, okay, you know, that's
potentially just that's a lot of value.

533
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
You have Bitcoin Cash Litecoin.

534
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You know, I think Flux is a fork of
Bitcoin, Namecoin, you know, a lot of

535
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
different stuff out there that use kind of
the Bitcoin

536
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
model and extended it in some way and the
same is true with the EVM right having

537
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Ethereum integrated really opens us up to
the potential to move across like EVM

538
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
compatible environments which I think will
happen naturally but

539
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Again, one of the greatest benefits of
Ergo itself and, you know, Rosen is

540
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
non-compatible environment.

541
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So how do we work with these systems that
are, you know, really unique?

542
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You know, one of my personal goals just
for

543
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I don't know, funsies, let's call it, is
going to be to create thresholds on top of

544
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Monero and relist Monero on different
exchange environments.

545
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Because that is ultimately going to be a
great test of, OK, we tried to build the

546
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
system to be resilient.

547
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So let's break a rule and see what
happens, right?

548
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Yep.

549
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
You've got to stress test it at some
point.

550
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And I think that's a great way to do it.

551
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And also potentially say, hey, this is
why we built the system.

552
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Because Monero is famous for crossing the
line and getting delisted from markets,

553
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
which has been kind of painful for them.

554
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
But their community has adapted really
well.

555
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Yeah.

556
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Yeah.

557
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Right on.

558
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Hey, well, I think this was a lot of
really good information, Joe.

559
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I appreciate you taking the time to meet
with me and explain all this stuff.

560
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And also just like thanks.

561
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Thanks for being a good representative of
a lot of the same values that I try to put

562
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
out into the world and for doing just good
work all around.

563
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So good on you, man.

564
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Appreciate it.

565
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Yeah.

566
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
All right.

567
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Have a good day, sir.

568
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You too.
