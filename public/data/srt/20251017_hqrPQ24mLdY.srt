1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
before we know if it starts on there.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
But welcome, everybody.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome to the Ergo Community AMA.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's like the eighth community one we've
done, maybe seventh, maybe sixth.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today joining us, we have Grayman and
CannonQ.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Kushti was here.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I think he maybe is experiencing some
connectivity issues.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hopefully, we'll see him back after he
gets connected.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It looks like we are live on YouTube too.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So everything's working.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Welcome CannonQ.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Welcome, Grayman.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
How was the... Oh, we got Jemai coming
too.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
How was the Ergo Meetup?

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I guess that's a big question.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
How to go from your point, guys?

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll let you go first, Gray.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't know if Gray wants to talk, sir.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
too much traveling, I guess.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Or maybe I have to make him, let me, I
gotta make him co-host.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I got a anti-spam protection.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
All right, hit it, Grayman.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You should be able to unmute now.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It was fantastic.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I got to put a face to some names that
I've admired for a long time.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Got to talk to them with, you know, the
real-time feedback that you can only get

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
from a in-person conversation.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And overall, it was just a nonstop,
intense experience of learning and sort of

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
understanding that I've made the right
decision to join this group of people a

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
couple years ago.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Started with Joe giving what amounted to
off the cuff remarks.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He threw away his prepared speech.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and gave a banger about sort of the state
of the industry and why we're here.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And then speaker after speaker, whether
it was technical or not, it just got to

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
more and more backing for the concept that
Ergo is a truly different project, that we

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
are true to the essence of Cypherpunk and
that we are here to stay.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and that the ideas that are cooking on
the front and back burners are going to

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
change the way everything works.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I think the funny part there, Grayman, is
that you think Joe actually prepared a

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
speech.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I think that's Joe for you, right?

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Always off the cuff, but that's always
ends up being the best, that's for sure.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, yeah, it was, it was a lot of fun.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You know, I said, you know, I was unable
to make it due to a last minute emergency.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But so I ran the show from the digital
side of the show from New York.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But, you know, sitting there all day,
waiting for

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I think I made the mistake of telling Joe
that the schedule is there, but it's not

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
super important to not feel rushed or
anything, and that was probably the

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
biggest mistake of my life.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There were times when I'm like, Joe, you
ready?

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You ready to go?

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And Joe's like, yeah, they're all outside
for a smoke break.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We're outside.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's probably going to be 30 minutes.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Then at lunchtime, you guys decided
instead to bring your lunch back to enjoy

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
yourselves out of the restaurant, which
was fantastic.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That was really funny, but we played it
and it worked really well.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But as I was saying, it was really
amazing to sit there and not be bored out

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
of my gourd.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
These typical things that I go to,
blockchain conferences or anything like

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
that,

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're sitting there and typically the
speaker gets in the way of what they're

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
trying to convey, even if they have
something somewhat interesting to say,

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
right?

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They get in the way either with ego or
with just trying to push something that

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
doesn't make sense or whatnot.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
or some corporate bullshit that I just
can't sit through.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But listening to these guys talk, all the
speakers that we had, MGPi, Ann and BR,

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Ken and yourself, Joe, Cheese, it was
absolutely fantastic.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Luca, everything that I listened to, I
was engaged in and able to understand.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I didn't even have to try to ask
questions or come up with any because you

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
guys really nailed it from your end,
keeping those guys engaged.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So that was amazing.

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I just want to say you guys did a
fantastic job presenting.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It looked like you had a ton of fun.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I hope you guys stayed out of the wacky
tobacco too much down there, did you?

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We didn't have the mic pointed towards
the audience.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm not sure that all the questions came
through, but I think the speakers did a

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
pretty good job of handling that.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And yeah, it was amazing.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It was anything but boring, especially
considering that a couple of these

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
projects are really just on the threshold
of coming to fruition, like Lithos.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I mean, this fall is going to be very
interesting for ERG, regardless of what

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
the market does.

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah, I agree.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I agree.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It was great to hear what's it called?

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
what's it called?

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Lithos.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That deep dive of Lithos was, I don't
know, that was great to listen to.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Just listening to what the possibilities
are and then the kicker at the end where

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
this is not even Ergo agnostic.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This can be applied to any mining chain
as well.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So it's amazing that we have people in
the community and people in the

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and the dev sphere here that build
because it's a great idea and then it can

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
help benefit more than just our wallets or
the people right in front of our faces

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
kind of thing.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So I thought that was really awesome to
hear that from Cheese.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What was the highlight?

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What was your highlight, Grayman?

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The night before for drinks.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and get our picture taken in front of
that shiny neon sign that said, girls just

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
want to have fun.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We were supposed to send that off to the
Cardano girls and see what they thought.

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But yeah.

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Sir, you sure that wasn't a male strip
club?

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's hard to pick a highlight because it
was, like I said, it was a very intense

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
experience.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I mean, it was nice to wind down
afterwards with that dinner.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah.

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Tell us about the dinner.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What happened?

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
FAKU plus Chris Ray did his, did a tour
of duty.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I think Benzo helped them to collect all
the stuff and get things prepped.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I was on KP because I was a professional
dishwasher earlier in my life.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So.

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It was delicious.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It was everybody.

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It was cook at the table basically and so
that encourages a certain amount of moving

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
around and talking to each other and sort
of winding down after all the talks.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The one regret that I have from us being
sort of disorganized about the timing of

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
things, I'm sure that was frustrating for
you, but we were sitting there thinking,

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
you know, anybody that didn't make it to
this thing, they can suffer.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You know, they're going to get to watch
this on YouTube anyway.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But my regret was that we didn't go to
the Garden of the Gods on a walk

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
afterwards, because by the time it was all
finished, it was time to get ready for

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
dinner.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And I guess a couple of people drove
there.

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
but I think they missed the sunset.

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It was wonderful.

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Awesome.

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Awesome.

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
How about you, CannonQ?

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Cannon, what was your experience?

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I didn't really know what to expect.

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The most interesting part to me was I've
watched

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
in recent and past history, like Luca,
Shashir, Cheese, Karat, even Allison, like

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
give presentations.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And I think everyone is more comfortable
with that now, which, I mean, the first

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
three I mentioned are all pretty young
cats for those who haven't watched the

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
videos.

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But all of their projects

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
or either like in a beta like live or
about to be there.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And so the thing that every one of them
said was, I even understand it better.

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Like a year ago when I was talking about
Lithos, I didn't really have it all

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
figured out yet.

149
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You know, and so there's an amount of
courage that goes into even presenting a

150
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
concept that you don't have all the
details fully fleshed out or how you're

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
going to get there.

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But then seeing those guys, that was very
impressive.

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
There's a lot of different

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
protocols, I guess, if you want to call
it that, that are coming online in the

155
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
next probably, let's say, six months,
maybe nine months, because there's

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
probably going to be snags at the end that
weren't foreseen.

157
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But there's three or four that aren't,
they're not done anywhere else, you know,

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
in quote unquote, crypto.

159
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Like, it's going to be interesting to see

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
how that goes.

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It just continues to be, you know, head
down and build.

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's just encouraging to see.

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So anyway, it was that was probably what
blew me away the most.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
There were too many things that I enjoyed
to say, like one favorite, one of the

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
One of the things I enjoyed was Joe,
myself, Shashir, Luca, and Karat went to

166
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Garden of the Gods.

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And of course we were 20 minutes late.

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You know, we were, I think HQ said it
best.

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We were one long block away from being
there before sunset.

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We missed it.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But.

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It was that was fun, you know, the
getting those guys out in nature and to

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Grayman's point, I wish everyone had been
able to go, but it was just, I mean, it

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
was late, trying to get everyone, you
know, moving around and stuff, but it

175
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
definitely has a different vibe than
trying to do everything just online.

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And it was crazy.

177
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I mean, there was three countries there,
three different countries, even though

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
we're out in South Colorado.

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So.

180
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah, good trip.

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And your talk was great, too, CannonQ.

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That was fantastic to hear that that kind
of thing kind of exists already in the

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
fiat world without blockchain and that
there's an option or an entry point where

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
you could possibly put that over top of it
and offer that.

185
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah, the funny feedback

186
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Joe's sister was there and she had had
poor experiences with barter like back in

187
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
the day like 10, 20 years ago to the point
where she wouldn't accept it if a client

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
asked if they would accept barter credit
she just turned the client down initially

189
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
like right there.

190
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And she was like, you know, what you're
describing is not my experience.

191
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And I said, well, this group in my local
region, I mean, they're really hustling.

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I mean, like it's shaking hands, kissing
babies, making sure that things happen.

193
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
They're involved in almost every
transaction that's over, you know, call it

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
four or $5,000 just to make sure
everything goes well.

195
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You know, so there's a lot of local
handholding on this kind of thing to make

196
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
it work well.

197
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So where a DAO could jump in that manner,
right?

198
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
An oversight DAO kind of thing.

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I think you're going to have to have even
like more handholding than that.

200
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But I don't know yet.

201
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You know, like I'm open to anything.

202
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Leave room for somebody to do some work
and make some money.

203
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And yeah.

204
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And these guys are already making money.

205
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
you know, in a conventional database that
they host system and the value add that

206
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
was presented is pretty intuitive to all
of us, but maybe not to people that are

207
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
already in that industry.

208
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And yet, by being in a barter or in the
position of trying to convince people to

209
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
barter their services and goods, they're
already sort of stretching what is the

210
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
normal

211
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
way of doing business in America, and so
they might be receptive to that.

212
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I think it's a fantastic idea.

213
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's more of a sales job than a technical
job, although I know, and so I was pretty

214
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
excited to see how much effort you put
into that presentation and presumably

215
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
talking to these guys down in Arkansas and
Louisiana.

216
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah, yeah, well, and let me get, so
here's the highlight.

217
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Joe's sister says that she's really
polite about it you know and she just flew

218
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
back home and she just sent a message to
Joe this was late last night he sends it

219
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
to me so before this is her quote so
before Saturday I hadn't heard the word

220
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
barter in more than a decade tonight I was
introduced to a guy

221
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And he is leading the charge of one of
the largest global barter entities.

222
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I mentioned very top-line what you guys
were talking about.

223
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And he is interested in learning more.

224
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What a crazy coincidence.

225
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Wow.

226
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The fates have aligned.

227
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What are you manifesting there, Cannon?

228
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah, I don't know, man.

229
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But it's just...

230
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I mean, it's sort of it's a joke, but
it's like good vibes, right?

231
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Like when I used to be on Twitter, I'd
post surf videos.

232
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I mean, those are like the happiest
athletes.

233
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I know they're bearing down, but, you
know, them and skateboarders got to be the

234
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
happiest athletes.

235
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's just good vibes, right?

236
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Because they're doing something you
shouldn't be able to do.

237
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And I think that's sort of where we need
to be.

238
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And it's

239
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah, I'm excited.

240
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I mean, it's it has to be basketball
players for sure.

241
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
For sure.

242
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Think about it.

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Think about it.

244
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
That's a job, man.

245
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's a job.

246
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
My business partner.

247
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That's true.

248
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I met professional tennis players, all
those things.

249
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's a job.

250
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's a business.

251
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Surfing is a good point.

252
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's still sort of ancillary, right?

253
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Like those guys are making money, but
they're not getting

254
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You know, twenty fifty million dollar
contracts and having to change their whole

255
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
life for it.

256
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But anyway, yeah, that was sort of the
full circle on even my little discussion

257
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
as a non-dev just for a crazy idea.

258
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So, yeah, I just want to I mean,
publicly, I said it there before the

259
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
recording, but thank you to Joe for

260
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You know, just saying now that sounds
cool as he and I were talking about it for

261
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
the last couple months.

262
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
He's like, yeah, why don't you present?

263
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm like, yeah, I don't know.

264
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And then I think he publicly said, oh
yeah, Cannon's going to present on this.

265
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So I couldn't really back out at that
point.

266
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So anyway, I appreciate it and appreciate
the opportunity.

267
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah, that was great.

268
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah, FAKU is there as well, right,
representative?

269
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I was hoping maybe next time we can get
FAKU to talk about local trades and those

270
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
kind of things with Honey and how those
kind of things work.

271
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And you can bring those into the
blockchain.

272
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But maybe we can get him to talk about it
next year at the next meetup.

273
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
How's that sound, Jermai?

274
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah, any thumbs up?

275
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Oh, did I make Jemai?

276
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Let me see if I blocked Jemai from
talking.

277
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No, he commented.

278
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
He commented.

279
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Okay.

280
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He said skater die next time.

281
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Perfect.

282
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Great.

283
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That sounds good.

284
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah, I think, I think this is a great
start.

285
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I think Kushti mentioned that he wanted
to have it in what's a Barbados?

286
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
No, some, what was the place Kushti
wanted it next year in Mexico?

287
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Acapulco.

288
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So it's the late February AnarkoPulco
conference.

289
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So.

290
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Let me check how big is that.

291
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
We may ask a route, so they visited it a
few years ago.

292
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What conference is it at that time?

293
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
AnarkoPulco.

294
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's a blockchain conference there?

295
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Or you mean just have the meetup there?

296
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So it's...

297
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So a lot of cryptocurrency folks there,
but yeah, it's basically anarchy related.

298
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So not necessarily cryptocurrencies, but
yeah, a lot of cryptocurrency folks,

299
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:16,000
including organizers, which are super OGs,
Bitcoin OGs, yeah.

300
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Oh, awesome.

301
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Okay.

302
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
All right.

303
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
We'll get that figured out, Kushti, and
then we'll start trying to plan it and see

304
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
how it looks.

305
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah.

306
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Let's see.

307
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So let's have a chat with Lutz or the
telegram.

308
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Great.

309
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So that's where Lutz is from?

310
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Lutz is from New York.

311
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yeah, so before, so now he's doing some
marketing for Komodo and before he did

312
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
some efforts for Pirate Chain and yeah,
they had a booth back in 2020 or 21,

313
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
something like that.

314
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So they invited us Ergo community back
then, but yeah, we didn't have folks back

315
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
then around.

316
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
to join.

317
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So yeah, not possible.

318
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So let's check what's pirates and other
communities.

319
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yeah.

320
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Not bad weather there too.

321
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Right.

322
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Cannon, you looked it up.

323
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It was like 80 degrees in February or
something like that.

324
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yeah, I think so.

325
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
OK, I think we can handle that, right?

326
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That's swimming weather.

327
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Maybe not in the Pacific, but definitely
for somebody in New York in the winter.

328
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Definitely feels warm.

329
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yeah, the Pacific's always cold.

330
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah.

331
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
For sure.

332
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What else?

333
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Ben, you were there.

334
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You were at the meetup, right?

335
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
No, I was in New York.

336
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Different Ben.

337
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You're not Benzo.

338
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah, all right.

339
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Too many Benz.

340
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I get them confused.

341
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Oh, yeah, my bad.

342
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Wrong profile.

343
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But yeah.

344
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, there you go.

345
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah, I was there.

346
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I had a situation where I left my
physical card.

347
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So the perfect use case was there.

348
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What did you do?

349
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I left my physical card and I needed cash
to make a purchase for some commodities.

350
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Okay.

351
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And I couldn't get these commodities in
Colorado that I needed without my physical

352
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
card.

353
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You know, tap is everywhere.

354
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You can have your debit card, credit
card, you know, whatever card, gift card

355
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
on there.

356
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So I'm thinking you can pay with that.

357
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
They're like, oh, we don't accept this.

358
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Don't comment that on my commodities.

359
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Oh, I think I think I know what you mean,
because some some facilities don't allow

360
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
credit processing because it's a federal
crime still.

361
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So they like cash.

362
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm not going to mention what that
facility is.

363
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So what'd you do?

364
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You found some nice guy who does like
local barter trading with honey and you

365
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
gave him some herbs?

366
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Yeah, yeah.

367
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I wonder who that could be.

368
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
He's like 6'10".

369
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You know what I mean?

370
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Works for the CIA.

371
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No, I'm joking.

372
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
No, I'm joking.

373
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
He had his cool chill shades on,
transition lenses.

374
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
That's my guy.

375
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So tell me the story.

376
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You sent him some ERG?

377
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yep.

378
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yep.

379
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
We made the transfer.

380
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I got cash in person and then we made a
quick transfer.

381
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So we got to do it in front of Anon,
which is nice.

382
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So if he's going in February, I'm going.

383
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That is awesome.

384
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Did your swapper make you wait 10 blocks
for confirmation, just like the central

385
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
exchanges do before they said it was OK
and you could have the cash?

386
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh, no, no, no.

387
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
They fronted me the cash because we're
all at the... That is Kushti.

388
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Yeah, it was just off the strength.

389
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It was just off the strength, you know.

390
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Pre-block time.

391
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You can see those tweets back in 21.

392
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Proof of history, right?

393
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Oh, that's awesome.

394
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I paid for my share of dinner with four
silver quarters.

395
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh, nice.

396
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Did you bring some dime bags as in silver
dimes, Grayman, with you?

397
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I brought a bunch of silver dime bags and
I've got some of those left over that I'm

398
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
not going to touch until I meet some other
people in person.

399
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And I also brought a handful of silver
quarters and gave one of those to

400
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
everybody that spoke along with their dime
bag and paid for my dinner with silver

401
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
quarters.

402
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
In fact, I overpaid a little.

403
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I gave them five of them.

404
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But then Chris needed a couch to crash
on, so he gave me one back.

405
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It was a I can't I can't pick just one
because Joe started off because I love the

406
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
rants.

407
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So whenever we get those type of rants,
I'm all that's my type of time.

408
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
But then I like the like by the book
accounting that Kenny was doing.

409
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But I really liked the Lithos.

410
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But the explanation that M.G.

411
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
gave was amazing.

412
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
When he gave his explanation about how
the differences between the styles of

413
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
contracts and how they're executed and all
that type of stuff in the trees, I was

414
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
like, oh man, that's dope.

415
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So everybody gave a great presentation.

416
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Oh, and then Anon's at the end with the
bytes.

417
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And then how many, 290 transactions?

418
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I was like, oh good God, that's not even
with sub-blocks.

419
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
3,601 for a minimum, and then 16,000, I
think, was the maximum with this.

420
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So mind blowing, right?

421
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's absolutely crazy.

422
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You're talking about Machina Finance, and
that was absolutely mind blowing for me.

423
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I hadn't really considered it before
because I'm not really interested in any

424
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
of these parts of crypto that resemble
stock trading.

425
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I don't give a shit.

426
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm here for the local exchange stuff.

427
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But listening to that was fascinating
because I know that one thing that people

428
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
are constantly wringing their hands about
is liquidity.

429
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And that's a system that could
potentially bring an enormous amount of

430
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
liquidity on chain passively without
investors having to actively make trades.

431
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
They just set its Machina Finance.

432
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
So basically within your wallet, without
going through central exchanges,

433
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
There's a bot that you spent a part of
your of your assets.

434
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You assign them to this bot and you tell
it I want you to trade within a grid

435
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
against other traders who are also doing
this and maximize my ERG stack or maximize

436
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
my SigmaUSD stack or whatever it is you
want to try and trade towards and assign

437
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
it that task or maybe even just assign it
the task of just collecting at a certain

438
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
price or something simple.

439
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
But you'll be able to do that.

440
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You'll be able to set it and forget it,
and it will trade against other people who

441
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
are doing the same thing without any ERG
ever having to leave or these other assets

442
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
ever having to leave the ecosystem.

443
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So now when people want to make a trade,
they don't have to worry about is there

444
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
enough liquidity at this particular
trading pair or what have you.

445
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
The first thing that they're going to do
is their machine is just going to try and

446
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
execute that trade for them.

447
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Now you can be patient because instead of
worrying that, oh shit, you know, I put my

448
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
assets on trade over and I'm waiting for
this trade to go through and I'm just

449
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
going to give it some time.

450
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
But all of a sudden the Canadian
government decides that they're going to

451
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
raid their offices.

452
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And suddenly the money that you had
waiting for your trade is gone and you

453
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
can't pull it back to your wallet.

454
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
This is non-custodial trading.

455
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And I don't think that any of these DEXes
are ready for what's coming their way.

456
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Once we get that shit online, it's going
to start slow because nobody knows.

457
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But once people figure out that that's
possible, why would you go to a DEX?

458
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yeah.

459
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I mean, anybody that knows anything, why
would you go to a DEX, right?

460
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah.

461
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And then over time is always going to be
the tightest spreads.

462
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
They can quote.

463
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
That's always going to be the argument.

464
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yeah, that question is getting more
people involved.

465
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And yeah, the main thing that centralized
exchanges have is they have the ramps

466
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
right now and they control the ramps.

467
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So Alex has mentioned a couple of times
like something like BISC or something, you

468
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
know, finding ways to go back in time sort
of.

469
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I think that'll be key for sure.

470
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:32,000
But I want to give a big, he gets it all
the time, but Alex Kushti, with you and

471
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:40,000
the guys that develop Ergo platform, I
think everyone there came away with a

472
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,000
bigger appreciation for how much foresight
you guys had and adding

473
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
AVL trees and NIPoPoWs and just all these
different, you know, the ability to add

474
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
sub-blocks after the fact.

475
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Yeah, I mean, just the way that the
protocol and the platform was designed is

476
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
we're all still scratching the surface,
but

477
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
All three of those young gigabrains, all
of them said, yeah, I think it was two or

478
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
three years in.

479
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And I was trying to figure something out.

480
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And Kushti was like, why don't you use
AVL trees?

481
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And Karat was like, what the hell is an
AVL tree?

482
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And he goes, now I use them all the time.

483
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Luca uses it all the time for Pidea.

484
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Everyone's using them, but they didn't
even know what they were.

485
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And his comparison was they have the
Merkle trees and trees on Cardano.

486
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
But it's almost like it's an L2.

487
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It's a bolt on.

488
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So there's still an air gap between you
and that tree where on Ergo, it's in the

489
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
base layer.

490
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It's just anyway.

491
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I mean, all of us were just in awe of

492
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
the research and the foresight that went
into this protocol.

493
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So thank you.

494
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's almost like Kushti could see into
the future, or at least learn from his

495
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
mistakes and pulled into that.

496
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I think one thing that people should have
hopefully picked up from MG Pai's talk

497
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
At least you have a guy that works for
Palm, which is a multi-chain company,

498
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
right?

499
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
They're on Ergo, they're on Cardano,
they're on Binance.

500
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
All right, so this guy's worked with
Ethereum contracts, this guy's worked with

501
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Cardano contracts, this guy's worked with
Ergo contracts.

502
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And here he is telling the community,
while he mentions, you know, Merkle Trees,

503
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
also

504
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
mentions that, you know, Ergo's tech in
that matter is better, right?

505
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Or more well thought out.

506
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And as Cannon said, bolted right in and
not bolted on top.

507
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So absolutely amazing to hear that from a
dev that's multi-platformed that can come

508
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
back and say, yeah, Ergo is kind of where
it's at with this kind of thing.

509
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Byron, just interrupt us.

510
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
No hands, man.

511
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Oh, no.

512
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'm going to go out to Kushti.

513
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
He was going to speak.

514
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Oh, Kushti.

515
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
What were you going to say?

516
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Yeah, actually, some notes I would like
to give.

517
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But the most important probably is about
local trade, right?

518
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So this is the thing we need to empower.

519
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So yeah, did a lot of

520
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
updates to basis contract and tracker
recently.

521
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And now, Grayman, I'm going to put silver
sense document in the Chain Cash repo, if

522
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
you agreed on that.

523
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And then, yeah, I think to add details
and yeah, try to get it technically sound

524
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
right and then implementable.

525
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
What do you think about that?

526
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You can do whatever you want.

527
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
That three paragraph thing that I put up
there was just a summary of a bunch of

528
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
other stuff that I've written.

529
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I've been trying to assemble something a
little bit more presentable in general,

530
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
both from like the 30,000 foot
perspective, but also one from the vendors

531
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
perspective.

532
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I like to think of things in sort of game
theory like who wants this and why and how

533
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
are they going to use it?

534
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So I have more writing

535
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Already done, but it's not organized
enough to commit to any sort of public

536
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
documentation.

537
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
But if you want to grab that and run with
it, go for it.

538
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I mean, there's nothing that I said in
there that I think is wrong.

539
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I just think it's incomplete.

540
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And also, you know.

541
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Silver sense depends on some stuff that
that just doesn't exist yet, including the

542
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
work that you're talking about doing, but
also just fundamentally.

543
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I mean, it needs Dexy Silver or some
other

544
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Silver stable coin that is independent of
the mechanism proposed in silver sense and

545
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
which is redemption by actual physical
silver by the issuing by the one that

546
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
issues the note.

547
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
But at the same time, I mean, forward
motion is forward motion.

548
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So go for it.

549
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Don't let me stop you.

550
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
All right, so let's try to understand why
it is incomplete, right?

551
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So yeah, I need to get through details,
right?

552
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And yeah, about Dexy Silver also in the
Gold Oracle Group, we had discussions just

553
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
yesterday or today.

554
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,000
depending on a time zone, merging silver
oracle code into the oracle pool

555
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,000
implementation and then it's possible to
run the silver oracle pool and then it's

556
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,000
just a question of

557
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
liquidity bootstrapping rights to launch
Dexy Silver or Gleon Silver.

558
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Then, yeah, I also recorded recently an
implementation of that scheme I've

559
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:35,000
proposed at some point on Ergo forum about
making insurance with digital commodity

560
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:43,000
for a physical

561
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
one, right?

562
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So it was about gold, like doing
insurance with digital gold for a risk of

563
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
physical gold non-delivery.

564
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So maybe it would be useful as well,
right?

565
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
In the context of SilverSense.

566
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Yes, it will.

567
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I was thinking about that paper because
it was speaking specifically about volts

568
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and how they would use it.

569
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And the entire point of SilverSense is to
give a special status, but also some

570
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
responsibilities to vendors as opposed to
customers.

571
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
So they all use it, but the vendors are
the ones that sort of act as the

572
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
distributed banking system.

573
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And so they would need, they would use
this essentially as a way to make it

574
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
convenient for trade between each other
and with their customers.

575
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And also as a sort of a form of
insurance.

576
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And so, you know, when they're trading
with other vendors.

577
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So I think, yeah, that that definitely
relates.

578
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And then there's also the reputation
system issues that would have to go into

579
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
it.

580
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
So when I was handing out these dime
bags, I was I was basically saying it was

581
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
essentially just a little bag.

582
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And, you know, for any foreign viewers
that don't know a dime bag is in the old

583
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
days, it was how you bought pot if you
were just buying a little

584
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And so, but these were, there was no
marijuana in this.

585
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It was just a silver dime and a paper
wallet that I printed using the MewMart

586
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Paper Wallet tool.

587
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And those paper wallets contained about
as much in tokens as the value of a silver

588
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
dime at the time that I minted them.

589
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And so now the race is, which is going to
be worth more per year.

590
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And silver's off to a good start, but
we'll see.

591
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm betting on ERG personally.

592
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
In any case, I told people, first of all,
don't put anything valuable on that paper

593
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
wallet, because I got the keys to all that
shit.

594
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And don't tempt me.

595
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And secondly, SilverSense itself is a
ways away from implementation.

596
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It's an idea right now.

597
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
But eventually, it's something that makes
sense just because we have this asset here

598
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
in America that I don't think is very
common of just this very large

599
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and already distributed current tokenized
currency that's uncensorable.

600
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So it's kind of a cool asset to take
advantage of, but it'll take some time.

601
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
We got to wind it up.

602
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Doesn't happen without forward motion.

603
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
So like I said, do whatever you want in
terms to push it forward and I will keep

604
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
growing as I can.

605
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
That's awesome.

606
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Byron.

607
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
You can let T-Maz jump in there.

608
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I think he was, or Kushti.

609
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'll go after everybody.

610
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Whoever wants to chat, just jump in,
guys.

611
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Go for it.

612
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

613
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So, Grayman, so, yeah, let's put some
more meat there, right?

614
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So, yeah, a lot of code get done
recently.

615
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
So, yeah, now we just need to connect the
dots, right, and understand, well, the

616
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
missing parts and the...

617
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Yeah, so Thomas authorized Kent.

618
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
On the note of the silver sense, I've
actually been trying to develop like a

619
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
prospectus to send into local credit
unions and like gold or coin shops.

620
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So my idea behind it is kind of like what
Grayman was thinking, you know, like a

621
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
local distribution hub of sorts almost.

622
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
So

623
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
The only thing is with it is that it's a
little bit confusing, like how you guys

624
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
were speaking about the bartering earlier.

625
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You know, a lot of people are kind of
like apprehensive, like, oh, this is on

626
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
the blockchain.

627
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And then they get like a little bit like
kind of sketched out.

628
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But I think overall, like given enough
time, there's really no way we'll be able

629
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
to get any large, like a tier bank to
support any of those kinds of transactions

630
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
just simply because

631
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
they just don't want to unless they have
a contract with somebody that's like an

632
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
insider thing like the DEXes basically
there's really no possible way that that

633
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
could ever be achieved so the next best
bet I figured is like local credit unions

634
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
like for example

635
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
This is different than like gold or
silver, but this is like even an expansion

636
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
upon the idea.

637
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Say you have like a thousand dollars of
like silver or you buy like some beater

638
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
piece of shit car that you take into your
credit union and you give them the title

639
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and then they'll give you a loan based on
that amount.

640
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But that can basically be like kind of
like a interactive way to like kind of

641
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
ATM.

642
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
transact via Ergo so like if you go to
your local credit union or your coin shop

643
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
and on on top of that like with the coin
shops they could even be like custodial

644
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
holders for the chain so they could get
like incentivized like if you pay for an

645
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
ETF like I think it's 0.05 percent for
like holding fees and stuff because

646
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
From what I have talked to the shops
about, that's their main concern for the

647
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
ones that there's actually a fair amount
of people that are interested.

648
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
They would just like a prospectus for it.

649
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So the main problem with them though, was
they were saying the amount of insurance

650
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
extra costs for the amount of inventory
added, there would need to be a way to

651
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
cover their insurance costs, obviously.

652
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
So that way they don't just have a whole
ton of gold sitting there for Ergo.

653
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
That's not insured.

654
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
But that's kind of like the route that I
was thinking about going down with like

655
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
how to implement Chain Cash and things
like that into actual function.

656
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So that's a little more centralized than
I'm thinking.

657
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
But I acknowledge that some degree of
centralization is necessary.

658
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So I'm a little less centralized because
I'm thinking this is not going to be

659
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
handled by credit unions or coin shops.

660
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's going to be handled by the vendors
that want to transact in this stuff.

661
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And the most valuable thing that's on the
network is not going to be the silver

662
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
dimes and quarters or the silver cents
tokens on Ergo.

663
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It's going to be the goods and services
that they're trading for those things by

664
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
definition, because that's why people want
to engage in that trade.

665
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So it distribute also by making it silver
cents instead of gold or like larger, more

666
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
numismatic silver or other precious
metals.

667
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
By just making it this simple crappy junk
silver, right?

668
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It makes it so that you can't really
accumulate enough of this to become a

669
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
target for, you know, organized crime or
the IRS.

670
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
But I repeat myself, you know, it's it's
more of a like a local commerce, small

671
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
amounts of money.

672
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
But if it caught on, those small amounts
of money have access

673
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
to about $15 billion worth of these
tokens that are already spread all around

674
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
this country.

675
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
So no bank, no credit union needed.

676
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
The vendors are the banks, the ones who
are selling their services, which is the

677
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
valuable part of the whole system.

678
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
That's what makes an economy.

679
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It's not money.

680
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It's the goods and services that are on
exchange.

681
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Money is just the token that moves it
around.

682
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Banks and coin shops love to gather that
stuff in and think about how they can

683
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
profit and make an economy off of money.

684
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
But the real economy is people cutting
hair, moving furniture, building things.

685
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
That's the economy.

686
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
So if you design it in such a way that
the people that are doing those things can

687
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
be the ones who are maintaining their
small portion of the bank, leaning on the

688
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
blockchain for the creation of this
credit.

689
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And for also accounting for, you know,
the distribution of these of these tokens

690
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
and then they just have to keep enough on
hand that they can redeem for like if

691
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
another vendor gets enough of these of
their silver cents in their hand, they

692
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
come back and say, look, I love you and I
love your haircuts, but I've got like $10

693
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
and silver cents here and that would get
me haircuts for the rest of my life.

694
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
How about you just go ahead and give me
the silver so that I can go and

695
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and buy something else with it for
somebody that does not yet believe in

696
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
these silver sense.

697
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And so that distributed issuance and
redemption is what makes it such that you

698
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,000
don't need credit unions, coin shops, or
anything quite that centralized.

699
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
It's still centralized, but I mean, it's
not totally distributed to the leaves of

700
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
the tree.

701
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I mean, the customers get to use this
stuff and maintain anonymity,

702
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
But the vendors themselves are the ones
who are kind of centralizing their notes

703
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
and promising to redeem their notes and
putting a time frame and a physical

704
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
location where they would do that on
chain.

705
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
So, exposing themselves to the world in
the sense that that information is going

706
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
to be out there.

707
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You know, philosophically, I agree with
you, Grayman, but I don't think they're in

708
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
opposition to each other.

709
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
So they can coexist different use cases,
different assumptions and fees for what

710
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
you do.

711
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So that philosophically, I'm on board
what you're saying, but they can coexist

712
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
with each other.

713
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And but I agree with you saying.

714
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
But I kind of think of the coin shops
almost like a local chime ATM service.

715
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Like if I want to go sell silver as of
right now, there's literally no way for me

716
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
to do it on the blockchain peer to peer
until Chain Cash comes out.

717
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And even then it's just algorithmically
pegged.

718
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Like it's not like the actual asset of
silver or the commodity of silver.

719
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So in a way, I feel like you have to have
like,

720
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
a minute physical distribution hub they
could I get exactly what you're saying

721
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
instead of them actually being like the
primary vendor they just use the service

722
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
in order to distribute it but I do like
with Byron like what he's saying I think

723
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
that there should be a way to at least
like partially incentivize somebody to be

724
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
a vendor for it all by not giving them too
much power over

725
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
The network in any regard basically just
simply like i was saying earlier like a

726
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
small like point zero five percent fee of
like whatever transaction costs they

727
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
handle.

728
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
On the network and like a gross value
basically.

729
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Well, they're collateralized.

730
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So their commodities that they want on
chain would be collateralized.

731
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
So if someone wanted to purchase that
collateralized form, they would redeem it

732
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
there.

733
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
These are just public vendors, just like
a store that you know you're able to do

734
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
this action at.

735
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
The whole point, what Grayman is talking
about, the everyday person is going to do

736
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
what Grayman's talking about, these small
amounts, but in the case that Grayman

737
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
accumulated over 40 years and wanted to do
something for a large amount coming out of

738
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
training, he would probably go that route.

739
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
So they can coexist.

740
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
They're not in opposition to each other.

741
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
They're just use case defendant.

742
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Like right now, you could get $100

743
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Face value for you know 3300 bucks from
one of these coin shops.

744
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
So yes, they're going to be the ones that
are going to distribute a significant

745
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
amount of actual physical silver.

746
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
They're already the concentration points
for this stuff.

747
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
So when I say that it's a pre existing
well distributed tokenized.

748
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Uncensorable currency.

749
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
It's pre distributed, but let's face it,
there are whales and there's, you know,

750
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
There's a lot of it out in people's sock
drawers, but people don't really think

751
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
about this shit right now.

752
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
If it changed and became something that
was used on a regular basis by people,

753
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
that would be because it became either a
necessity, which it might, if there were

754
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
like an extended power outage and internet
outage, then you might be trading dimes

755
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
and quarters.

756
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But also it might just be because it
becomes more convenient.

757
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
And that's the point of Silver Sense is
that it just becomes an app on their phone

758
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
that looks like a frequent customer card
or whatever from their perspective.

759
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And so they're just carrying that around,
but it's keeping track of, and they can

760
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
use it at other vendors, but it's keeping
track of value.

761
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And so the guys that are the vendors for
this, they might need to go and talk to SD

762
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Bullion or to their local coin shop

763
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
about getting enough so that they have it
on hand to redeem.

764
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
But again, the amounts of money can't be
that large.

765
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
That $3,000 sack of $100 face value is
not something you're just going to carry

766
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
around in your pocket.

767
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And that's only $3,000.

768
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Silver is just not that dense of value.

769
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
And so it protects you from getting
involved in the types of trading that

770
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
attract criminals and problems.

771
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
It becomes a waste.

772
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Silver has long been

773
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
the coin of gentlemen, the coin of people
just trying to get about their daily day.

774
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Gold is for kings, silver is for
gentlemen.

775
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,000
On the whole note of like the silver
sense thing too, I was also thinking, this

776
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
is kind of like where I get my idea from
for like my outlook on it.

777
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So for instance, I do a lot of scrapping
like with scrap metal and like gold

778
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
recovery and such.

779
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Basically, there is, unless I sell my
boards directly to a board sort, board

780
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:05,000
sort, they'll actually give you sometimes
$100 a pound for raw gold fingers.

781
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
But there's really no way to transact
that value into cash unless I give it to

782
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
the vendor to be able to sell it.

783
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Like realistically, nobody's really going
to go looking on chain on Ergo right now

784
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
just for like a single like, okay, oh, I
could buy scrap metal here.

785
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Oh, I could go buy silver bullion.

786
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
or whatever.

787
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And also too, there needs to be a way to
like, if I'm buying, part of the reason

788
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
why scrapping is so attractive is because
like if I have the gold or if I have the

789
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
copper just sitting there, that's
basically as good as just like $500 in

790
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
cash.

791
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
If I have $500 of copper, all I have to
do is just take it to the scrap yard and

792
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
they'll just give me the cash right there
on hand.

793
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
But like what if I want SigmaUSD for it
or something instead like what if I want

794
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Ergo SigmaUSD or I want Ergo tokens, you
know, that's where I feel like the thing

795
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
like silver sense and like that whole kind
of like Chain Cash idea would be really

796
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
useful there for vendors because then it
gives them an easier way to

797
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
like basically move value around without
having to use like a traditional banking

798
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
system and it's all tied into RWAs.

799
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Like I was saying earlier, you know, you
could even expand upon it even more.

800
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Like I'm pretty sure basis is doing this
or at least into the future.

801
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It's probably going to be the plan to
like be able to tokenize.

802
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Like if I want to, reverse mortgage my
house to Grayman, for example, I can sign

803
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
the deed, put it up onto.

804
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Like a DAO.

805
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Right.

806
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Then the DAO overview is like, okay,
yada, yada, he's got the title.

807
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Here's bill of sale.

808
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Here's everything.

809
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And then it goes into a trust on, like a
legal trust.

810
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
This is why I say like certain things
need to kind of be done off chain or else

811
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
there's no like legal backing for it.

812
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Cause who's to say I actually have to pay
gray, gray man, my house, if I default on

813
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,000
like the $250,000 of loan that he gave me.
