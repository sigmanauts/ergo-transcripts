00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hello everybody and welcome to a Redux of
the Ergo Classic AMA style.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
As some of you may know if you've been
paying attention to socials, we're kind of

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
changing up what we're doing. We're going
to guarantee the first of the month one of

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
these kind of style AMAs where we try to
have different people on like as you can

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
see today below me, we have Richie from
the USE coin project.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We have Joseph Arminio who needs no
introduction. And to my right, we have

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Batman. We have kushti right there in the
dark, doing the anon kind of style.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So we'll do that the first Wednesday,
first Thursday of every month. And then

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we'll leave the week after that for
flexible things. We've already been

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
discussing what we might do for next week.
And then for sure, we'll have the third

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
week Thursday, we're going to have the
classic community chat, community

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
discussion format, where we hopefully
don't get Zoom bombed too much, figure out

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
a better media, maybe it's spaces, maybe
it's not, we'll see.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And go from there and then wildcard again
for the fourth and if there's a fifth

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Thursday in the month then we'll see what
we can do and then hopefully Joe and I can

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
connect at 1 a.m. and do some late-night
dev updates or something in between to

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
fill some gaps so we'll see how that goes
but anyway with that aside welcome

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
everybody welcome Joe, kushti, Richie how
you guys doing?

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Doing pretty good. Hi, everyone. Yeah, so
busy days, but doing well overall. So our

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
USE launch was successful. Well, at least
what was done, done successfully. So I'm

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
currently pinging code for USE to run
off-chain bots from today. And from

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Saturday or Sunday, we are expecting a UI
launch. Maybe Richie can provide more

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
details, but yeah, I'm in touch with the
developers. So yeah, it will be available

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
to end users soon. So off-chain bots will
start to work today.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Well, why don't we have Richie jump right
in? Richie, tell us how the launch went.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You used MewFinance and how did all that
go?

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It went well. So the first idea came to
me probably two years ago. So I can talk a

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
little bit about it. So the idea is that
we have a lot of miners in Ergo that hold

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
their coins and they are not very
sophisticated in DeFi. So we have lots of

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
liquidity that is not used for purpose,
that kind of holds our network back.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Compared to other projects, we're not a
VC project. We don't have all these VCs

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
who pre-mine or allocate themselves all
the capital and then they can use it to

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
promote. So all our coins are fairly
distributed. So we have to kind of

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
activate our community, the power of the
community properly.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Now, while many of these guys are just
miners or some people who love the idea of

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
a fair launch cryptocurrency, they do not
necessarily understand how DeFi works.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
They maybe suffered some losses during
this meme coin mania or whatever. So most

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
of the people are kind of scared to use
their coin. They prefer to huddle for

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
years and then sell if the price pumps.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So now, because our project is fairly
launched, so there's no one, everyone

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
needs to understand, there's no one to
pump the price behind, right? So we need

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
to do it ourselves. We need to work
ourselves to get us where we deserve to

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
be, right? Maybe someone will jump along
the way, someone will notice and jump

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
along the way and decide like, you know,
massive capital and invest in Ergo, but

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
this is not guaranteed. So we need to work
ourselves on this way.

46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And basically, if someone wants to join
along the road, if he sees the potential,

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
of course, everyone is welcome in an open
ecosystem. But by default, if we just hold

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
what we've mined and don't do anything
with it, we might be where we are for

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
years, right? So that was my idea.

50
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And I was thinking how to create a
framework that allows us to use the

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
capital, the power of the community, but
then again, be very safe for people. So

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
with very clear assumptions, they're not
risking too much. It's a very low risk

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
project for investments, for contribution.

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So I put this idea of a CLB framework and
I submitted it during ErgoHack 9, I think

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
was it, and got in touch with MewFinance
guys who are very collaborative. So we had

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
some very good discussions and they came
up with their launch path, which was kind

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
of a little bit modified to meet CLB
requirements.

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And we came up with this idea of backing
up the stable coin, a new generation

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
stable coin that has lots of technologies
behind it to back it up with the community

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
money, basically, community funds. And as
you could see, it was quite a successful

61
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
launch. So we managed to get 395,000 ERG.
I don't think we in the history of Ergo,

62
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
we had any of that kind of launches or I
can't remember, right?

63
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So yeah, so what we do now, very clear
assumptions. Everyone knows 129 people

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
participated. The protocol is already
launched. So what we need is just UI and

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
some off-chain bots, and hopefully the
coin will be tradable by this weekend. And

66
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
after that, the idea is to expand, make it
cross-chain, go to other blockchains and

67
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
start offering them stablecoins.

68
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Stablecoins have very clear value. So
everyone knows how much is one dollar,

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
right? So you don't need to explain what
Ergo is and things like that. The idea is

70
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
to expand our dollar. And by expanding our
algorithmic dollar, naturally our TVL will

71
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
grow and people will come learn how bank
works, how liquidity pool works, and they

72
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
will learn about the chain itself.

73
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But even if they don't, they just simply
buy the stablecoin. For every stablecoin

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
bought, some ERGs will be going to the
bank, right? So like that, we are creating

75
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
revenue stream and some economics. So I
guess there will be many questions about

76
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
our plans and future. So this is the idea
to answer your first question. The idea

77
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
was to unlock the power of community and
unlock all the coins that have been

78
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
sitting pretty much doing nothing and put
them to work for Ergo, right? So, and I

79
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
think the first stage showed that it
worked pretty well.

80
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So what, Richie, and kushti, I guess,
what makes USE stablecoin different? I

81
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
understand that kushti was involved with
the concept of it or the building of that,

82
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the algorithms?

83
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, so the contracts, the idea was
mine. Well, mostly I discussed it with

84
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Bruno and so on. Then contracts were built
initially by Amitabh, rest in peace and

85
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
then I've extended them and I fixed some
things did tests and so on. Then we had

86
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Dexy Gold launch right and some tests but
Dexy Gold was launched by me so it was

87
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,000
highly experimental so I didn't want to
attract any money from outside, so just

88
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,000
put 1000 ERG into the bank, so it's small
scale.

89
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Now it's bigger, like a few times bigger.
A few K in the liquidity pool and like 3K

90
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
in the bank. So yeah, it's doing quite
well, you know, we had quite volatile

91
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
price movements, big volatility in recent
months but yeah it's doing well so the

92
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
bank is full and so on.

93
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So yeah well after watching our Dexy Gold
behavior in the free markets which we have

94
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
like sometimes absolutely free with no
insiders and so on, like in the case of

95
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Dexy Gold. So yeah, well, Richie proposed
to launch USD. And yeah, well, about fair

96
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,000
launch, so I think it is very much needed
to document the launch this time to avoid,

97
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
you know, some mythology to be appeared
later like happened with SigmaUSD to some

98
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,000
degree.

99
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I think it's quite unique kind of launch
for this so-called crypto industry. From

100
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:51,000
what I've seen, well, there were many
algorithmic stablecoins launched back in

101
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:01,000
2021-22. Often there were some crazy
stories when VCs and teams were involved.

102
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Sometimes they attracted liquidity by
selling $1 for 70 cents before the launch.

103
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:21,000
After the launch, it was depegged just
because early investors went out.

104
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So, yeah, well, a lot of crazy stories,
which you can find on the internet, some

105
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
of them, some maybe not so well documented
even. I think there is need to document

106
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
this effort of the community.

107
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, before we have this question that
we have up here, let's circle to Joe. Joe,

108
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
how do you see Rosen helping out with
spreading across ecosystems?

109
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's what Rosen is built for, to take
assets into new markets. I do think that

110
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
as we grow, we can expand, put them in new
environments, some of which have deep

111
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
liquidity already. You could look at a
Binance Smart Chain base as a future

112
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
option, and then you can also look at
emerging DeFi ecosystems, right?

113
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Or you may have chains that don't have
access to like the traditional stablecoin

114
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
value. And I think there could be huge
demand there as well because it's offering

115
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
a new product that they kind of need.
Stable value has a lot of, that's actually

116
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
probably been one of the best use cases of
crypto stable coins in terms of allowing

117
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
people around the world to access dollars
that potentially offers them more

118
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
stability and inflation resistance than
their own local currency.

119
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So I think around the world, it's like
400 million are using Tether, which is

120
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
pretty powerful.

121
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Are most stable coins chain dependent or
are they offering some sort of bridge

122
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
where there's shared liquidity on one
chain and it's spreading out to other

123
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
chains?

124
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah, you know, a lot of like the
traditional stable coins have like a

125
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
native implementation. But oftentimes what
happens is they have the same control

126
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
system, right? So, you know, they have the
ability to issue assets. They have the

127
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
ability to freeze assets. They have the
ability to seize assets in some cases.

128
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
There's even talk about, you know,
reversing transactions. So there's no need

129
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
for a bridge. They have, you know,
essentially, you know, God mode turned on.

130
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah. So they can, you know, balance
liquidity, move things around as they

131
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
want.

132
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But remind me, Joe, with Rosen Bridge, if
the core Rosen team was like, we hate

133
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
everything and we want to go away, people
could still utilize those smart contracts

134
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
as long as the watchers and the guards
were still doing their thing, right?

135
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
There's no central part. The guard set is
distributed enough that if all the Rosen

136
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
team disappeared, the guard would still
function. Now, you know, it's like, okay,

137
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
it'd be messy in terms of development. The
code is open source. It's there for a

138
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
reason. Our contribution standards have
been picked up by a couple of different

139
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
layer ones that are in different stages of
integration.

140
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Which is nice to see. Team has been kind
of putting together different test

141
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
environments and preparing, you know,
moving from theory to practice as always.

142
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You know, nothing kicks you in the teeth
like life, right? When you have great

143
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
ideas in your head. So we're preparing for
a contribution from external chains and

144
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
that's going to be a learning process
because it's the first time. But I assume

145
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
that once we get that process down, it'll
be, you know, less friction to bootstrap

146
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
every time. So I'm looking forward to
that.

147
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And I've seen some great questions from
the Firo team. Maybe there is need to

148
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,000
provide answers in public, right? So that
they were interested in guards, right? So

149
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,000
how hard to censor out certain chains,
right. Because it seems for them it's a

150
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,000
huge issue, right? So most of the
exchanges just throw them away for just

151
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,000
providing very basic human rights,
basically for financial privacy.

152
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yeah, Rosen was designed with that in
mind. You know, that's the one thing that

153
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
we want to do is distribute the guards in
terms of geographically, right? That way

154
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
any particular zone of control, you know,
guards could go offline, the bridge still

155
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
survives, right? There's no point in
having distributed infrastructure unless

156
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
you have that in mind for this type of
project.

157
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So we are globally distributed to where
we don't have enough footprint in any

158
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
single jurisdiction that if the guards
went offline, the bridge still operates.

159
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It is something that from Genesis we've
wanted to do, which is expand the guard

160
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
set. Now, it probably makes sense to do
that as a batch rather than a single

161
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
guard. So, you know, once we have
sufficient development and we're kind of

162
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
ready to take on that task, we want to
expand the guard set while keeping like

163
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
geographic distribution in mind and
ultimately harden the system, right?

164
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's really important for censorship
resistance because you can have like, you

165
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
know, multi-sig assumptions, that's just
one guy, right? That's not hard to do.

166
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But, you know, to have something that has
decent liveness guarantees and decent

167
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
censorship resistance that's actually
distributed across, you know, earth is a

168
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
different animal.

169
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Well, we got a question from Iron in
here. I'm going to pop it up here. It's a

170
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
question-ish, I think. I didn't have time
to read it real quick. Let's see. Curious,

171
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
it's about USE. Curious, other reserves,
non-metals, being shorter duration than

172
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
ERG would always net more term premium for
the base chain while not having different

173
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
fee structures, only duration, i.e. term
premium. That make sense to any of you

174
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
guys? You want to chime in on that?

175
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That was the question.

176
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'll read it again.

177
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I heard Richie and then my brain just
turned off.

178
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Byron's curious other reserves non-metals
being shorter duration than ERG would

179
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
always net more term premium for the base
chain while not having different fee

180
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
structures only duration ie term premium.

181
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's kind of hard, it's hard to predict,
right? I would say the one thing that

182
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
we're kind of running into in like the,
well, this year specifically is just

183
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
volatility, right? So, you know, we are
kind of entering this phase of, you know,

184
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I would say, mass fear of debt saturation.
And so we've seen gold, silver essentially

185
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
explode relative to how they normally
move. I think gold's at an all-time high.

186
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I think silver's at an all-time high.

187
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And then you have the tricky paper market
around both of those assets where they're

188
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
rehypothecated to hell, sometimes
overrepresented like 200, 300 to 1 based

189
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
on like physical versus paper. So those
are some crazy markets to consider in

190
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
terms of like what is possible if you know
people start to actually claim like

191
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
delivery, right?

192
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I have no idea. It's one of those things
where market making tricks and, you know,

193
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
rehypothecation which creates like
artificially inflated supply creates all

194
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
kinds of fuckery. So I've personally, you
know, even had like a silver Oracle built

195
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
actually for Rosen, because that was
something that in the long term I find

196
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
fascinating. I've kind of made the
decision that based on all the other stuff

197
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
that I'm juggling, it makes sense to sit
back and say, okay, well, you know, we

198
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
have USE, we have Dexy Gold, you know, we
have some, I believe there's like Jed's

199
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
shoe, which is some SigmaUSD variant
that's been proposed.

200
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It makes sense in my opinion to just be
conservative and watch, gather information

201
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and then make a choice. But that is
potential to have, let's say, other assets

202
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
in these frameworks. It's just
Oracle-dependent. But I do think that

203
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
being conservative is wise here. Sit down,
let them compete, gather real-world

204
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
testing information, and then we'll know
how to proceed.

205
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Richie, anything to add to that?

206
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So the idea of adding more derivatives
like silver, gold, well, gold we have is

207
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
appealing. But I think the way the markets
are built and it's not like my choice or

208
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
kushti's or Joe. So the people, for some
reason, they value the United States

209
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,000
dollar first. And if you even look at all
the stable coins that exist now in

210
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
circulation, the dollar dominates. It
dominates over everything.

211
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
If you look underneath, the structure
probably is fragile. It doesn't make sense

212
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
that the dollar has such a huge domination
and printing the trillions of debts. But

213
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
this is the reality, right? And the first
one, the most understood for everyone

214
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
currently is the dollar. So that's what I
kind of want to focus on by USE being the

215
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
first mover. But after that, yes, we can
definitely expand our lineup to precious

216
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
metals, maybe oil, maybe something else.
But it just makes sense to make dollar

217
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
first because it's the most understood and
widespread, right? It has the deepest

218
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
liquidity. But yes, definitely we're open
for other metals, other assets to be added

219
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
under the same scheme.

220
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Well, we got a kind of an off topic
question we can pop in here really

221
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
quickly. Let me bring this up. Bobcat is
looking about what your guys' thoughts are

222
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
on the Kachina protocol from midnight and
how it could work with Ergo or how we

223
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
could use it in Ergo or leverage it
essentially, or maybe even with USE or

224
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
that kind of stable crossing.

225
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah, I have no idea. All right. So yeah,
well, I read the paper like, five years

226
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
ago something like that so it's a paper
from like late 2010 so yeah well probably

227
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:16,000
makes sense then to review alternative
approaches like Aleo or dark DeFi and then

228
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:24,000
yeah provide a comparison right somehow. I
believe that there is some plan for that,

229
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:32,000
but I'm not sure when time can be found
for that.

230
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I think at some point there is a need to
consider the possibility for private

231
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
contracts, but there are a lot of
variables here. Well, the space is now

232
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
considering, well, mostly Ethereum
developers, not Bitcoin still,

233
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
post-quantum cryptography, right? And that
usually breaks everything we use in

234
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
regards with complex protocols and so on.

235
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So, yeah, well, I think maybe it's better
to build some basic tooling right and to

236
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:32,000
understand how can we build monetary
expansion to the real world and then yeah

237
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:43,000
consider privacy well also with
considering complications such as post

238
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:54,000
quantum security and so on, or maybe give
up. So it depends. It's still not very

239
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:05,000
good shape. It's still mostly uncharted
territory, I think.

240
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
All right, well, there's another question
in there, but we'll let that hold for a

241
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
sec. Sorry, go on, kushti.

242
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah, but maybe Richie can add, so he had
some thoughts about the need for private

243
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
DEXes and so on, yeah, expressed in some
chats. So, Richie, do you have some

244
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
thoughts on the need for private
contracts, private DEXes. So what's the

245
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
needs do markets have in your opinion?
Because well, we are here to enable free

246
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
markets, right? Well, digital markets.

247
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
The market definitely values the privacy.
And if it's possible to build a DEX,

248
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
leverage trading or stable coins that have
the privacy features, that will definitely

249
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
be appreciated by the market. Now, the
Kachina Protocol and Midnight kind of

250
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
trying to achieve this. I'm not the tech
person to understand it deeply to say

251
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
what's the trade-offs there.

252
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And looking at the roadmap that Midnight
is proposing, we're talking about some

253
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
smart contracts going live around Q3, I
think, next year. So we'll see how it

254
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
goes. The one thing that is clear to me,
if we connect to Midnight via Rosen, we

255
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
will definitely bring a stable coin there.
And if by getting to Midnight, it becomes

256
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
private, that will be already a big, quite
a big achievement. So you have algorithmic

257
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
stable coin on private chain. That sounds
like a very good combo to me. So while not

258
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
getting inside what Midnight plans about
their own technologies, I'm definitely a

259
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
big proponent of expanding Rosen to
support Midnight and expanding USE to

260
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
getting into that environment as well. Why
not?

261
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,000
All right, yeah, and I believe it is
about bringing tokens just, well, they USE

262
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
token right in the first place. So it
should be quite straightforward, right? So

263
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I believe they should provide some
primitives for that, for private tokens on

264
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
midnight.

265
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Yeah. I haven't looked into midnight in a
while, to be honest, just in other things.

266
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
But I do know at one point, I reviewed
documentation, but that was, that was a

267
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
while ago. So I'm no subject matter expert
there.

268
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yeah. So I need to refresh my knowledge
as well. But yeah, then it's, it would be

269
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,000
good to consider options, because so yeah,
bringing, algorithmic stable coins to

270
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
private environments. Yeah. It's a very
good combo indeed.

271
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
All right, let's see. We've got another
follow-up from Byron saying, the different

272
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
reserves support their own USE, like ADA
USE, ETH USE, making volatility contained

273
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
within each ecosystem's proof of support,
a basket of algorithmic stables rated by

274
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
open standards.

275
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Yeah, you know, I feel that, right, with
utilizing Rosen to spread stablecoin

276
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
across ecosystems, it feels like such a
crowdsourced version of something that

277
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
makes the management of it actually so
much easier in the long run, right? If you

278
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
have community-run liquidity pools popping
up on chains where it's needed that you

279
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
bridge to, then what do you have to do,
you know, as the creator of the project?

280
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Nothing, no, I guess. Richie? Seems a lot
easier to be able to sustain and manage

281
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
something like that.

282
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yeah, I can speak about my plans and how
I see our expansion and just ask me

283
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
questions and feel free to interrupt. So I
did some research and if you look at

284
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Uniswap v3 type of pools, now they have
Uniswap v4 but that's done mostly for

285
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
leverage trading so it has no benefit for
us. So, but Uniswap v3 is quite

286
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
interesting protocol and it's battle
tested already.

287
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So, obviously, we have it on PancakeSwap
and we will have it on Base as well. Now,

288
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:58,000
the cost efficiency of Uniswap v3, try to
guess. So, for example, Cardano and Ergo,

289
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
we are using typical AMM pools, right?
Straight AMM pools, Uniswap v2 type pools.

290
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But at a stable coin, it makes sense to
switch to Uniswap v3 and kind of select

291
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,000
the range, shorter range, and the
efficiency of the protocol goes 20x.

292
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So what does it mean? You need $1 million
worth of liquidity on a standard AMM pool,

293
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and you can replicate the same efficiency,
the same slippage, on Uniswap v3 with just

294
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
$50,000 of liquidity, right? So if we
create that liquidity pool USE to USDT

295
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
just with 50,000, for example, just as
arbitrary number, but on Uniswap v3 on

296
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
PancakeSwap, it's essentially the same as
getting a million dollar worth of

297
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
liquidity on AMM v2, or if you translate
it into ADA, like two and a half million

298
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
ADA.

299
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So if you look at the top ADA stable
coins now, their liquidity is between two

300
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
and I think six is the most. So we can
replicate the same depth and the same

301
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
basically quality and cost-efficiency for
the end user with just a fraction of it.

302
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So this is my next step. I already have in
my mind the program that we will launch

303
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
for the community, probably in one month's
time, to crowdsource the liquidity to

304
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
build AMM v3 type of pool on PancakeSwap.

305
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So with that one, we will have very
efficient rails to move stable coins

306
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:03,000
between USDT, USE, Ergo and Cardano. I
think everyone will be surprised with the

307
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:11,000
slippage tolerance and things like that.
That's what is in my mind over the next

308
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:19,000
one month, like I said. That's the primary
goal.

309
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And after that, we will plan to expand on
other chains, Cardano and maybe some

310
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
smaller chains that will join the Rosen.
But basically every chain will have a very

311
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
cost-efficient rails to move from USDT or
USDC back into USE and to their own chain,

312
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
just to the fraction of the cost. So with
that one, once deployed, obviously lots of

313
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
arbitrage traders will jump in because for
them cost efficiency is very important.

314
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And we will have quite a big volumes
moving and trading. So that's what I'm

315
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
hoping for, to enable that trading volume
in the next couple months with the help of

316
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
the community.

317
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,000
All right, so it's kind of arbitrage
friendly, right, stablecoin. And yeah, I

318
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,000
believe actually, well, in the crypto
industry, so stablecoins are mostly to

319
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,000
tame volatility, right, and do arbitrage,
actually, they're used for. Right. I am

320
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,000
not very proficient in trading. Is that
true?

321
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Yes, stable coins are used for arbitrage
trading mostly and they move to different

322
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,000
chains a lot and cost efficiency is very
important here. So like I said, the Rosen

323
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,000
enables cost-efficient implementation and
Pancake's Uniswap V3 type pools enable

324
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:08,000
very efficient trading. So we already have
these very efficient rails that we just

325
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
need to spread and then people will
naturally jump in as we expand.

326
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Well, nice. And also, it seems it will
enable Binance Smart Chain, right? So

327
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
currently, Rosen is still mostly about
Cardano, right? Bringing assets to Cardano

328
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
from going back. And yeah, so the plan is
to go for Binance Smart Chain in the first

329
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
place, right?

330
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Yes, Binance Smart Chain is the first
priority now because it has USDT. It has

331
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
very cost-efficient USDT. It's very
centralized, but that's what people want,

332
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
it seems. So they like USDT. And yeah, the
Binance Smart Chain enables that very

333
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
cost-efficient use of USDT. So the funds
should be flying back and forth to Ergo,

334
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Binance Chain, Cardano, and later to other
chains.

335
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
All right. What about Ethereum?

336
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Ethereum now is improving a little bit.
The cost of transactions on Ethereum was a

337
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
bit high. But with the recent updates, and
I just read yesterday that they're going

338
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
for another hard fork soon. So with that
update, the cost of using the Ethereum L1

339
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
goes down. At the moment, it will never be
as cost efficient as Binance Smart Chain

340
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
simply because it's a very centralized
chain.

341
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
But yes, I'll be monitoring that. So for
example, one year ago, it made no sense to

342
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
deploy on Ethereum because just the cost
of transaction was very high, but it's

343
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
getting better. So I'll keep monitoring
that and maybe we will enable it in future

344
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
if there will be a demand.

345
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Thanks. We've got another question here,
guys. And maybe it's for both kushti and

346
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Richie. What's the redundancy on the bots
that do the buybacks for the protocol? Any

347
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
of them running like on duck pools or only
one or two? I guess like Dexy too, right?

348
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Sorry. Can you repeat this?

349
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
What is the redundancy on the bots that
do the buybacks for the protocol, for the

350
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
USE protocol? Are any of them running like
on duck pools or only one or two?

351
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Yeah, so currently the code for off-chain
bots done by coder for USE is closed, but

352
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:02,000
he is promising to open source the bots
quickly after polishing the code. So yeah,

353
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:09,000
currently he's ashamed a bit of open
source, but yeah, after some polishing.

354
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And I think that there is needs to open
source UI also, right? And to have pools

355
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
on Ergodex and so on.

356
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So, and then wallets like Nautilus and
Ergo Wallet. And ErgoMixer actually, maybe

357
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Minotaur as well, not sure. So they all
have a feature to mint SigmaUSD, right? So

358
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:53,000
that should be an option, I believe, in
the long term also to get USE. Right.

359
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yeah, I do think that with the matching
of finance, with the grid ordering that

360
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:09,000
we're doing, it will be pretty powerful in
terms of like community arbitrage around

361
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:17,000
USE. Just because the amount of orders per
block potentially could really push a lot

362
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:25,000
of activity through the Ergo network just
in that one use case, arbitrage.

363
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Actually, I have a question to kushti
about data that Joe mentioned. kushti, so

364
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
when we have Machina Finance live, do you
think there is a possibility to add a

365
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
liquidity pool there that will be also
controlled by a bank? Is it somehow

366
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
possible to have two liquidity pools that
banks interact with? I know it sounds like

367
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,000
complicated, but the cost efficiency and
overall the whole structure of Machina

368
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Finance is very appealing to me.

369
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I think that will be a great DEX with the
presentation that Anand BR did during the

370
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Ergo anniversary, that looks like it will
be a very great asset to trade tokens on

371
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Ergo. So I was thinking if we can somehow
make a bank work with the DEX as well, in

372
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:34,000
addition to Ergodex that we're doing right
now, or maybe transfer liquidity somehow,

373
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:42,000
but something just theoretical, obviously
you don't need to answer right now fully.

374
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Well, to have two pools could be
complicated, so switching to another pool

375
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:01,000
may be easier. I think, conceptually even,
it makes sense to have one reference pool,

376
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:10,000
right? And then others will be equalized
with it. Yeah, arbitrage, right? So, and

377
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:19,000
with two pools, so the bank does need to
account for both somehow right and then to

378
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:28,000
intervene into both so yeah well a lot of
complexities here probably maybe even some

379
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:37,000
variants of Gresham's law I don't know.

380
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Possibly, yes, because, well, pools are
quite different, right? They're different

381
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
markets, after all, somehow. But you need
to think about it.

382
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Yeah, we will definitely think about it.

383
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Yeah, actually, very interesting. I would
discuss it with Bruno, I guess, next week.

384
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Yes, it's something to think about
because Machina by its design will enable

385
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,000
next level DeFi on Ergo. So just for
people listening here, Machina Finance

386
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
should allow us to match the liquidity
efficiency of Uniswap V3 type pools. So,

387
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
think about the efficiency of our current
pools, like Uniswap v2, that's what we

388
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,000
have on Ergo. And then with Machina, with
the grid orders, we will be able to set up

389
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
ranges. And it goes like 10x, 5x, 10x, it
depends on the trading pair. So for

390
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
stablecoin pairs, it makes a lot of sense
to trade them on Machina Finance. It

391
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
should be very novel. It's very
interesting. We'll see how it works. We're

392
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
still a few months away from it. But yes,
something I'm already thinking. It will be

393
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
a very beneficial development for Ergo
DeFi.

394
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,000
All right. Yeah, it's quite exciting,
right? So we can have concentrated

395
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,000
liquidity pools then, basically, just
without, well, liquidity pools, AMM ones,

396
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I mean, standard, like Uniswap. And that's
quite interesting. And yeah, that would be

397
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:40,000
useful for stable to stable, right? So
SigmaUSD to USE, for example, Glenn Gold

398
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:47,000
to Dexy Gold.

399
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Yeah, I kind of conceptualize that
anyway, in terms of extending people's

400
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
power from being their own bank to being
their own market maker, where they have

401
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
the ability to set these grids within
certain liquidity ranges and essentially

402
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
fulfill the purpose that market making
outfits do in terms of liquidity

403
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
management in and around spread. So
that'll be cool.

404
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And well, with Dexy design, where a bank
is slow to intervene, indeed, a lot of

405
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:39,000
possibilities for arbitrage rights with
other stable coins. And that's what helps

406
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:48,000
the bank as well. So the markets would
stabilize before the interventions,

407
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:57,000
mostly. It should be the case. And that's
quite interesting.

408
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
All right. Let's see. We've got another
hit from Ursa Minor 2010. Wants to know if

409
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
there's going to be, if there could be a
marketplace for the Ergo liquidity

410
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
provider, the LP tokens. Can you make
liquidity pools with LP tokens as part of

411
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
the pair? I'm wondering how abstract this
whole thing can get.

412
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
So the question is about creating markets
with liquidity pools.

413
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Yeah, creating a pair with liquidity
pools, markets, trading, arbitrage, all

414
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
that kind of stuff with the liquidity.

415
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Yeah, sorry, but you have LP token on one
side and on another side, you have what?

416
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I guess you'd put whatever you'd want the
pair to be, right? Whatever you would

417
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
speculate against in that manner.

418
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
kushti, I can take that.

419
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,000
So basically, CLB token that was
distributed to everyone is essentially

420
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,000
your LP token. So in two years, you will
be able to redeem CLB to liquidity tokens.

421
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
And then with the liquidity tokens, redeem
the liquidity from the main pool.

422
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So Ursa is saying SigmaUSD. I'd like to
make a pair with SigmaUSD, but sorry, go

423
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
on, Richie.

424
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
So currently, yes, we have CLB tokens
already tradable with ERGs, and they will

425
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
be tradable with USE on this weekend or
whenever the UI goes live. And that's

426
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
essentially you are trading your liquidity
pool tokens with ERG or with stablecoin.

427
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
So what he says is, yes, it is possible,
but it's much better representation when

428
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,000
it's like a derivative of it. So a CLB
token is essentially a liquidity token and

429
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
you can trade it even now. It can go now
to any of our DEXes and then buy or sell

430
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
CLB tokens. And that's essentially buying
or selling a liquidity token.

431
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,000
You cannot redeem it yet, because that's
the whole idea, to keep that liquidity

432
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,000
working for the ecosystem for two years.
But you can trade it.

433
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Where is it now? It looks like the LP is
in about 10 wallets or so. Richie? Sorry?

434
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,000
That token? I'm looking at its contents
right now. CLB?

435
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
No. Whatever that LP token, you've
created the LP token already?

436
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Yes, the LP token is created on the CLB
launch pool, so it will be transferred to

437
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,000
a smart contract and will be locked there.
We'll see how much time it takes to create

438
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:59,000
the smart contract, the redeem smart
contract. If it will take a little bit

439
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:05,000
longer, then we will just transfer it to
Rosen for storage for two years. And then

440
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,000
after that, to Rosen Cold Wallet, Multisig
Cold Wallet.

441
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And then from there, we will transfer it
to a smart contract with a time lock until

442
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
December 1st, 2027. And then when December
1, 2027 comes, you will be able to use CLB

443
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
tokens to redeem your liquidity tokens. I
hope that makes sense with what I'm

444
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
saying.

445
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Yeah, it does. Great.

446
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
All right, let's see what else we have. I
don't see any other questions unless we've

447
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
missed some. What about any other news in
the ecosystem? Well, we have 10 minutes

448
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
left, guys. kushti, what you been working
on? Joe, you didn't talk. You're muted,

449
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Joe. But what about your runes?

450
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
That's been kind of... Yeah, we have a
lot of news, so 10 minutes not enough

451
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
probably. But yeah, we can take another
five. And yeah, Joe, please go ahead.

452
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Sure. So let's start with Runes. Rosen
Runes did go live, which means we can now

453
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
wrap assets onto Bitcoin, which is really
unique. Now we're kind of looking across

454
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
the Bitcoin DeFi space and I've got to say
it's pretty rough in terms of like the

455
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
shallow limits of it.

456
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
So we're, we're actually have our own
little thinking group in terms of like

457
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
interactive transaction construction,
which is basically where you use partially

458
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
signed signatures and then off chain logic
to coordinate more complex swaps. Kind of

459
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
like a, I don't know. I don't know what
you call it. It's like an atomic swap on

460
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
the same chain with off-chain conditions
that you're agreeing on or coming to

461
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
consensus on is the net goal.

462
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So, or actually... How do you enforce
those off-chain?

463
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Well, you have to use partially signed
transactions, essentially. That's a

464
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:11,000
working group theory that we're playing
with right now, which is kind of fun.

465
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,000
We are going to support a protocol called
Ducat protocol, which is somewhat of a

466
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,000
MakerDAO style protocol, stablecoin on
bitcoin itself that's going to be backed

467
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
by bitcoin layer one liquidity i think
they're going to launch next year and so i

468
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,000
do think it's quite interesting if we can
scrap together some sort of amm design you

469
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
know we can potentially get stablecoin to
stablecoin pairs on bitcoin you know who

470
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
knows maybe one of these days they'll drop
something like BIP 119 and we'll get

471
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
covenants and then all of that will be
wasted time.

472
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,000
But Bitcoin is incredibly slow to evolve.
So maybe that's like due 2040. Let's see.

473
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,000
In terms of Lithos, we've launched the
test net. That's been really going quite

474
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,000
well so far. It's been nice to see that in
like a dynamic testing environment. You

475
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
know, they've been catching bugs, that
have been coming up. It's been a really

476
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,000
good stress test because right now on
testnet that Lithos is the king.

477
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I've never had so many people mining. I'm
mining test net with a 3090 using mining

478
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
core. And I haven't gotten a block in like
days, Joe. It's quite competitive.

479
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
No, it's been awesome. And it's one of
those things where, in testnet right now,

480
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
we actually are seeing a scenario where
Lithos actually has the majority of hash

481
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
rate in the framework. But you still have
a distribution of blocks to people, unique

482
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
miners, which is the ideal outcome for
Lithos, is to be able to spread those

483
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
block producers.

484
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Today, we did have kind of a big event,
which because we're on testnet, nobody's

485
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
really lying about their nisps, the amount
of work that they're trying to submit, and

486
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
they're just running the base client, and
the base client is more or less following

487
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
its own logic. Quote unquote, honest. So
we've started lying on testnet. And today,

488
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
the first fraud proof that caught a
misrepresentation of work worked and it

489
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
slashed us.

490
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,000
How much did you put up for the slash? Is
that the same cost as the block reward?

491
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Yeah, so essentially, when you have
miners that are running fraud proofs, when

492
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
you reduce somebody's submitted share,
they get paid less and you get paid more.

493
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
So there is a nice natural incentive there
to audit other miners, because if you

494
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
catch something, you benefit from slashing
them or slashing their share that they

495
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
submitted.

496
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
So that's kind of the game theory in
terms of like, why would people want

497
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
redundantly, you know, auditing the work
of other people because they get paid more

498
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
when they catch something, right? So that
does kind of spread horizontally across

499
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
all the actors. You know, we still have
more work to do in terms of the test net,

500
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
but overall things are going really well.

501
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
We're going to get another update, you
know, probably in a couple of days,

502
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
getting the collateral system working
properly again, along with the client's

503
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
API, but things are chugging along and
testnet is its own beast. It's pretty

504
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
cool.

505
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
You guys have drained me dry of ERGs for
collateral. If anybody has any ERGs that

506
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
is running the Lithos, please just send
them to cheese because I'm all out. I

507
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
think I have 2000 testnet ERGs left and
I'm not getting any more because Lithos

508
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
has beaten me on the block discovery.

509
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Yeah. If you have any extra sentiment, DM
cheese and send it with cheese.

510
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:19,000
It's been really cool to see that type of
participation on test net. So hats off to

511
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,000
the community. We are putting together,
like a airdrop thing, for people that have

512
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,000
mined the test net or, you know, maybe
even a little bonus for people that are

513
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,000
able to slash our fraud and that we're
putting on the network.

514
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
But yeah, that type of community
engagement is, is really awesome to see.

515
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Looking forward to rolling this thing out
and hopefully, you know, getting the

516
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
March, the test night underway or main
net, excuse me.

517
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I'm impressed, Joe. It's been, it's,
Lithos has been a word on people's lips

518
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
for a long time and now just plus two plus
years. And now it just pumps right out.

519
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Cheese has been sitting there working in
the background for quite a while.

520
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:14,000
All right. Will we see a paper behind
Lithos design?

521
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I hope so. All right. I think it would
make sense to put together some sort of

522
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
white paper. I do think it's funny how we
have a tendency on Ergo to build it first

523
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
and then like, oh, we need to build it. I
don't even think there's a Rosen white

524
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
paper yet, to be honest. I have to check.
I think someone was going to make

525
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
something.

526
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Yeah, well, I think you need now to
document and sell it, right? So a lot of

527
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,000
coding and well, it's time to sell the
tools, right? And the whole story, I

528
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:55,000
believe.

529
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:04,000
About the papers, we've got a bunch of
papers accepted for the first stability

530
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:13,000
workshop which will take place in Jaipur
city, India on December 15th. I will

531
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:22,000
present the chain cache paper there. Also
Luca will present Dexy paper and Bruno

532
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:31,000
with different co-authors including Luca
will present also a few papers.

533
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
So maybe we can do our next AMA from
India then me Bruno and Luca but then yeah

534
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I'm not sure about Thursday actually maybe
Friday or Saturday.

535
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Yeah, that's the beauty of the middle
weeks. kushti, we can be really flexible

536
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
with it. So, yeah, just keep us posted.

537
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yeah, and I think it would be nice,
right, to have some, like, bleeding edge

538
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:11,000
research. After all, for the first time
after, I don't know, maybe years. Then,

539
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:20,000
yeah, I'm testing basis tracker right now
and then also thinking to jump on doing

540
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:29,000
presentations, right, marketing materials.

541
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Then there is a bunch of community-made
writings I need to review, such as Silver

542
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Sense by Greiman. So I did some reviews
and yeah, well, with basis tracker

543
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:54,000
available, there is need to finalize it in
some implementable form, let's say, right,

544
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:02,000
and then do some real-world experiments.

545
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Then there are some other ideas. So there
is this forum post by Federico, I need to

546
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:17,000
check about this common currency,
commonwealth currency, how's it called, so

547
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:24,000
yeah we'll check and probably provide some
review also testing the forum which got

548
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:31,000
migrated to a new location, right, a lot
of news.

549
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Then yeah we have a new version of
Minotaur wallet and update for Ergo Wallet

550
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:44,000
is also done and under testing now. So now
it's time to consider publishing details

551
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,000
for Ergo Wallet and I think it's a good
time to start publishing Minotaur as well.

552
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:56,000
So we need to figure out details.

553
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Then what? Yeah, my father too or at
least sub-blocks white paper. So the

554
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:17,000
initial plan was about the next week, the
plan which I had right after the release

555
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:26,000
launch. But with this trip to India, Bruno
also invited me to give a short talk at

556
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:35,000
the beginning of the hackathon, which will
be from December 13th, so before the main

557
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:44,000
event.

558
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:54,000
So on, well, I'm currently not sure about
next week, but yeah, well, it's close and

559
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:03,000
we will start another DevNet. So I
actually tested it before the USE

560
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:12,000
deployment with a couple of mining peers
of mine and now, well, it's time for more

561
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:21,000
broad testing. It will be started in a few
days. Yeah, what else?

562
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Just a shout out to, guys, shout out to
Bez who's been cranking out a massive

563
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
amount of community pages here. He's got
ergoblockchain.org. He's got the app built

564
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
on ergo theme, right, that he's cranking
out. Fantastic artwork, fantastic amount

565
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
of content there as well.

566
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:49,000
It's the new community hub and it has a
marketing section for you guys so there

567
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:57,000
you can find a lot of fun pages which you
can distribute around. Then there were a

568
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:05,000
lot of updates reported during yesterday's
DevChats for Hermes. And yeah, we also

569
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:13,000
have Digin's World, so QX, maybe it's your
turn to present.

570
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
No, no, I haven't. Have you played with
Digin? You know, I haven't. I haven't

571
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
played with it much. I tried to build
something really quickly and then

572
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
something else. But that's Rob, right?
That's Lithos Rob?

573
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Are they doing it? Yeah, so yeah, it's
Rob and yeah, they have a lot of good meme

574
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:45,000
NFTs already.

575
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Yeah, but somebody built a really
beautiful 3D block explorer essentially

576
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
and kind of like a nice visual where you
click on a floating block and you get the

577
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
stars moving by you and then all the block
information shows up to your right and you

578
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
can slide through the blocks. It's really
awesome what you can do with this.

579
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I think he's using Gemini for that, for
the coding, which the new version is a

580
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
really, really does a really nice job at
that kind of stuff. So if you guys haven't

581
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
checked it out, please check it out. I'll
try to repost something on Twitter today

582
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
so you can get the link again. But really,
really cool site that he made to be able

583
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
to put coding in the hands of non-coders.

584
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Yeah, I'm also playing with AI coding
contracts, so we discussed some things

585
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:45,000
with Rob and I used an agent to review
Dexy contracts also during the USE

586
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:53,000
deployment. So along with manual recheck
of like everything here that there was an

587
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:01,000
agent, coding agents also working on that
along with tests.

588
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:07,000
First of all, Bez wants to know if we
need to solidify the Mexico trip. Is that

589
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:13,000
something? Did you talk to, who was it,
Anon or Allison? Or anybody else? MX. MX,

590
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:19,000
yeah, yeah, yeah.

591
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:28,000
All right. So let me check with the guys
how big it will be. So a few years ago,

592
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:36,000
there were friends from pirate chain
joining the event they offered to share

593
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:44,000
booth even but yeah now they're not
appearing there it seems so yeah need to

594
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:52,000
think with them if loot from pirate is
coming that would be great as well because

595
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:00,000
they have experience with this event but
yeah let's go why not so it will be late

596
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:08,000
February somewhat second half of February
Acapulco city in Mexico Anarcopulco

597
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:16,000
conference and so maybe we can show

598
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I know, so some things there like mesh
networks based basis powered peer-to-peer

599
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:29,000
cache for like community trading,
something like that. All right, and QX,

600
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:35,000
any updates for BRIC experiment?

601
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Oh yeah, we're going full... It's ready
for... I actually wrote Louis Vacher the

602
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
other day, and I was like, Louis, I just
want to thank you for Tipperbot and having

603
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
a tool that allowed us to introduce BRIC
in a really easy way for micro payments.

604
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,000
But I'm going to move off Tipperbot fully.
I'm going to sever everybody's Tipperbot

605
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
wallet. I'm going to actually pull it from
the Discord. I can't sever their wallets.

606
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
And then give them instructions on how to
convert to Nautilus and bring the seed

607
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
phrase over.

608
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
But the portal is fully built for them.
And there's a new method, too, that we're

609
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
going to distribute. So the idea is that
at least administration here, we don't

610
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,000
want to reward things that students should
be doing. So if we want to reward students

611
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
with BRIC for showing up to class and
scanning and check-in-ing, that's

612
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
something they should be doing. We don't
want to reward them for that.

613
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
So there's very kind of unique cases that
we're going to reward them for. And the

614
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
latest case that we're going to reward
them for is we have a huge issue in our

615
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
physical woodworking shops and machining
shops where students aren't checking in

616
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
with the QR codes with the third party
program called Fabman when they go to the

617
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
shop.

618
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
So a shop technician can't know without
walking through the shop every time

619
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
exactly what the capacity of the shop is
and how many people are in there because

620
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
people aren't checking in. So what I've
been doing with the portal is I've

621
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
integrated the API for that third-party
software in. Every day, it pulls that

622
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
third-party software to get people to
check in. And then in the back end, I

623
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
already have it made. We can hit a button,
and it builds a transaction and sends BRIC

624
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
to every single student that checked in
that day or that week if it builds up kind

625
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,000
of thing.

626
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
So that's the second to latest thing that
we've done. And the latest thing that

627
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,000
we've done is we want places to be able to
spend this BRIC too, right? We want an

628
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,000
economy. So what we're doing is I've
already built into the portal as well.

629
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Students can send their BRIC to a wallet
through the portal with Nautilus and then

630
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,000
once a month when the 3D printer shop you
know with the 3D printers are charging

631
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:50,000
students for the filament that they used
through the 3D printer OS application we

632
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
take the export from the 3D printer OS
application they wouldn't give me API

633
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,000
access kind of pissed me off but whatever
we take that excel export I dump it into

634
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,000
my portal and I then subtract the BRIC
that the students have given to the portal

635
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:10,000
from their portal so if you've donated you
know 50 BRIC that's what that's about

636
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,000
that's about seven dollars six bucks so if
you donate six bucks to the portal then

637
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,000
we're only going to bill you what your 3d
printer cost was minus six bucks

638
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
So it's a way to get that BRIC
circulating back into us that we can then

639
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
distribute back out for checking in so
that's the latest thing that we're doing

640
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
which is super super cool and next
semester will be the full-on launch of hey

641
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
everybody we've severed discord for tipper
bot you're all on nautilus now go to the

642
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
portal and do it so yeah the portal

643
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I mean, that's what I love about Ergo.
With AI and how easy Ergo is to use, it

644
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,000
took no time at all to integrate Fleet SDK
into just normal JavaScript calls and my

645
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
programming that I use to write websites.
And it's just like Tipperbot. If a

646
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,000
student, if I'm going to transfer a BRIC
to a student or another student wants to

647
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
transfer a BRIC to a student through the
portal, they type in the net ID, they hit

648
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
send. If the student doesn't exist in the
portal, it builds a wallet for them

649
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
automatically and then sends that to
Nautilus so the person can complete the

650
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
transaction to send the transaction.

651
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
But it's wicked cool. I'm really excited
about it. And as this builds and builds,

652
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
hopefully we have more use cases to give
out BRIC and more use cases to suck BRIC

653
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,000
back in as well. So yeah, so that's the
BRIC update for the day.

654
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Nice. And do you document experiments,
like maybe not even technical side, but

655
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
social and socioeconomic interactions?

656
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
No, I don't. Glasgow had a nice write-up
that he surveyed and got everything pretty

657
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
right, at least in the initial setup and
set. You're right I mean I'd love to be

658
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,000
able to what I'd love in the future and
maybe a year or two down the road when we

659
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,000
get a real big economy going with BRIC
here and it's swapping through everything

660
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I'd like to see like third party places
like let's say students want to, you know,

661
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,000
students usually buy lumber from 76th
Lumber down the road, right?

662
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
How awesome would it be if 76 came to us
and said we want, you know, to, or we went

663
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
to them and said, you know, could we have
students drop off BRIC and every BRIC you

664
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
hand us back will give you six cents for
right there kind of thing. So that'd be

665
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
ideal to have it start spreading outside
of the local economy in that manner for

666
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
merchants that want our students'
business.

667
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Yeah, I think possible.

668
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I think so, too. I think so, too, for
sure.

669
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
All right, guys, we're 11 minutes over.

670
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:55,000
This is great. All right. Yeah. So there
are more updates, but yeah, let's wrap up

671
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:01,000
with that. Already quite solid. I believe
free stuff updates. So, yes. See you.

672
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Yeah. Thanks everybody. Thanks Richie for
coming, talking about USE, Joe for USE and

673
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Rosen, kushti for USE and everything else
on your mind. Thanks so much.

674
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Have a good one. Take care. Bye.
