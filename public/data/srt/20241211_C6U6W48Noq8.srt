1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
presentation.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm pretty excited about it.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is Mining Rights Protocol.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And so what is MRP or Mining Rights
Protocol?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's a mineral rights inspired system for
blockchain mining.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's a rights-based token distribution
mechanism, has an NFT enhanced mining

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
privileges, and allows for sustainable
token emission as a protocol.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And so it kind of in short is essentially
what we're doing, we are minting tokens.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And these set of tokens are going to be
our rights tokens.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And so we can have five of these rights
tokens.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We can have 10, have 20, we have 10
million.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
These would be sort of, I guess, akin to
specific GPUs.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And then we have the actual admission
token, which would be akin to ERG.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And so basically what we're doing is you
buy the rights tokens and then that gives

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
you the right to then run a block and to
be able to emit the given token.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So we can say maybe the token here is
MRP.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So say, for example, we have 10,000
rights tokens.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and you buy one, you can then buy or
rather emit the MRP token as long as

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
you're mining.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And so again, you have to be mining.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is essentially a mining protocol
kind of on top of the Ergo blockchain and

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
allows for sort of dual rewards.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And so what we're doing there
specifically is going to be proving that

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the miner did find the given block.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We can take a look on the chain, like
which miner found it, look at an explorer.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, they did find it.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Great.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And then from there, they can claim that
token.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And so kind of looking at the specifics
more closely, we'll have two proxy

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
contracts.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We'll have the rights token and then the
MRP token or an NFT token to be able to

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
emit it from.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And so we'll put in all of the TX fees
that we need or even protocol fees.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Because this whole thing can be sort of
gamified like traditional other things.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But it might make sense for a given
protocol to pay people who run bots that

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
maybe just aren't miners.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So then they get a little bit of reward.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's awesome from them, but they're
also keeping the protocol.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The emissions essentially running.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Aside from like you or a couple other
people.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So more incentives.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So just like with GPU purchases, you want
to say, hey, can I buy this GPU?

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Can I buy the rights?

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Fantastic, you do buy the rights and then
from here we can have an NFT bonus that's

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
maybe a commemorative bonus or maybe they
buy so much or within the first 100 XYZ

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
they get a lifetime of 1.2X rewards.
Again, could be gamified, could just be a

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
receipt.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
From there, we want to check, does the
miner have the rights?

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, look, they do have the rights.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Fantastic.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Did they find a block?

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
They did find a block.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Fantastic.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's make a claim.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Now that we made a claim, is it a valid
claim?

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It is a valid claim.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We can then dispense the MRP token or we
can generate an NFT based upon parameters

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
at that given time.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So like block height, the size of the
block, things like that.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And then this is the entire sort of
action flow from this perspective.

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And then quickly moving along, we're
looking at our technical requirements.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So what is this, what was, what is it
gonna take for users to set this up?

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So we'll have a user interface for the
protocol owner to set these tokens up with

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
the specific details and that sort of
criteria.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
From there, we are going to also have
distribution bots.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Those distribution bots will use Ergo
nodes to facilitate the smart contract

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
layer that we're facilitating here.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And then that's essentially it.

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So the user is going to access the
dashboard.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
They're going to request status and say,
hey, what's going on?

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
All right, we're back.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And so just to kind of wrap up this
section, we'll have various GitHub repos

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
to sort of show how to do this, maybe even
some sites that are running this, and

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
it'll be really, really easy.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I have prototypes of this specific setup
right here, and it works great.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Super easy to run, and all in Python.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So here's our protocol owner UI sample we
have right here.

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And so we can kind of see, from top to
bottom, total number of NFTs, tokens, the

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
distribution pattern, rights token price
per ERG.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Everything will probably add some more
here, because this is sort of a prototype.

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We have some details right here.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
How much it's going to cost to fund all
this.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And so thank goodness it only cost 0.001
ERG per TX and so we're going to need that

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
by the total number of tokens divided by
the distribution amount.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And so we need to have enough inside the
boxes to be able to emit.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And so the owner, they're going to create
the token.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
They're going to set up the initial sale.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
They have the rights distribution next,
and then the protocol management.

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And so that's just collecting the fees.

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The reserve management in this case so
they're going to reserve for some reason

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
2500 but again the gamification you don't
have to do that you can do whatever you

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
want.

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Adjust the parameters.

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Not actively.

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But set the parameters and kind of go
more of a thing.

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Because once it's in the emission
contract, you can't change it.

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Initially, on testnet, we do have some
things to be built in that whoever owns

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
the protocol can spend the boxes.

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's getting your money back.

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But obviously, we'll take that out on
mainnet.

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So people don't rug.

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And so then we have the rights holder
experience.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So they can purchase rights.

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
They can have a minimum of one token, say
max.

105
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Again, max.

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You don't have to.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You can do NFT bonuses.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The mining operation will have the block
discovery, the reward claims, and then the

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
collection of the token or NFT.

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And then we can even do staking, things
like that.

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Again, a bunch of different options.

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
From here, we have the bot
infrastructure.

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So it's gonna do the real-time block
scanning.

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And then users can set this up to be like
every minute, every... And so there is

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
incentive to say, to have really good
software to be, if you're gonna be the one

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
say collecting most of these.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Or have multiple bots set up because
there's baked in the protocol for you to

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
get say the MRP token.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But they're going to do the rights
verification and then calculate the

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
rewards.

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
This is the distribution system
effectively of the emission tokens.

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Instead of mining, we're running these
bots.

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Instead of GPUs, we're buying and selling
rights tokens.

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's like a synthetic GPU mining system.

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So this could be an initial release.

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I am playing around with the idea of
launching one of these, but this is a

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
sample for 10 years.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And so we can see how much of the token
supply is emitted over 10 years.

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We can see the yearly emission rate on
both plots here.

130
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's pretty easy to see.

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Because we have the halving sort of
happen.

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So we have 100 and 50 to 25, the half of
25.

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And then here kind of wrapping up again
this is more of a white paper, but we do

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
have some prototypes.

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I've been moving across the country so
didn't have a lot of time to code as one

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
would imagine, but kind of a roadmap here
is to start and build and continue to

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
build on this foundation that we have.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And that foundation is a system that
generates tokens very similarly to our

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
emission token, say MRP.

140
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And then from there, it is dispensed to a
set of users, hard-coded at this point,

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
but distributed at those users, like, say,
one every block, or every other block,

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
rather.

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And then does that until the box is
empty.

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And then again, I'm running various bots
to facilitate this.

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So we do have prototypes, that stuff does
work.

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And then we can start to slowly
transition over to this sort of core

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
protocol we're calling.

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And then once you hit that core protocol,
continue testing on testnet, validate sort

149
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
of the boxes, try to attack it, see if I
can spend these boxes and make sure that

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
the Sigma prop is accurate for what we're
actually trying to launch here.

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And then maybe we're gonna launch the
actual tool set, sort of an SDK, so to

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
speak, and then we can actually launch a
specific token.

153
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And then from there, I want to move into
this NFT system to where this could be

154
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
utilized, for example, for token minting.

155
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is an alternative to token minting
and then puts the tokens, I'm sorry, NFT

156
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
minting, NFT minting into the hands of the
miners and miners can do whatever they

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
want or even the pool operators.

158
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Maybe we would do something for this for
the Sigmanauts mining pool.

159
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But the idea would be to buy a rights
token or essentially the rights to buy an

160
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
NFT or however many NFTs and maybe there's
like say a limit like 10k there's 5k

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
there's a thousand.

162
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And then per one, you'll get a specific
NFT, but only when a given miner finds the

163
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
block.

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So then we're using this sort of mining
randomness whenever they're going to find

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
a block to then mint a NFT.

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And then that could go to some sort of
marketplace like MewMart.

167
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And then the last sort of step I would
like to do.

168
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And maybe we'll wait to launch a token
once we have all of this but some sort of

169
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
staking opportunity because it would be
really interesting to be able to have

170
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
rights to these tokens and then be able to
stake these tokens for other rewards in

171
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
sort of a synthetic sort of GPU mining
environment but maybe it doesn't make

172
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
sense and I'd be curious what the feedback
we get for this because maybe there's

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
something that I'm not really thinking
about and might not be a good idea.

174
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And then, of course, partnership with the
communities and then governance, if this

175
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
continues to take off, especially if we
launch a given token, we'll probably have

176
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
a Paideia kind of DAO and use that.

177
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So let me know what everybody thinks.

178
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
We're excited to submit this and see what
happens.
