1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
All right, here we go, fellas.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Welcome.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Mark, good to see you.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Wade, thanks for coming on, man.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Thanks, guys. Yeah, good to talk to you.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, for sure. So I'm just now meeting
you, Wade. My name's Tim. People in Ergo

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
know me as tmr.erg. And I've been here for
like maybe three years now. I'm kind of

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
following along. I am relatively new to
crypto. I don't really have a background

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
in it. My background is in education. I
grew up in a rural place, so I didn't have

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
exposure to a lot of tech. But I was
generally good at math and stuff. And so

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
as I got older, I'm fine. I can manage.
But I'm not an expert, not a coder,

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
nothing like that. But yeah, I stumbled
into this community and just thought it

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
really lined up with my values and then
met Mark and me and Mark get along. So we

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
started doing this, I guess, several
months ago now. So I'm curious, what is

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
your background and your relation to
technology and finance? How'd you end up

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
talking to us?

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, so I've had actually a pretty early
exposure to crypto. Hold on one second,

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll close the door and we can start that
over.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So my background actually comes from I
went to a magnet program with technical

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:40,000
aspects to it. I can definitely talk about
that at some point too in the future on

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:03:05,000
this, but the program I went to was the
Center for Advanced Technology. You can

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:30,000
look that up and you can find out where
that is, and I still live down the street

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:55,000
from them.

24
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
All right, here we go, guys. Deep breath.
All right, so I went to a pretty technical

25
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
high school called the Center for Advanced
Technology where we were learning computer

26
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
programming, a lot of math and science
classes at that point in time too. And

27
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
that was actually my first exposure to
cryptocurrency. And I heard about Bitcoin

28
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
in the early 2010s. Oh, wow. Because I
have programming friends and programming

29
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
classes that they were all a bunch of
nerds on the edge of tech in a lot of

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
ways. We were pirating sites with music
and things like that were very prevalent

31
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
in that period of time. File sharing, the
whole school had networks with computers

32
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
in the classroom. I think before that was
a lot more prevalent in schools nowadays

33
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
with individual logins connected to LAN.
And so I was exposed to that type of stuff

34
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
from an early age, and I've always really
been fascinated by computers and

35
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
technologies, to be honest, and I've built
a couple computers over my life since

36
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
then. I think from that experience on,
though, it was something I kind of put in

37
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
the back of my head as something that
still seemed pretty niche to me, or at

38
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
least didn't click along with the people
that I was hanging out with, the things

39
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
that I was involved with, like sports. So
I almost dismissed it for probably a very

40
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
long time. Since that point, going through
college and focusing on more production

41
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
related sides of technology and media. And
I've continued that through my career

42
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
right now with my business. And I've
always talked about with friends different

43
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
types of cryptocurrencies and I've
probably traded a little bit on Robinhood

44
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
just for fun, never holding anything
seriously. But again, I've been more

45
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
interested in, through college I got a
business degree, so definitely interested

46
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
in finance and the workings of a business
and all those types of things that go

47
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
along with that. So I've had a lot of
traditional investments through that

48
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
period of time, individual stocks, IRA
plans, things like that. And I've just

49
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
been pretty conservative focusing on those
aspects, but still always interested in

50
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
the technology of crypto and maybe some of
the future use cases of it, but still kind

51
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
of discovering more for my personal risk
tolerance. And besides that, the true

52
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
utility of it in a lot of ways.

53
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, I think that's important whenever
you think about crypto as an investment.

54
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's like if you're already set and you're
already going to retire and you have a

55
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
plan, like it's fine to be conservative.
Like you don't have to just roll all your

56
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
money into Bitcoin. Like that's not
responsible. And I mean, I'm the same way,

57
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
it's like I evaluated my own risk
tolerance and allocated accordingly and

58
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
just like I'm not going to over invest in
something that I don't control. So totally

59
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
get it. And that's something I tell
people. It's like, yeah, okay, if you're

60
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
already retired, like you don't need to
invest in Bitcoin. But if you don't want

61
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
to, it's fine.

62
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah, absolutely. But even now, so in
current times, Bitcoin seems like still

63
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
the most flourishing, most popular, most
gains to be had in crypto in this way too.

64
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So I know there's a lot of subsets that
you guys know better about than I do in

65
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
the world, but I think my knowledge kind
of stops at like the first couple highest

66
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
market caps in crypto. And then besides
that, I think my knowledge drops off

67
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
pretty fast of what's available out there
and the differences between each of those

68
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
blockchains and coins and stuff.

69
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah. So Mark, what about you, dude?
When's the first time you heard of crypto

70
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
or blockchain or Bitcoin?

71
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I would say probably around like 2018.
That's when I first bought Bitcoin. I was

72
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
actually just looking the other day. I'm
like, how much Bitcoin in my lifetime have

73
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I ever bought? Just to have that sort of
FOMO, right? And it was nothing crazy. But

74
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
yeah, I would say actually, though,
thinking about it 2016, maybe 15, someone

75
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
was mentioning how they're mining
Ethereum. I'm like, what? This is weird.

76
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Like, you got a GPU. And at that point, I
was just so focused just in my life and

77
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
all that sort of stuff didn't really give
it any sort of glimpse or look. But I have

78
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
a background in, I guess, mechanical
engineering and then software engineering.

79
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And so kind of going through life, one
thing led to another in terms of

80
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
entrepreneurial type of ideas, built my
own computer similar to Wade, and then all

81
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
of a sudden I could find out, hey, I can
use my GPUs to mine. From an investment

82
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
perspective, my parents come from real
estate. And so my dad was always kind of

83
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
instilling that idea of just like, you
need to buy assets instead of leaving it

84
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
in the dollar. And so but on that same
token, I don't really like the idea of

85
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
working with tenants and things like that.
And so that's where crypto and even stocks

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
where I kind of come to play in my
mindset, or even mining. And so instead of

87
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
buying a stock or crypto, I can buy the
asset that is the GPU miner. And then from

88
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
there, I can continually rely on it on a
reward more indefinitely for the most

89
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
part. So that's kind of, I guess, my story
there.

90
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah, that's cool, man. I, I guess, for
me, probably like 2012, I heard about

91
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Bitcoin. And I remember like a really
specific conversation with my mom. Like I

92
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
came home from college, just visiting and
like, hey, I heard about this thing. I

93
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
didn't understand it. I was like, it's
like money for your computer and you like

94
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
use energy to get it. And I didn't like,
didn't click, didn't understand. And then

95
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I just like blanked it out for a huge
portion for like the next nine years or

96
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
something. Didn't understand at all. And
then I recently told the story to Mark

97
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
about my mom asked me to explain Bitcoin
to her and I couldn't so then I like did a

98
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
deep dive and I was like, oh, this
actually makes a lot of sense now that I'm

99
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
like, I don't know what made it click this
time that didn't happen before but I think

100
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
maybe I just had a better understanding of
finance and like the world economy and I

101
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
could kind of see a place for it. So yeah,
that's my story. So next, I was gonna ask

102
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Wade, where are you in your understanding
of Bitcoin and crypto? How would you

103
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
describe Bitcoin? What would you say if I
asked you to explain it in one minute?

104
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll do my best guys. Anyone else out
there listening, go easy on me. It's

105
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
written on a program that creates a
blockchain, which creates a ledger, which

106
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
is mined at certain intervals based on the
difficulty of the state of the program, it

107
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
rewards bitcoins after certain amounts of
programming input to a processing power

108
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
from GPUs. And then it's something that
was created with a finite resource and it

109
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
was meant to be mined over a certain
period of time and just slowly being

110
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
chipped away by all the GPUs out there. I
understand the idea of the blockchain with

111
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
it can be traced back through the program
through that and for what I understand

112
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
also is made by a fairly anonymous source
that's kind of like up for debate who it

113
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
was, a few people trying to claim who it
was at the same time so. It's

114
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
decentralized, it's not controlled by a
federal government or anything like that

115
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and it's stored in digital wallets on
computers that keeps track of the certain

116
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
keys of what's what, how many coins you
have, or you can protect it with the

117
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
encrypted with the password and exchange
that between users for a certain fees on

118
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
the chain as well. And basically send that
all over the world then that way. And

119
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
yeah, it's a digital currency.

120
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah, absolutely. That's pretty good. I
would say you're like already in the 99th

121
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
percentile.

122
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
All right, so I would. Okay,
understanding of programming. When I

123
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
learned it, to begin with, I learned
C-sharp, C++, HTML. I've done some small

124
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
programs before. Mark and I have even sat
down and we've messed with some of the

125
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
data that I have from the drones that I
use and gone over some programs. He's way

126
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
more adept at it than I am, but I at least
through my school understand the language

127
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
of computers in that way. I don't think
it's something that I could sit down and

128
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
just come up off from the top of my head
right now today, but I understand the ones

129
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and the zeros as in the if then, the input
and output of a program like that. So I

130
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
could at least have some sort of
foundation to to build off of at least for

131
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
comprehension and understanding.

132
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think you showed a
pretty good understanding right there. I

133
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
guess if I were to like critique anything,
it would just be like little tiny bits

134
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
like some of them use GPUs. Others use
application specific circuits and CPU also

135
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
or just GPU. I'm sure be way less
efficient with the CPU. Different cryptos

136
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
use different things. And I think I want
to say Bitcoin started with the CPU. Is

137
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
that right, Mark?

138
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah, totally. So that was like the
initial but as the difficulty increased,

139
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
then smaller and smaller likelihood of
finding a block on CPUs and then people

140
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
quickly moved over to GPUs. And then
finally, like you're saying, Tim, the

141
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
ASICs.

142
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah, when I talk to new people, like
zero or very little understanding, I just

143
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
try to get out that it's a distributed
ledger that you have to use energy to

144
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
change. And so all these people are
competing with their energy use to make

145
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
changes to the ledger. And then the other
part that is point where people maybe make

146
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
an assumption is like the coins are in
your wallet like it's really just the

147
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
blockchain and the blockchain associates
coins with your wallet like that's not

148
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
quite it's not quite accurate.

149
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The wallet stores the keys to that part
of the chain. Yeah, the addresses to the

150
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
chain where it's where you got the box.

151
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So the wallet, I think, has the private
key to which gives you the ability to

152
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
spend a given box and within that box is
your specific asset. So your wallets that

153
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
are tied to your private keys can be you
could have a bunch of different boxes, but

154
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
consolidated, they could have whatever
summation amount of crypto is in that box.

155
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And then in order to spend that box to
create a new box, with UTXO so unspent

156
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
transaction output. So if I wanted to send
you say 10 ERGs or like however much

157
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Bitcoin I have to burn the boxes that are
in my that are signed by my private key

158
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and only by my private key and then send
them to you and then that's the only way

159
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
you can send it and so like what Tim was
saying it's the wallet is sort of a view

160
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
within the blockchain, then the subset of
these blocks are only spendable by you

161
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
with this specific protocol.

162
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yeah, that's a really good point to bring
up too is like the public private keys. So

163
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
one of the concepts in cryptography is
like a puzzle that is hard to solve, but

164
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
easy to prove, right? So I have a private
key that only I know. And it's like

165
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
cryptographically matches my public key,
but you can't go from the public to the

166
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
private. I can go from private to public
and that allows me to send keys or send

167
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
coins rather, but people can only kind of
see where it's coming from through the

168
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
public address and they're not able to
derive my private key.

169
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And then that brings in a good segue for
what smart contracts are. So

170
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
traditionally, when you get sent tokens
into like the boxes in your wallet,

171
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
they're only spendable if you sign that
transaction but now smart contracts are

172
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
another layer to that to where you can
sign and say hey i'm going to send this to

173
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
tim but or this other condition is true.
So for example, say you have some type of

174
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
delayed dispersion. So like in 10 minutes,
I'm going to send this amount to Tim, or I

175
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
can send it right now. But otherwise it
can get spent by Tim and then you can run

176
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
what's called off chain bots to then
collect those boxes are then spendable.

177
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And then they send that to Tim
automatically. And so then that's where

178
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
the programmatic sort of idea comes into
play.

179
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah, and pretty much every real world
financial asset or application. You can

180
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,000
think of borrowing, lending, derivatives,
baskets of things. You could build all of

181
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:11,000
those things to be done automatically with
a smart contract. So Mark might want to

182
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:19,000
borrow some money because he wants to go
short or long some other asset and the

183
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
contract would enable that as well as like
a ton of other things.

184
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The idea of smart contracts really seems
fascinating to me too and something I've

185
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
talked with people about for a while would
help in my business to automate certain

186
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
things when it comes to collecting
payments from clients. Again, I think

187
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
you'd have to see a lot more mass adoption
of, I think, the underlying assets by

188
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
clients of mine that are a lot less tech
savvy than I am in some cases. But I think

189
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
the concept is super promising.

190
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And even from a security standpoint,
right? So, kind of differing from chain to

191
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
chain, we have different smart contract
languages that are able to write these

192
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
contracts. So Ethereum is notable for the
languages escaping me. Anyways, but they

193
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
can be not hacked but people write in
within so on Ergo it's called a Sigma

194
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
prop. And so the Sigma prop if true that
box gets to be spendable. Now on Ethereum

195
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm not sure what the case is but people
are able to put sort of an or statement so

196
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
then if that becomes true, you can then
spend that on Ethereum and that's how

197
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
people get hacked for like millions of
dollars because they put so much money

198
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
into a proxy contract. So another entity
kind of holding these funds, these boxes,

199
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I guess it's different on Ethereum. But
then because of that sort of flaw within

200
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
the smart contract is then able to leak
funds from that contract unexpectedly.

201
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Speaking of adoption and losing your
money, what doubts and reservations do you

202
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
have about crypto broadly, Wade? You're
what we call a normie and a no-coiner.

203
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What gives, man?

204
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I mean, yeah, full disclosure for the
audience right now, I'm not holding any

205
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
coins or anything, any crypto. Yeah, puts
me kind of on the outside as someone who

206
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
is interested in it. But I think just my
risk tolerance for this point, I've done

207
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
pretty okay and stock investing over the
last six, seven years of my career, we had

208
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
a pretty bullish stock market as well,
which has enabled me to buy some real

209
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
world assets too with that. And I've kind
of just been taking the tortoise or the

210
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
hare philosophy a lot when it comes to
that, the slow and steady wins the race.

211
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But I am interested in the technology
itself of cryptocurrency and its future

212
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
use potentials. And I think we're getting
a lot closer to a point where I think

213
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
enough people have heard and understand
about it that it's making more and more

214
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
sense as time goes on, especially with, I
think, the positive outlook that we're

215
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
going to have over the next four years in
the US and how a lot of people are now are

216
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
even more bullish about Bitcoin because of
this new administration that we could have

217
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
a lot more adoption of it, which makes it
more inherently viable and makes more

218
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
sense for people to hold when there's a
lot more hands that it could be exchanged

219
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
from. I think more reservations I have
about it is if, I was talking to my

220
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
brother about this concept a little bit.
We're talking about, well, the idea of

221
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
investing in something like gold, for
example, not even Bitcoin, but gold said,

222
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
okay, well, if I want to invest in
something like gold to hedge against a

223
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
downturn in the market, I could buy a gold
that the point would be to buy a gold bar,

224
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
not just a gold exchange fund, because
then you're losing the utility of that. If

225
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
the stock market goes down, if the
networks go down, you don't even have

226
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
access to that. So you want a gold bar,
but then if you have a gold bar and now

227
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
you want to exchange that for food it's
kind of hard to break that bar up for food

228
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
right so then i think of i the closest
thing i can compare bitcoin to and this

229
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
might not be completely accurate would be
gold it's a great store of some value and

230
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
some proof of that energy expenditure i
think if i wanted some other form of

231
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
reserve besides the stock market in case
the stock market would crash or the

232
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
network fails or weren't even worse
scenario in the world, is thinking of like

233
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
a prepper mindset, then I probably
wouldn't be able to access that or

234
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
exchange that between people either, I
fear. So if it came down to the apocalypse

235
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
or something like that, I'd probably
rather have a pack of cigarettes to try to

236
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
trade people, or a can of food or gas in
that way, because that's what I think of

237
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
people would have some sort of value. I
watched some prison shows talking about

238
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
the currencies that they've developed
there between them without actual other

239
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
physical money and come down to bartering.
So if it was the end of the world, I'd

240
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
probably rather have a gas can than a
million dollars of Bitcoin in my digital

241
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
wallet that I can't even turn on
potentially. But I don't think it doesn't

242
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
have value today, but I think just to me,
and I'm not even that much of a doomsday

243
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
property to begin with, but I think until
that scenario happens that I still have

244
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
lights like my traditional stock
investments as a place to fairly safely

245
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
keep some savings.

246
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yeah, I mean, everything you said is
totally reasonable, dude. So I guess I'll

247
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
go back like from the beginning. So you
said it's funny how the bigger it gets,

248
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
like the more valid it kind of becomes,
which is a little bit inverse to some

249
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
stocks, right? Like we see Nvidia and the
chart is like going like this and you're

250
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
like, that's probably a bubble. But now we
see Bitcoin doing that. It's like knocking

251
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
on the door of 100K today and like, oh,
that means it's more valid and it's

252
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
probably safer to invest in than it was at
$15K, which is just inverse. It's like a

253
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
different mode of thinking about Bitcoin
versus stocks.

254
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think it also
just the volume of trades at any way. And

255
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
the fact that it's still with Bitcoin, as
far as I know and understand, you don't

256
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
have to trade a full coin like you do with
a full stock. You don't have to buy one

257
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
share. You can buy a partial.

258
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Divisible to a million parts. Yeah.
Right. So another thing that you said that

259
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
was good, there's a good analogy. You're
like, oh, if I have the gold ETF, I don't

260
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
actually have any gold. We say not your
keys, not your coins. So yeah, man, like

261
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:31,000
if you don't have the actual asset, it's
like you're trusting somebody or some

262
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,000
system to uphold your value that you're
trying to save. And that's a risk. It's a

263
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,000
counterparty risk, for sure.

264
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yeah, like having I also thought that too
about cryptocurrency, I think in a point

265
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
to where, and like I said, I've traded
some on Robinhood in the past when I was,

266
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I think, kind of popular in its own way.
And then I realized ultimately that I'm

267
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
not holding that true asset, I'm just
buying their holding of it basically. So I

268
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
think it would be important, I think, for
my future self to obtain crypto assets to

269
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
actually have it in my own wallet as well,
like you're saying.

270
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yeah. So your last point was about kind
of like that worst case scenario. How

271
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
would crypto actually be useful? Which is
actually a good thought exercise. I think

272
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
like real worst case scenario, yeah, like,
internet's gone. Electricity is only

273
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
available if you have a solar panel.
That's like a real problem. But I think a

274
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
lot of people would be really messed up in
that case then too. And then I'm also kind

275
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
of thinking about Bitcoin as probably the
most resilient money there that's digital.

276
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So as we approach that limit, everything
is going to fly to that safety. And so in

277
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
that process, it would become more
valuable. We still have things like

278
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Starlink and every other satellite
internet provider or whatever. That would

279
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
be online for a while. And then also
thinking about some technologies that are

280
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
developed on Ergo, it's like you could
make transactions with email and flip

281
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
phone. We were even talking about could
you program it to use radio waves? Like a

282
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
ham radio, could you put out a signal that
somebody would be able to interpret as a

283
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
transaction? Which is pretty low tech in
terms of hardware requirements and energy

284
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
requirements. Cool to think about.

285
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Scary. You still need a node, I guess, at
the end of the day. As long as there's one

286
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
person that can kind of broadcast, hey,
connect to my node and we can facilitate

287
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
this transaction for you. But what's
interesting about Bitcoin, I guess, also

288
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
would be the fact that as more people
flock to it, it becomes probably more

289
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
resilient, right in the price. So probably
less volatility kind of over time,

290
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
similarity, I guess, to gold in some
sense, because, and especially if there

291
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
is, I guess, some sort of apocalyptic type
tragedy that would happen. then

292
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
effectively the less people would be
mining it right and so less people mining

293
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
it then the fixed supply just gets just
got really more fixed in some sense and so

294
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
would probably protect the value of it.
Whereas other currencies, like the idea

295
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
with gold is, well, there's only so much
gold. And then back in the day, they were

296
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
trading seashells or they were making
these stones and things like that. Well,

297
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
until new tech came along and was like,
oh, well, I can collect seashells faster

298
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
now. And so that just crashed the currency
and things like that. I think with

299
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Bitcoin, it kind of protects that, right?
Because of mining, mining protects that

300
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
new supply coming in. So this is going to
be a limited amount of stock relative to.

301
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah, no, that's a good point, Mark. I
think the supply would be fixed then and

302
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
demand would, the demand, I think part of
it is what, the supply is a good argument

303
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
to make. And I think that's extremely
solid. The demand part of it, I'm not sure

304
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
would be there because I wonder what the
minimum equipment requirements would be to

305
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
exchange hands of it then because if I had
a dollar in my hand, for example, I all I

306
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
have to do is hand that to you. If I have
a coin, do I have to have a and again, I

307
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
know this is like the worst case scenario
and probably not going to happen. But I

308
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
did just live through two hurricanes in
Florida where I lost power for five days.

309
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I tell you what, there was lines around
the corner, gas stations waiting for gas

310
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
and my generator was extremely helpful to
be able to use here. So I might need a

311
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
generator, I might need a laptop or a
phone to power that and maybe some sort of

312
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Starlink or cell service for internet. In
that case, it's probably the minimum you

313
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
might need to exchange crypto in that
case. I think again, I think that's just

314
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
an extreme case of that. And I think most
of my investing philosophy is just way

315
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
more cautious, but I again, I do think the
technology has crazy potential. And I'm

316
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
here talking about it, because I do think
it's very interesting and could have a lot

317
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
more value in the future as it does today.
And not only just to us, but future

318
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
generations might find more value and I
think it's ultimately up to the masses

319
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
like that to decide what direction we want
to go in and I think people are betting

320
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
with their money right now that this could
be one of those avenues.

321
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yeah, and I think relative to stocks,
right? So Bitcoin is very much this hard

322
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
money asset, whereas stocks is kind of
people, I wouldn't say it's hard money,

323
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
right? Because if you think about it,
people say there's a fixed supply of like

324
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Tesla or Nvidia, but that's not
necessarily true, right? Because every

325
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
five years, every three years, they do a
stock split, and it's effectively adding

326
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
10 times more of the stock supply, and
they're just essentially printing stock,

327
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
whereas Bitcoin and even Ergo, it's less
so and then specifically bitcoin and ergo

328
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
the hardware requirements to set up this
sort of stuff is a lot cheaper and easier

329
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
people are selling these miners and then
they break within like the first few

330
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
months and they cost like ten thousand
dollars not super ideal and in a similar

331
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
case for some of these stocks in order to
buy like At one point, what was it,

332
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
NVIDIA, it was like $1,300 or something.
That's a little outrageous, but of course,

333
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Bitcoin's 90 something thousand now and
that's, so that's not really ideal, but

334
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
the idea that you can be divisible by like
all these different sort of units of time,

335
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
but then also Bitcoin can't go bad. You
can buy a million dollars worth of gas,

336
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
but probably will go bad in a few months
or you could buy a million dollars worth

337
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
of cigarettes, but if it rains on the
cigarettes, that's a lot of cigarettes to

338
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
buy, and so from Bitcoin is able to
translate over time but also space but

339
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
then also corruption in terms of like the
environment and not political corruption

340
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
but just you can't corrode Bitcoin just
like gold right and so in a similar sense

341
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
right you can see that sort of split
between all the different gold silver

342
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
copper within the coins transfer of those
assets they're able to translate space go

343
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
across the world sort of thing and still
kind of maintain their value and that's

344
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
something I think a lot of people want,
right? I would say it's less so of like

345
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
number go up, but more of just like, let's
preserve my value, because right now the

346
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
governments, who knows what they're gonna
do, and I just wanna preserve my assets,

347
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
whatever those assets are, and not have
them go down, or just like slowly go down

348
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
over time, right?

349
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So something I say is the point of crypto
is not to make you rich, but to make you

350
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,000
free. So we're at the beginning of that
adoption curve, and so the investment

351
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,000
potential is there, but that's not the
point. The point is to give people another

352
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
option that's not controlled or
manipulated by others, and the supply of

353
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
dollars or stocks is controlled by people,
and the supply of Bitcoin is controlled by

354
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
code. And so it's not up for debate about
what it is and what's gonna happen. So

355
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
that being said, I like to talk to people
about why having a hard cap supply is

356
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
important. I don't necessarily think that
Bitcoin would be the world's reserve

357
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
currency. I don't know. That's not like my
base case. I kind of think the main

358
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
benefit is just having another currency to
compete with all the other currencies so

359
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,000
that it holds them honest, right? Because
I think something like 70% of all the

360
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
dollars were printed in the past like five
years. So like, that's mind blowing,

361
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,000
right? That's a lot of dollars. And who
knows what the effect is going to be like

362
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
they just did it because they felt like
they had to. And so as somebody who's

363
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
forced to use those dollars, I should have
a choice to like have this other thing.

364
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And I feel like Bitcoin and cryptos that
are specifically proof of work. They kind

365
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
of just give me an option where I know the
outcome. I know what it is. I can verify

366
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
all the parameters. And whereas the
dollar, I know that it's going to be

367
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
accepted. They just changed the definition
of M2, which is like the money supply in

368
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
the past few years. You look up M2 on the
chart and it's like, and they're like, oh,

369
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
we don't use this anymore. They're like,
yeah, I bet.

370
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That's a great point, Tim. Yeah, you
don't have control over that other lever

371
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:59,000
then that's so important to economic
supply and demand that that other lever

372
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:07,000
gets pulled in the wrong direction for
majority of people that are forced to use

373
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:15,000
this currency. I think you make a really
good case when you cite examples of

374
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:23,000
hyperinflation in some South American
countries if you look at what's happened

375
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:31,000
down there in certain places where they
have just inflated the crap out of their

376
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:39,000
currency to where the spending power has
just become so insignificant in some ways

377
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:47,000
that it's millions of dollars in whatever
currency that is for a loaf of bread or

378
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:55,000
whatever that may be. So I think there's a
great case for crypto that you're making

379
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:03,000
in that way. And then one that I think
principally, I do believe a lot. And I

380
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:11,000
think maybe if I'm allowed to segue this
into another category, we talked about the

381
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:19,000
top one a lot, Bitcoin, that's obviously
the biggest market cap. How does that

382
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:27,000
trickle down? And what need for other
blockchains have come out of that or have

383
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:35,000
been invented after that and maybe help
explain to me some of the other use cases

384
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:43,000
of different coins or maybe especially
Ergo in your guys case.

385
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yeah. So I think Mark kind of hit on it a
little bit previously where originally

386
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Bitcoin was really just a tool for
transacting and sending and receiving

387
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
those coins and had to do that manually.
It didn't have that smart contract

388
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
functionality that we talked about. So in
2015 or 2016, Ethereum came out and that

389
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
was really the first smart contract
application that arose. And just kind of

390
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
being the first one, it had a lot of
flaws. We found that there are more

391
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,000
efficient ways to do things, more secure
ways to do things. And that has led us to

392
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Ergo, where it's kind of, it's doing a lot
of things, right? So when I introduce

393
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
people to crypto, I tell them there's a
lot of scams. A lot of people are just

394
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
trying to make your money and they're not
very transparent about what they're

395
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
selling you and so Ergo one for me was
just a line with my values like everything

396
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,000
is open source like there is a team that
they received very little money in terms

397
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
of like the whole coin allocation they got
like 4% of all the tokens and they they

398
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
publish a verifiable budget and like
expense everything like you can see every

399
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
dollar that they've spent. So that to me
just made a lot of sense and it made it

400
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
really clear. And then overall the goal is
to reduce the technological requirements

401
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
as much as possible so as many people
around the world can access it as

402
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
possible. And then with that, they don't
take any technological risks. So they only

403
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,000
use cryptographic principles that are
proven, starting with Bitcoin. So they

404
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
basically took Bitcoin's code and took the
most the safest, most proven aspects of

405
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,000
that and then kind of built on top of it
without inventing the wheel again and

406
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,000
trying to accomplish something that's not
proven. So it's like, no, if we don't know

407
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
that it's secure, we're not going to do
that.

408
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
and and then like from other tokens right
so you have litecoin you have doge those

409
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
are just mere copies literal copies of the
same so it's a fork is what it's called so

410
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
you can have the same consensus and then
some miners can then say hey we're going

411
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
to go over here in this lane But we're
going to call this Litecoin. And so then

412
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
they facilitate Litecoin, new miners stand
up, new mining rigs for here. And so now

413
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
you have a new blockchain kind of
entirely. So Dogecoin was done, I think

414
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
was the official first meme coin. Litecoin
was to be like, hey, or like silver, so to

415
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
speak. And then you have all these other
sort of paradigms that kind of switch to

416
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
where Like we were talking earlier,
Bitcoin was the CPU miner. Then we moved

417
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
the GPUs and then quickly moved into
ASICs. So application specific integrated

418
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
circuit. All they can do is mine Bitcoin,
literally nothing else. And so as that

419
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
quickly started to get stood up, it's like
10K now for a Bitcoin miner. Not really,

420
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
like Tim was saying, like not really
accessible to the general population,

421
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
right? And so what is really cool about
crypto or Ergo is the fact that you can

422
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
buy a A GPU now for like a couple hundred
bucks right you can put up maybe hook that

423
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
up I saw somebody hooked hooked up an AMD
GPU to Raspberry Pi and then you can be on

424
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
your way start collecting mining tokens
and things like that and so from an

425
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
accessibility perspective super important.
And then just the smart contract layer

426
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
compared to Ethereum to Ergo, Ethereum has
what's called gas fees and these gas fees

427
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
can be like maybe 20 bucks to a hundred
bucks and you're maybe trying to send like

428
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
five. So you're spending more in
transaction fees than you are actually in

429
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
what you're trying to transact. And then
an additional note is that you can try to

430
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
send this and it can fail and then you
lose everything. Like you don't get that

431
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
back. I'm not really sure where it goes,
but like, so it, and that sucks, right? If

432
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I want to send you some money, I want to
know that you're going to get it. Not that

433
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
it fails and then it doesn't work. So
talking to Ergo, if it doesn't send, it

434
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
doesn't send. There's no like, oh, is it
not, is it? And then additionally, for one

435
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
transaction, it costs, one, 1000th of a
ERG. So it's 0.001. And ERG right now is

436
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
like $1.40. And so super cheap to
transact. So if you wanted to send a

437
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
million dollars, it's going to cost you
0.01 ERG just to send it to a given

438
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
address. And then other things, you can
see there's more copies. Or there's

439
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
different consensus protocols. So we have
proof of work. That's what we're actively

440
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
talking about with all these tokens that
we are coins rather that we've talked

441
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
about. But then there's proof of stake,
which is a different consensus mechanism.

442
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So Cardano is primarily proof of stake.
Ethereum moved the proof of stake. And so

443
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
basically what that basically is is you
need to buy a specific asset. You need to

444
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
hold that asset. And then those, you run
some code by putting those assets in

445
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
there. And then that is sort of
facilitates the consensus protocol. And so

446
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
you have what's called stake pools. And so
you have stake pool operators and you can

447
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
stake your ADA onto those stake pools. And
then those find the blocks and then those

448
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
facilitate the transactions. There's some
key to debate sometimes between what's

449
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
more secure, proof of stake, proof of
work. I like proof of work because, again,

450
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
it goes back to that accessibility
perspective. So if you wanted to set up a

451
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
mining pool, Wade, all you would have to
do is just run some code. You don't even

452
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
have to be a miner. You don't have to run
any type of mining equipment, but you

453
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
could set up your own mining pool. But if
you wanted to be a stake pool operator,

454
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
you need millions of ADA. And so ADA is
like, 70 cents right now. That's a lot of

455
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
fucking money. Excuse my French, just to
get so it's like, it's art, so if you

456
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
wanted to be a stakeholder, you need to be
on it from the very early on. Whereas

457
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
right now, if you wanted to be a mining
pool operator, it's easy to do and will

458
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
always ever be easy to do. So I think kind
of going back to why Ergo, why we like

459
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
really Ergo is like the principles, it's
for the people, it's not really like, oh,

460
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
if you have a lot of money, we're going to
favor you like other chains might, we're

461
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
really for like that accessibility
perspective and kind of putting that power

462
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
into the people and having, I guess, less
attack vectors to that, right.

463
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Accessibility is huge for more adoption
of these ideas.

464
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,000
The critique of Proof of Stake that I
like the most is just that you have 10% of

465
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,000
all the coins on the proof of stake and
you stake those, you're always going to

466
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
have 10% of the coins because you earn
interest for holding, for staking those

467
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
tokens. And so it's not really a level
playing field for people entering the

468
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
space, like Mark said. So for a group of
work, it's like you might have all these

469
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
miners set up. But difficulty increases
over time. Technology increases over time.

470
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And so new entrants kind of really get the
edge. They get the advantage. In five

471
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,000
years from now, the quality of solar
panels and graphics cards and just

472
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
literally everything is going to give that
person the advantage over whoever's been

473
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
mining for the last five years. They might
have more coins, but their production

474
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
capability is going to be way higher.

475
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Right. It's kind of like easy money in
that sense, right? Where the idea, I

476
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
guess, of easy money is, there's these
people, select few, right, who have a huge

477
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
pile of this given asset, a huge
stockpile, and then they're selling it to

478
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
these newcomers, right, at a higher price
and then versus hard money, right? It's

479
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
it's fixed. It's easy to get on board. If
you haven't read the Bitcoin standard, I'd

480
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
read it and read it again. Really great
book.

481
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
The book I recommend people is Broken
Money by Lynn Alden. That was really good.

482
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
She kind of goes through the history of
money and talking about seashells and gold

483
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
and then credit systems and fiat and all
this stuff and the challenges with each

484
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
and how crypto can solve those challenges.
I thought it was great and she has a lot

485
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,000
of content online. Yeah, that's who I
recommend Newton's to.

486
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I'll check some of those out.

487
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So Wade, maybe just to end, I'm
wondering, do you have any advice for us

488
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
about how to talk to people who aren't
interested? Because, I don't know when

489
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
this will come out, but Thanksgiving's
coming up and people are gonna be like,

490
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Hey, am I bitcoins doing awesome? How do
we talk to people who aren't into crypto?

491
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Like, did we do a good job? Or do you have
any any recommendations?

492
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
That's a really good question. And you're
right. There's probably a lot of

493
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Thanksgiving conversations happening
around who's doing really well in this and

494
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
who's upset at other things. Maybe my
ideas or perspective is making it less

495
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,000
seem like an exclusive club. And I don't
think it necessarily is, but I think there

496
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
is some technological facade to some
people when no one questions holding or

497
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,000
having fiat currency, people might be more
or less savvy with it, but no one doesn't

498
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,000
understand having the value of a dollar to
food to X, Y, and Z. So I think making it

499
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,000
more analogous with other types of
currency maybe seeing more transactions

500
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,000
happen with this type of currency, instead
of something that's maybe outside of that

501
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,000
realm altogether seems really helpful. I
think there's certain words to or certain

502
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,000
lingo when it comes to things like that
that make it seem with crypto that makes

503
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
it seem a little more complicated than it
has to be to probably ones that we've even

504
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
discussed today that I might understand,
but to a bigger audience, maybe such as

505
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,000
even just the blockchain or wallets and
digital wallets in that way, maybe, maybe

506
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,000
not. Digital wallet does try to do a good
job of equating what that means. I think a

507
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,000
good- Still seems like a club in some
certain ways that, I understand there's a

508
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,000
big community aspect to get things off the
ground, like that too and what it's taken

509
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
to get to this point, but I don't really
think it has to be, and none of it is to

510
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,000
me inherently exclusive either, to adopt,
to buy, to exchange. in those ways, but

511
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,000
there is just some really benign
observations on, on my end, but again, I

512
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,000
could be far off from what other people
think or dismiss about it too. So I'm just

513
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,000
here to offer one other perspective on it.

514
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
No, that's super helpful, man. And I
think a goal that we have is to make the

515
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
application so that people don't even know
that they're using crypto or a blockchain.

516
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It's like when we send money on Venmo or
whatever, I'm not thinking about code or

517
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
there's no lingo that I use. I'm just
like, no, send me 10 bucks for this pizza

518
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I bought you. And that's it. So once we
get to that point, I think that'll kind of

519
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
alleviate what you're saying there.

520
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah, completely. Yeah, it doesn't even
think you don't even see physical money

521
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
when you send stuff over that online. So
there's no reason to me why that couldn't

522
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
also be done on a different sort of
exchange in that way that could involve

523
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
crypto more than more than likely in the
future.

524
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Would you say even to it's maybe more of
a or not more of a but it could be kind of

525
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
an educational thing to where kind of
understanding the pros and cons of certain

526
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
like money systems, like you were saying,
like, why did the South American countries

527
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
sort of fail with respect to, I think
there's a lot of sort of things happening

528
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
in the country and the world, so it's kind
of hard to tune into specific things as

529
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
well, right? So especially on the day to
day live too, right? So, I don't know,

530
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
what do you think there?

531
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Yeah, it's hard to spread any idea that
far. It seems like there's a lot of other

532
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
noise that happens in the world right now
with gaming content or anything else. I

533
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
think just finding ways to use it in
everyday life that would be applicable to

534
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
people to be able to see how this actually
applies in certain ways, instead of just

535
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
conceptually, but practically as well if
you go to the store and I use, Apple Pay,

536
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
touch to pay, then you don't see any go
across even your credit card, for example,

537
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
it's just happening somewhere else, being
able to do that on, potentially another

538
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
currency, even having gone to Europe and
using an American credit card, it's

539
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
possible to do that. There's just a small
fee that comes off. There's an automatic

540
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
translation that happens there, a
conversion between the currencies. And I

541
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
don't know what the technological
capabilities of that are right now. I'm

542
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
sure it's possible, but be able to
integrate that with normal everyday life

543
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
at some point for people.

544
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
We already got it, brother.

545
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
They call it Babel fees. So you can
choose to spend whatever currency you want

546
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
and then it'll make the transaction on the
back end and you don't even know that it

547
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
happened. It'll just tell you how much it
cost.

548
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Yeah, cool. Yeah, see, that's something
that I haven't experienced with Paul and

549
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I'm sure it would be really cool to see
used in person. And if I saw, Mark using

550
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
that in person, other people around me,
then I think just seeing being able to see

551
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
that firsthand, too, I think, would make a
lot more people comfortable with, with the

552
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
ideas and other currency.

553
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So I think, Wade, what we'll have to do
is I'll have to come over at some point

554
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
and we can set up your GPU to maybe mine
at night so we can start getting your Ergo

555
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
coming in.

556
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
old gaming computer here that I'm not
using right now. It's sitting on the

557
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
floor. So there we go.

558
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Yeah, let's do it, man. Let's get you
some ERG.

559
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Definitely interested. I would be
interested to the difference of the energy

560
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
cost verse, the outputs, but I think that
might be very region specific to in a lot

561
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
of ways. Yeah, definitely. At least worth
to experiment for me.

562
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
All right, we'll have you on in the
future and you can tell us your experience

563
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
as a fresh set of eyes.

564
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Yeah, that'd be great. All right, good
talking to you guys and good to hear what

565
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
you guys are up to and some stuff I
learned today too that I wasn't really

566
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
sure about, but I think the best way would
be just dipping your toes and learning

567
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
something new.

568
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
That's it, man. I feel the same way. I
just like learn. I love to learn. And so I

569
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
meet people like Mark, and they can
explain one little thing at a time. And

570
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
over the years, I feel like I've opened my
mind to a lot of things and just learned a

571
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,000
ton. So it's a cool place to kind of just
spend some free time.

572
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Yeah, and our community is just so great.
I really enjoy talking with Tim.

573
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Obviously, you as well, Wade, and if you
join us in the Telegram or Discord groups

574
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
and ever have a question. people are just
so overly helpful and willing just to kind

575
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
of clarify certain points, which that's a
common reoccurrence within our community

576
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
that we hear. And we're not really gonna
point you to, oh, hey, go buy this token,

577
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
you're gonna make a million bucks or
whatever, right? We're not really trying

578
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
to do anything like that, but if you need
to understand a concept or anything,

579
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
really, people are just so, so, so
helpful. So hope to see you in the chats,

580
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
bud.

581
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Thanks, guys.

582
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
