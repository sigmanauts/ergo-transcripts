1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Happy birthday, Ergo.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Happy birthday, Ergo.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah, cheers to the happy anniversary.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Everyone, happy anniversary.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We've made it to six years old, kushti,
Joe.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Six years.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's quite a feat in this industry.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yeah, still baby.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It sure is.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Still a lot of crawling to do.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So, well, when Bitcoin was six, for
example, I worked with it.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So yeah, it was exactly 2015.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And yeah, well, I think it was more raw
even in regards with multi-sig support.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, for sure.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So yeah, well, I spent a lot of time
trying to do some multi-sig with the

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
script.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So to discover that there is some bug in
Bitcoin script, which I need to replicate

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
after all.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So, yeah, well, hopefully it's less messy
here, at least from my observations.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, nice.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So what's everybody got planned today?

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I know we have a cake coming, not on the
first, but our lab is going to make us a

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
cake on the fourth.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We've made the payment and he's got to go
into, I think he said he goes into the

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
city or something and gets a cake and
brings it back.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Takes a picture and then donates it to
the homeless or the hungry or the

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
unhoused.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
However, you say that word and across the
globe.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So we got that picture coming.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You guys gonna drink yourself silly in
celebration?

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Maybe you can do some drunk coding,
kushti.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I had two coffees today.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How about you, Joe?

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll get ready for the release.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm going to update some packages, test
it.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's see.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I was hoping to get it out today, but we
had something we needed to chase down in a

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
dependency on Ethereum with their latest
hard fork.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So that's been coordinating, updating.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Looks good now.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Joe, it looks like you've spent a lot of
time making some promotional videos that

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
are pretty nice.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, I did this weekend.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I was messing around with the video LLM
with the Doge and you know what I learned

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
is the most important thing for whatever
reason was that I needed to be quite clear

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
that the Doge needed to have paws when it
did the activities.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Otherwise, it grew these weird human-ish
hands and earned some credits.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But yeah, I played around with that.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I got some subscriptions.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So I guess I'll be the generative video
editor for a little bit.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, for Ergo.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Nice.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, let's focus right on what you have
for Ergo up your sleeve, kushti.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You have some announcements about
sub-blocks testing going on that we can

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
excite the crowd with.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah, so there is sub-blocks DevNet
update which is doing quite well at the

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
moment and yesterday I did some load
testing even and it was quite good after

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
all, after some fixes.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So yeah, please feel free to join and
help with testing so I can provide some

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
load testing.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Scripts as well, which are doing
transactions every second from your

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
wallet.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
More news in regards with Ergo Network.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Well, this week we will have maybe a
voting for 6.0 has been started, as well

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
as emission reduction, another one.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And, yeah, well, this emission reduction
would be more aggressive again.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Like, every emission reduction is more
aggressive than the previous one.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So, yeah, well, a lot of things going on
despite summer.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So, yeah, take a look.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's always fun to check what's going on
around, I guess.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
kushti, do you have a message in chat
where people can spin up DevNet to help

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
out with sub-blocks testing?

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You can find some details how to join the
network in the developer's chat.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It requires some knowledge, like building
and running a node against the latest

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
commit in a specific branch.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's doable for many people still, I
think.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And then, yeah, well, maybe we can start
building current jobs and do more in the

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
coming weeks.

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So I think, yeah, well, we are pretty
much on track in regards with starting

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
injecting sub-blocks, supporting mining
nodes into the public test nets from

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
somewhat July, maybe like 15th to 25th,
something like that.

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's exciting.

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I know speedy transactions seem to be the
thing that gets people excited.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So it's amazing that Ergo is versatile
enough to be like, hey, yeah, let's build

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
this into 6.0 and we'll do some testing.

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And sure, you want faster blocks?

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We'll make faster blocks in this way and
still keep the network secure.

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So I think that's amazing.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Dan, what do you want, Dan?

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What's the deal with the bracelet?

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What is that?

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This bracelet?

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Or this bracelet?

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Or this bracelet?

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You have a little Arts and Crafts name
bracelet?

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Did you make that in the Arts and Crafts
class?

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This is Cartier.

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This is from my wife.

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And these two were made by my child that
I wear.

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Are you sure they weren't made by you?

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What's that?

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes, I do.

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I sit down cross-legged and I pull out
the Taylor Swift bead box and I make the

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Taylor Swift friendship bracelets.

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Now that sounds more like the truth.

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Is it supposed to be like your own chain
stuff?

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes, you've got it exactly.

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's so lame.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That is just so lame.

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Happy birthday, Dan.

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Happy Ergo birthday.

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Dan, when did you join Ergo?

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
When did you hear about it?

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Did you know kushti back when he was at
IOHK or did you join after that?

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Of course I've known kushti since like
what, like 2016?

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Beginning of 2016.

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We have pre Ergo.

122
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah, the first time actually I met was
2017, yes 17 maybe yeah but we've already

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
worked on Ergo back then since autumn
2016, yeah like October, yeah we presented

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
initial ideas so well in some inner circle
so yeah basically IOHK folks.

125
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And then I started to invite more people
from late 16, early 17, something like

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
that.

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Well, so, yeah, so the first time I
actually, well, I spoke to Alex in

128
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
meetings.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But the first time I actually ran into
him, actually became aware of his

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
existence on this planet, this human
called Alex, was he was in a series of

131
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
really, really early IOHK research videos.

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So they made these videos with a handful
of researchers working back then and Alex

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
was obviously one of the first ones.

134
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And so he was in the video and he had
like really long hair and yeah, there's

135
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
some video.

136
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah, like the first, the first Ergo
video is basically the same haircut.

137
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I think he was talking about RSCoin or
something like that.

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Anyway, that was the first time I saw
him.

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Then we were in meetings, and then the
first time I met him was in Malta in 2017,

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
in the spring of 2017.

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Charles gave him his favorite book.

142
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It was the Good Soldier Schweik.

143
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah, the first English translation, I
believe, from Czech.

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's like from 1980, 1928.

145
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I was there.

146
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Alex got the first official translation
of his favorite book from Charles.

147
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I was in the room.

148
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't know if I should feel like I was
part of history or not, but that's

149
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
basically when it happened.

150
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
By proximity, Dan, by proximity.

151
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I just, it reminds me of this one time
when I was at this like tea place and I

152
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
was in line with Tony Shalhoub and Matt
LeBlanc and they actually met each other

153
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
in line in front of me.

154
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And I'm just like, hi, and I am Dan.

155
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm not on TV or in the movies, but I am
here.

156
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And so exactly the same thing.

157
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I am Dan.

158
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm not in blockchain stuff that you do
or blockchain stuff that you do Alex but

159
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm here and it was nice and that's the
story end of story.

160
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That is very touching, Dan. What about
you Joe, where'd you come along?

161
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I've kind of been around. I would say
even when Alex was building DenXT, I was

162
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
at least watching that because
programmable money was like super

163
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
interesting, but I wasn't a fan of Proof
of Stake.

164
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I was more into mining.

165
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That's cool.

166
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah, I remember, I think I told you this
story when Ergo just launched.

167
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So I was, in the beginning of all the
Cardano IOHK stuff, they were still like,

168
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
they really were, they were always really
focused on development.

169
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So research and development.

170
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So that was like the main, like the big
thing from the very start, they're really

171
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
focused on research.

172
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So that's why Alex was in play.

173
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That's why Aggelos then came in.

174
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Mario, all these guys that have been
there for a long time, Oleg, all these

175
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
guys.

176
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Actually, a lot of them are still there.

177
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
After I got done with project managing
and before Mainnet, after Mainnet, I

178
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
switched gears and I started doing more
business development.

179
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I started project management in the
company because before that, it was just

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
like clans.

181
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It wasn't actual project teams.

182
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
After that, I switched over to business
development.

183
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So when we started business development,
we're kind of looking for different

184
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
opportunities to generate income.

185
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And so one of the first ones that was
brought to me, or to us, by Charles

186
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
actually, was back in 2019 to set up a
mining rig for Ergo.

187
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I think they actually did end up setting
it up, but I remember that was like the

188
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
first, one of the first things that came
across my desk in 2019, right after

189
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
launch.

190
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But yeah, it was just, they were like,
yeah, we have to set up a mining operation

191
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
for Ergo, it's Alex's blockchain, he just
launched it.

192
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So that was the first time I was directly
plugged in into the whole thing.

193
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It was always from the business side of
it.

194
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So, oh, and Joe, nice to see you and your
nice couch.

195
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Once again, it's been a long time.

196
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah, it's good to be back.

197
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah, well, it's good.

198
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Where's the crock pot?

199
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You always had that crock pot behind you.

200
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't know.

201
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I think it's outside on the stove.

202
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Okay, I got worried a little bit but okay
if it's there, okay, so like a Dutch oven

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
or a crock pot?

204
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
No, that's like this stone thing you cook
food in.

205
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah, nice stone that says that that's a
technical term for it.

206
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
All right.

207
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Well, we got the hits, we got a history
of Ergo.

208
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
All right.

209
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So what are we looking for for the future
boys?

210
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What are you guys excited about?

211
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah, I look at it as kind of a natural
progression.

212
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
We launched Mainnet.

213
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The first step out was the ErgoMixer,
which privacy.

214
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Then we started playing around with
native assets.

215
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Auction House came out.

216
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Then we started playing with
programmability in terms of like SigmaUSD

217
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and DEXes and,

218
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I think that's matured quite a bit in
terms of what's possible to build on top

219
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
of Ergo.

220
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
A lot of our tooling has gotten a lot
better through time.

221
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So I think the best next step is just to
get faster, get more decentralized in

222
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
terms of the hash rate.

223
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Hopefully we see some layer twos that pop
up.

224
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
There's a lot of good designs out there
in the UTXO space.

225
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Just keep chugging along.

226
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Actually, you just reminded me.

227
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I think that we spoke about this in one
of the AMAs a while back, but Alex, didn't

228
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
you actually at first say that you didn't
think it was possible to have auctions on

229
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Ergo and then somebody did it and
surprised you?

230
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Am I getting that right?

231
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Right, so yeah, in just like few days,
yeah, contracts were presented.

232
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's reflected on the forum, actually.

233
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
There is some old topic from like autumn
2019, so yeah.

234
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So yeah, it's quite surprising what's
possible.

235
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So I think, well, at this point, it's
better to avoid breaking the protocol.

236
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Well, there are always a lot of proposals
to do.

237
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes, but yeah, I think it's better to
move gradually and always try to do things

238
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
in a soft-forkable fashion, so not
rejecting the old nodes so that they have

239
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,000
the right to validate the network.

240
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:04,000
In most cases, it's always worth to have
old validators.

241
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
So then, yeah, well, we can do like
hundreds of different things in regards

242
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
with optimizations and building around.

243
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So, well, actually, the work on merge
mined sidechains already started, so we'll

244
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
provide some details in the coming days.

245
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But, yeah, well, the coding already been
started.

246
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Some coding design specs and so on.

247
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah, I think backwards compatibility is
underappreciated.

248
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Please don't rug the devs.

249
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I mean, it's both good and helpful at the
same time.

250
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Look at Microsoft and their legacy code.

251
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
They're a huge juggernaut, but they're
still providing.

252
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I can spin up a 16-bit app with some
compatibility there in the latest Windows

253
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
from back in the day, and it works just
fine.

254
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
There's something to be said about that,
that's for sure.

255
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And I mean, certainly they're not short
of innovations.

256
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I wouldn't say that Windows versus Apple,
just because Apple prunes all their devs

257
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
even.

258
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Apple's famous for rug pulls on devs.

259
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
A new OS comes out and, oh, this doesn't
work, sorry, kind of thing.

260
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I wouldn't say from using both systems
that one's more technologically advanced

261
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
or superior in that aspect of it.

262
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But yeah, I think that's notable.

263
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
100% that Alex can say that these old,
you say 4.0 nodes are running, Alex?

264
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What's the oldest node that's out there
pumping along?

265
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yes, some sudden, well, a protocol update
in regards with the difficulty

266
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:21,000
recalculation.

267
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So, yeah, well, then it's about 4.0.100x.

268
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And also, yeah, they're still in the
network since 2022, and yeah, I think that

269
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
they can stay for a longer time.

270
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yeah, I see.

271
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm looking at the Ergo nodes list and
I'm right at the bottom seeing a 4024.

272
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Oh, no, that's the name of it.

273
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Let's see if I can see any old ones in
here.

274
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's quite a few new ones.

275
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm impressed at how many people have
updated to 6.0 or 6.1.

276
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Wow.

277
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You guys check this out.

278
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
There's a lot of people that pumped the
upgrade to 6.0, kushti.

279
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh, probably miners.

280
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Because he did advertise around mining
channels and so on.

281
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But yeah, I think also some guys updated
6.1.

282
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Because there was no 5.1 release
corresponding to 5.027.

283
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So yeah, I mean, we got into I've skipped
one, 5.1 release actually.

284
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I see 30 nodes on 6.1, kushti.

285
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That's impressive that people are doing
the rocks at that point.

286
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah, 30 of them.

287
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That's amazing.

288
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah, that's quite a lot actually.

289
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I don't know, maybe it was advertised by
someone in Oracle pools group.

290
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So it was advertised by some guy, I
guess, in the SigmaUSD group.

291
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And then maybe in Dexy Gold Oracle pool
group as well.

292
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So I don't know.

293
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I mean, yeah, that's quite a surprising
number, actually.

294
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Quite big considering that the version is
just released like a few days ago.

295
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Well, I'm here.

296
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I need to check out something.

297
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Let's see if it's still there.

298
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Oh, no, I guess it's not running anymore.

299
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Those love letters to Joe in the node
names.

300
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Remember those?

301
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
No, let me find them.

302
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh, Armeanio, Armeanio's wet dream.

303
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's one of them.

304
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Armeanio's bitch.

305
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Is that all you, Joe?

306
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Are you doing this yourself?

307
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Oh, that's not me.

308
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm way too lazy.

309
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm just going to run it with the
standard name.

310
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh boy.

311
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Well, speaking of nodes, I talked about
the interesting project that we dreamed up

312
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
last week at AMA.

313
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And went ahead took kushti's advice and
sunk 5.13, I think it was, because he

314
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
said, yeah, 6.1 is coming out in a few
days.

315
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So sunk that in the node, updated to 6.1,
dropped Explorer on top.

316
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Throw it in the load balancer, and three
of them, and they are out there.

317
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That's explore-p2p.ergoplatform.com and
node-p2p and api-p2p and graphql-p2p.

318
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So the intent is that we're gonna move
off the reliance, not just the reliance of

319
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
the Ergo Foundation providing these nodes
at SONIA or other places,

320
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But the payments from the EF coming down
to that, to pay for that, because those

321
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
are paying for servers draining money out
of the EF's budget.

322
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That doesn't need to be done, especially
on a decentralized peer-to-peer network

323
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
like Ergo.

324
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So right now I have three nodes running,
full explorers ready to go, load balanced,

325
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Aco is testing them.

326
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
He mentioned that there were a couple
tweaks I needed to do to make them match

327
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
the current ones, so I did that.

328
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
They should be identical to the Ergo
Foundation's one.

329
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And the idea is that we have about four
or five interested parties already.

330
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
We'll prep the image on our machine here,
unless you want to use your own hardware.

331
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
We'll ship you the device, and you run
it, and we'll add the load balancer.

332
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And eventually, we'll have 10, 15, 20
community-run and managed explorers

333
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
that are all going through one URL load
balancer.

334
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And we'll flip on the geolocation so that
if you're in China, then it'll use that

335
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
node.

336
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
If you're in the Middle East, it'll use
that node.

337
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
If you're in West Coast, it'll use a West
Coast node or explorer.

338
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So that's the baseline that we're doing.

339
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And then now there's also talk about,
hey, we should also have these guys host

340
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
the front end for Sigma space, have the
front end for ErgoExplorer 2.0, and that

341
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
kind of stuff.

342
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And I love that idea.

343
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
That's fantastic.

344
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I know the original Explorer is not
everybody's cup of tea, which is fine.

345
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And I think these machines probably have
the head space to be able to host those

346
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
front ends.

347
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So really excited about that project.

348
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I feel like it's like, oh, you're a
decentralized peer-to-peer blockchain.

349
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Where are your main nodes that everybody
points to?

350
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh, they're hosted by the EF?

351
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
That to me is like, let's stop that.

352
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Let's fix that.

353
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And let's have them hosted by the entire
community and managed by a DAO.

354
00:24:48,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So it'll be nice to shore that up.

355
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Hey, hey, HQ, welcome.

356
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Very nice, great to see you.

357
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Hey.

358
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Hey, everybody.

359
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Hope you guys are having a nice day and
happy birthday.

360
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Hey, buddy, how are you?

361
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Can you turn on your camera, HQ, but
block it if you don't want to, so at least

362
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
your square shows up on the main page.

363
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Just put a sticky over it and turn on
your camera.

364
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm just using my mobile, so I won't just
keep it like my desk on that side.

365
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
All right.

366
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So that voice that you guys hear is HQ
talking without a picture.

367
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So HQ is, for those of you that don't
know, is a code dev of things like

368
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
MewFinance, MewDex, Mew everything.

369
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Mew, mew, mew.

370
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
What's the new stuff now?

371
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It doesn't really look like a red square.

372
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That's actually his face.

373
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
He's very square and red.

374
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
All right.

375
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Well, I know one red square in Russia.

376
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm just, I'm not saying I'm not
connecting the two, I'm just saying I've

377
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
seen red squares before. They used to be
one in Kiev and then they changed it back

378
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
to something else and anyway. Look okay,
we're not going to go there but nice to

379
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,000
see, well not nice to not see you HQ.

380
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And then we have, is it Shaya or she?

381
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I never can pronounce things right in my
head.

382
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So, so, so, so you have a lot of people
here.

383
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Your voice isn't coming through, Shaya.

384
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Maybe just sorry.

385
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
My name is Shaya.

386
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I just joined in as a cloud.

387
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I didn't know it's going to be such a
small forum.

388
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
This is our intent to trick you into
coming on an AMA, Shaya.

389
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It worked.

390
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yes.

391
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Yeah, so probably other people.

392
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Let's invite for more.

393
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Let me ping the chat.

394
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So Shaya, how are you doing?

395
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Do you need some documentation and so on,
maybe at this point?

396
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I started reading the document you sent
me about the sub-blocks and sub-blocks.

397
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Right.

398
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And I'm organizing my thought about it.

399
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I thought I'd just write down all the
questions I have and then come and seek

400
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
you out in the Telegram group.

401
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

402
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So yeah, well, I will improve
documentation in coming weeks.

403
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So yeah, well, questions and so on would
be appreciated.

404
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It would help to improve.

405
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
There is Mark the shark.

406
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And there should be a disclaimer.

407
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
He's not an actual shark.

408
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
He's an AI shark, actually.

409
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yeah.

410
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Right.

411
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That's fine, guys.

412
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
He might be a shark in a proverbial
sense, but not a literal one.

413
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I met him.

414
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I met him.

415
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
He's definitely a land creature.

416
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
He is, for sure.

417
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
For those that don't know, Mark Leshark
is a community dev and runs the Sigmanauts

418
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
mining pool, which is the best mining pool
in Ergo.

419
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It is a DAO, and it is fantastic.

420
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Yeah, absolutely.

421
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Got a lot of things cooking, for sure.

422
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah.

423
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Also, Mark brought viper coding to
ecosystem for better or for worse.

424
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And yeah, they did a lot of work on MCP.

425
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So on the doing connections between the
blockchain and AI based analysis and

426
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,000
construction of different things.

427
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yeah, MCP is amazing.

428
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Mark inspired me to bring MCP service to
my work, to actually do real things with

429
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
AI.

430
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So absolutely amazing to see it working
against the Ergo blockchain.

431
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yeah, for sure.

432
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I think a lot of the stuff, once you have
the base foundation, relative to AI, it's

433
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
pretty easy to branch off and extend it,
especially with MCPs.

434
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I was able to take the Ergo MCP and tell
an LLM, hey, let's make this for price.

435
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And then within a few hours, made the
price Ergo MCP.

436
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And I think, too, kind of from there,
it'll be interesting.

437
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm not sure if you guys have seen the
Thin Intelligence stuff that I've made.

438
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Basically, it's AI agent that can write
some code.

439
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And so I wrote some smart contracts for
that.

440
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I haven't tested them or anything like
that.

441
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Still needs to do some work.

442
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But the hope would be to kind of create
this platform to where people can throw up

443
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
their own their own LLMs be their own LLM
provider.

444
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And then from there, people can use like
the Ergo MCP and things like that.

445
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And instead of using like anthropic API
keys or OpenAI API keys, kind of like how

446
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
we're doing on CodeUTXO.

447
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So it's a more decentralized LLM usage.

448
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So that'd be kind of interesting.

449
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Exciting, sir.

450
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
By the way, have you checked Aletha White
Paper?

451
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Your thoughts on that?

452
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I have not.

453
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Which one is that?

454
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So it's about autonomous AI on Ergo
blockchain.

455
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Oh, okay.

456
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I think somebody posted on X recently.

457
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I think it's going to be about that.

458
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
AA Shannon, yeah.

459
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So some new GitHub account.

460
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Yeah, I couldn't tell if it was AI
generated or not because I know Stanford

461
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
actually just came up with a mechanism to
generate papers kind of around the same

462
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
time.

463
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So I'd be curious.

464
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But in any case, it looked interesting.

465
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I think Ergo is a great use case for more
super intelligent type of mechanisms,

466
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
especially with the cheap transaction
rates.

467
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And then from that sort of perspective,
having AI agents running on chain and

468
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
maybe having a token where they pay
themselves to do different tasks.

469
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So you have an agent that does task A,
another agent that does task B, and they

470
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
can sort of rent each other to kind of do
specific tasks or have a human do that.

471
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
But we need the tools, I guess, from a
MCP potentially perspective to facilitate

472
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
all that.

473
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
But like it would be nice.

474
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You're talking about an AI run local
economy.

475
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
That's interesting, Mark.

476
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
You come back in a year and there's poor
AI and there's rich AI and they're

477
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
starving each other out.

478
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Yeah, totally.

479
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You could have an AI that generates
images for you, another one that will put

480
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
them into NFTs for you.

481
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You can have a trading AI and they can
all be working together.

482
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Or maybe there's like a manager level AI
that somebody makes and hey, let's make an

483
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
NFT collection.

484
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Let's try to make the most amount of
money if that's like what it's trained on

485
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
or whatever.

486
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It would be interesting.

487
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Obviously, it would be nice to kind of
use AI outside of just like, hey, let's

488
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
just try to make the most money possible.

489
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So that's where I'm not trying to do
things like that, but how can we grow?

490
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I suppose what's the best use case for
that?

491
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Yeah.

492
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
We've got another one that joined us,
Luca from the Ecosystem.

493
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Fantastic.

494
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Great to see you.

495
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
He's just here to show Canada Day.

496
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Oh, wait.

497
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
That's what he's here for.

498
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
He's here to show Canada Day.

499
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Is Dan allowing you to talk, Luca?

500
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I am not.

501
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Are you guys in the same office right
now?

502
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
No, no, no.

503
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
He's back in Canada.

504
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I am in my home office.

505
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:08,000
But I got to send him a message on Slack
though, cause I get it.

506
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Oh, look, it's like, okay.

507
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It's payment for not working on something
and being here, right?

508
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah, exactly.

509
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Same with Shashir.

510
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Same with Shashir.

511
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I'm like, I'm on vacation.

512
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
No, you're not.

513
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
So Luca, you're going to give, I hear
you're going to give a presentation with

514
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
MiGoreng on gluon gold at the Ergo meetup
in October.

515
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Oh yeah.

516
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Well, he sure was going to do the, he was
talking about like, I'm mistaken how that

517
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
works.

518
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
This is pretty different.

519
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

520
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Now, listen, guys, I'm going to be in the
U.S. in what?

521
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
In August for Rare Evo.

522
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And then for this thing, when is it like
October?

523
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
You said October, something like that.

524
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
When was it?

525
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
October 11th, sir.

526
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
October 11th.

527
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It better not be like this many guys at
Joe's house where he invites a soul.

528
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I told you this already.

529
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Okay.

530
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I told you that's not a conference.

531
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It better not be like Surviving the Game
with Ice-T where he's just going to invite

532
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
us to his like retreat and he just ends up
hunting us for sport.

533
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Like I don't want that to happen.

534
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Okay, he's gonna, we're gonna get to
Joe's house. He's gonna have an array of

535
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
20 guns ranging from very deadly to a BB
gun and whoever, again, he's gonna say go

536
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
and you have to just run to the gun you
want and then be, it's all fair game after

537
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
that.

538
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
One of the first conversations I had with
Joe, he sent me, like, either photos of

539
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
stuff he has chainsawed or his chainsaw.

540
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Like, I forgot, what was it, Joe?

541
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It was either, like, something.

542
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I was working outside.

543
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

544
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
He just built these random structures
with the chainsaw.

545
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And I don't know.

546
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
That's art, Dan.

547
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
That is art.

548
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah yeah he might have summoned the
aliens with it I don't know what he did

549
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
with that but that was it so I don't know
I mean Joe is a friend, I like Joe, we

550
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
hung out together a bunch of times but
never at his like in his kingdom, never in

551
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Joe kingdom. You see like that's, that
very selective about his invites.

552
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Like that's another reason why I'm kind
of cautious to ever go to Charles's ranch.

553
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
He's rich, rich people get into weird
sports.

554
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Okay, you never know. He might just be
like really hospitable and be like a nice

555
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
time or he might end up hunting you like
like a buffalo or something. You never

556
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
know these things. Okay, so I'm just
saying Joe.

557
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I'm gonna probably most likely like 95%
I'm gonna be there.

558
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I mean 5% leaving for like Ian does.

559
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
But yeah, I'm planning on being there but
like I said number one it better be more

560
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
than like me QX and like Luca and Shashir
because I've been there done that okay and

561
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
better be more than that and I am, look,
just give me a rifle at least, all right?

562
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You get a boomerang, Dan, you get a
freaking boomerang.

563
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
You get a boomerang, okay?

564
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Maybe a slingshot if you're lucky.

565
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You get a plastic IKEA spoon, that's what
you get, QX.

566
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I sell a lot of rocks in the spring, so
you can grab some there.

567
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yeah.

568
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Mark's going to be there too.

569
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
We've got Allison coming as well.

570
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
We've got CannonQ coming.

571
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
It's going to be a nice, it's going to be
a nice meetup.

572
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yeah, maybe Timur.

573
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Timur is fantastic.

574
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Timur can teach us some BJJ.

575
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
BJJ.

576
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Right.

577
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah.

578
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Yeah, we can have wrestling competitions
during the hackathon.

579
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Did I just listen that you guys are going
to have wrestling matches with BJJ?

580
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Only if you show up HQ.

581
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
That's inappropriate.

582
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
That is very inappropriate.

583
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Anyway, like I said, better be more than
like a quartet over there, okay?

584
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It just means more beer for everybody
else.

585
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
So the Sigs are, we're voting on Sigs
providing a couple kegs of beer.

586
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Unfortunately, Joe wants red beer, so
maybe we'll give him a six pack of red

587
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
beer to keep him happy.

588
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And then we'll do real beer on the other
two kegs.

589
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Oh, wait, quick, quick.

590
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Where's the nearest IHOP to your place?

591
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It's very close.

592
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
10 minutes tops.

593
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Okay good good good okay okay we're good
we're good we're good okay no that's

594
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
breakfast on Saturday Dan you're hosting
breakfast on Saturday. I have, yeah you're

595
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
paying but I'll host it sure. No no you
can get Jamai to pay again just like you

596
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
did in Vegas. No it's Ergo breakfast
sponsored by qx yeah let me sell all my

597
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Rosen.

598
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Oh, Joe, I think it was a direct threat
right there.

599
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,000
He's gonna dump on retail.

600
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Just a small pebble in an ocean, Dan.

601
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
That's all it'd be, don't worry.

602
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
All right.

603
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm looking forward.

604
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It'll be like the first, I guess, Ergo
meetup.

605
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
A lot of crypto conferences, they're, I
don't know.

606
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Oh my God, Joe, they're awful.

607
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Let's just say the barrier of entry is
really high.

608
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And then so I don't know if that's, I
mean, I think it's good for like business

609
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
networking and people connecting within
the industry.

610
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But sometimes I would say it's probably
just out of range for smaller actors.

611
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And I've never really liked that because
I don't know.

612
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I've always wondered like, hey, what if
we just did a I don't know, like a meetup

613
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
thing where it's like, okay, do you run a
node?

614
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Right?

615
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Great.

616
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
You're part of the network.

617
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Well, like the thing, the thing about
most conferences is that I used to do all

618
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
the conference circuits.

619
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And then you eventually figure out that
most of these conferences are either a

620
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
chance to get shit-faced and not have to
pay for food, but then you end up paying

621
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
for an insanely expensive ticket, which
basically you see the same exact people

622
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
you see in every other conference.

623
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
It's literally the same people.

624
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Yeah, I've always thought it was
interesting like, hey, if you throw a

625
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
couple hundred down, like maybe we could
supply some entry level Raspberry Pi or

626
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
something and say, okay, let's take a
minute and teach people.

627
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Oh, workshop.

628
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Hell yeah.

629
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Something like that.

630
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
But.

631
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
That'd be great.

632
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I don't know.

633
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Sometimes I think people forget these are
peer-to-peer networks, I guess.

634
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Well, I feel as somebody who's been in a
booth in a conference and somebody who's

635
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
walked around a conference, I feel as
somebody behind the booth, it's really

636
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
hard to have super long, meaningful
engagement with the people popping by.

637
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
It's more like, hey, here's what we do.

638
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Yep.

639
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Oh, that's cool.

640
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
That sounds good.

641
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Here's this stuff.

642
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
We'll never hear from them again kind of
thing.

643
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I think these kind of meetups really give
the opportunity to really bind with people

644
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
like Dan.

645
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I don't need you to do that.

646
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
That is the worst advertisement for the
Ergo meetup.

647
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Come on, man.

648
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
It is inappropriate, okay?

649
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I don't want to associate it with the
Ergo meetup or the Ergo conference.

650
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
QX.

651
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
You just had to do that.

652
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
It's going to be fun.

653
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
If you guys can't tell, the Ergo Meetup
is going to be fun, regardless if there's

654
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
100 people or 30, 40 people.

655
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Not that kind of fun.

656
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
That's your kind of fun, all right?

657
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
QX, you keep that over in New York.

658
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Don't bring that to Colorado.

659
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Is there any illegal in Colorado or
something?

660
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I don't know.

661
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So look, the thing about conferences is
that like what I do, and I only do like a

662
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
couple a year now. I'll do Rare because
that's like our, the Cardano and Ergo

663
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
communities there.

664
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So that's very specific.

665
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
But if I do something that's more broad
industry,

666
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Maybe do a Consensus if it's close in
Hong Kong or Singapore or whatever.

667
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I try not to go out to Dubai for Token
2049 because it's the same shit, but you

668
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:26,000
keep paying $1,000 to see the same people
five times a year for some reason.

669
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I never figured that out because that's
literally what it is.

670
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah, but usually you can skip the main
conference and speak with the best people

671
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
on the side events.

672
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Exactly, I literally have done that for
the past several times.

673
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Is that why you disappear and make me man
your booth the whole damn time?

674
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I went to Dubai, what was it, last year,
and Alex and Moa, MHS Sam were there,

675
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And I was like, okay, I wanted to, well,
with my luck, it was when there was a

676
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,000
flood for the first time in like 100 years
in Dubai, the sky opened up and it was

677
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:16,000
just like a wall of rain, it got dark at
three o'clock in the afternoon.

678
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
But later on a few days later, we think,
and it opened up, we were able to go over

679
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
to the Palm and hang out there.

680
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It was literally I literally did all of
my networking, all of my meetings without

681
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
going to the conference.

682
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I went to the conference literally for
two hours and probably just got some

683
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
t-shirts and well, but you know what I did
actually MHS Sam was there and he was kind

684
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
enough to give me his pass.

685
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And so I just went to the conference, he
gave me the bracelet and the pass.

686
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I mean, I'm confessing to a crime here.

687
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So I hope you guys don't, but I was just
like, I don't want to pay a thousand bucks

688
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
for this fricking thing.

689
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
But he's like, Oh, it's okay.

690
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You take this and then gives it to me.

691
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And I go in there and people are trying
to talk to me because I had like the name

692
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
thing turned around, the name thing turned
around and then like, I forgot to turn it

693
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
around.

694
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And then, and they're looking, Hey, how
are you doing?

695
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Mohammed Hassan?

696
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Oh.

697
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You don't look like a Mohammed.

698
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I don't know.

699
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Yeah, I got a couple of really strange
looks.

700
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Like, how are you doing?

701
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Mohammed Hassan.

702
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Okay, well, yeah, yeah.

703
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:40,000
So, but anyway long story short, it's
most of the time just a waste of money.

704
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Look, I even been to the ones with
Charles where he get I get like all the

705
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
VIP access and it was still complete
bullshit.

706
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Like, you got VIP access, but it was the
thing is like the VIP access doesn't

707
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
really matter at all unless you're an
actual VIP.

708
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Like if you're a VIP or with a VIP,
that's where all the cool stuff happens.

709
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Because that's basically where everybody
flocks to.

710
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
But if you're actually buying access to
the VIP stuff, you're still stumbling

711
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
around there trying to get into like
another thing that nobody wants you at

712
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
because they know you paid to get in
there.

713
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Yeah, I'm not the biggest fan of the
booth life.

714
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Every year here, Denver is a couple hours
north, so I always go to ETHDenver every

715
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
year.

716
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
And I always have had the best time
either at side events or just talking with

717
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
people outside or eating next to people.

718
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
That's oftentimes where I've met some of
the more interesting characters in the

719
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
space.

720
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I guess like the hackers and the hippies
versus like the people that are trying to,

721
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I don't know.

722
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I did the same thing in Turkey.

723
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I was there for, what was it, ETHGunU,
which was their ETH conference, and

724
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,000
literally all the cool events were
actually not there.

725
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
They were literally other side events
that you could get in for free that were

726
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
just packed, and the main event was
actually kind of lame.

727
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
So yeah, it's I love that there's a lot
of common like I don't know I would say

728
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
generally it seems as though on one path
we have this idea of like unstoppable

729
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
decentralized money and then this other
path it's more like we have techno

730
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
dystopian money.

731
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And you kind of see increasingly a mix
where, I would say, at least in the United

732
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
States, we've got stablecoin regulation.

733
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:54,000
And it's like, OK, well, we can put, I
guess, traditional banks on these systems.

734
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And I'm not going to say that's a
negative thing.

735
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I don't like seeing it directly tied to
the L1, just because then it creates some

736
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
contradictory assumptions long-term, it
seems.

737
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I've always liked the idea of more
unstoppable money.

738
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Privacy-oriented and better assumptions
for users than our current system.

739
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:28,000
But I see that split more and more
obvious going to those events.

740
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
It'll be weird when I go to ETHDenver and
it's Bank of America, stablecoin.

741
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And then right next to it, you have NIM,
Bitcoin for layer zero.

742
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
It's like they're totally opposite ends
of the spectrum, which maybe is a good

743
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
thing because it's an open ecosystem.

744
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
These are open networks.

745
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And so you can't really censor that.

746
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
But I think it is good to try to separate
assumptions into different layers so they

747
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
don't conflict.

748
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I think the next round of conference,
once we're ready, and I think we have some

749
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
things that are ready, I'm going to be
developing another app at work that's

750
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
going to be relevant to this.

751
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
But not like spending the time to send
Sigs to Rare, but sending the Sigs to

752
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
something like Educause, where we can
promote some apps that would be beneficial

753
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
to the educational sector.

754
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Like the integration I have into our lab
management center.

755
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
The next app I'm developing is to try to
do a blockchain version of that stupid

756
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
iClicker tool that they charge students
like $100 for the damn iClicker.

757
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And it's all proprietary.

758
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So imagine doing like iClicker voting and
attendance on the blockchain with your

759
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
free crypto wallet on Ergo.

760
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
When you walk into class, you just scan a
QR code with Ergo Mobile.

761
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
It marks you as absent in the class.

762
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
You're doing the voting, you scan a QR
code under the vote you want, it puts that

763
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
vote in kind of stuff.

764
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
So that kind of stuff, I think, is where
Ergo can really break out and show that we

765
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
have some tools that are beneficial to
other industries and just show up to those

766
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
conferences and advertise it.

767
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Oh, how much does this cost?

768
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Well, iClicker costs this much, this is
just cost the server and a little bit and

769
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
that kind of thing and it's open source.

770
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
You want to run it yourself fine or just
use our front end service and pay us a

771
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
small amount for the front end service.

772
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
So I don't think those big things can
compete with what blockchain

773
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
infrastructure can bring.

774
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:36,000
And have you seen the idea of simple
anonymous voting using stealth addresses?

775
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
So when you send tokens to stealth
addresses, just write along with fee for

776
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
follow-up transaction.

777
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And follow-up transactions are basically
about sending voting tokens to yes or no

778
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
address like you did with initial voting
procedures.

779
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So, yeah, well, you can just use stealth
addresses and then, yeah, the link is

780
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
broken.

781
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
That's awesome.

782
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Yeah.

783
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Yeah.

784
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
SPEAKER_04:
