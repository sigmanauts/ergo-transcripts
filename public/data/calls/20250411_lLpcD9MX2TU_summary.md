# Ergo PoW Blockchain Weekly Update & AMA - April 10th, 2025

## Executive Summary

This weekly community call covered several significant developments in the Ergo ecosystem. The most prominent discussion centered around Palmyra's upcoming cross-chain token launch on August 14th, which will be the first multi-chain launch utilizing Rosen Bridge to deploy simultaneously on Cardano and BNB Smart Chain. The team also celebrated recent technical milestones including the emission reduction to 15 ERG per block and the successful deployment of Node 6.0 RC4, demonstrating Ergo's commitment to non-breaking protocol upgrades.

Technical discussions included progress on advanced ErgoScript features like Merkleized Sub-Syntax trees and Finite State Machines, which will enable more complex and privacy-preserving smart contracts. The call also addressed oracle security concerns, infrastructure improvements following GraphQL load balancer issues, and plans for a Colorado Springs meetup in September/October 2025.

## Notable Quotes

**kushti on Ergo's development philosophy**: *"The idea here is to have a good foundation for building digital financial cathedrals, like solid constructions. And non-breaking protocol, core protocol development is absolutely crucial here."*

**Dan Friedman on Palmyra's regulatory milestone**: *"The company that actually is minting the tokens... had to get a license from the Seychelles FSA, which was the first actually ever utility token license issued over there, which is pretty cool, I think, and that was issued for Palm."*

**qx() on oracle incentives**: *"There is the incentive that if I screw up or start reporting falsely or get a bribe from somebody on the outside, I'm going to cut off any sort of income that I'd be getting from the gold oracle token for the forever, you know what I mean? It'd be done."*
