[00:14] **Armeanio**: Well, welcome everybody.

[00:15] **Armeanio**: Happy Ergoversary.

[00:17] **Armeanio**: I'm here with Alex and we wanted to discuss kind of the state of the state and some potential ideas moving forward that we think are pretty interesting for the community, for miners and I guess for the world in general.

[00:32] **Armeanio**: You know, we've said, many of you have heard Alex say for, I don't know, a couple of years that the world needs better money, it needs better collateral, and we're kind of still stuck in this cycle of spiraling debt that's growing exponentially across the globe.

[00:50] **Armeanio**: Inflation is always rampant in certain areas and that declines kind of the economic purchasing power of people across the world.

[01:01] **Armeanio**: And you also have this vector of economic freedom and freedom from surveillance is becoming more of a let's say history rather than a bright future.

[01:14] **Armeanio**: So definitely there are issues that hopefully we can create tools to address kind of the economic freedom and prosperity of humans around the world.

[01:28] **Armeanio**: That's what open money is about and you know Ergo is kind of this open source project that explores these ideas and tries to implement solutions so Alex how are you doing?

[01:51] **kushti**: Doing well, doing well so yeah well, complex and quite a bit to have so actually a lot of quite positive developments right, like well recognition of the need of well digital stable coins right even in centralized form then yeah well digital gold is going into different reserves but yeah I mean it's also done not very properly usually right so I mean a lot of positive motivation maybe in some positive moments but

[02:24] **kushti**: Also, yeah, well, a lot of things done quite properly, so yeah, there is a lot of work.

[02:36] **Armeanio**: Ideas can be wonderful, but execution is always the hard part, right?

[02:42] **kushti**: Right, yeah, exactly.

[02:44] **Armeanio**: Proper execution where, you know, the devil's in the details and you understand the trade-offs that you're, let's say, building into.

[02:54] **Armeanio**: So I've heard a bit about this idea of better money.

[02:58] **Armeanio**: I wanted to have you introduce that to the community and kind of share your thoughts on, let's say, this idea of ChainCash and building better money for the world.

[03:13] **Armeanio**: What does that look like to you?

[03:16] **kushti**: Right so actually a lot of ideas right which can be found in different forms on the forum and

[03:27] **kushti**: Yeah, saw some white papers and now there is ongoing effort on getting Ergo book done.

[03:36] **kushti**: So yeah, well, what do we have now is kind of good base money, so proof of work assets, right, such as

[03:47] **kushti**: Ergo Bitcoin Monero then yeah some assets which

[04:02] **kushti**: It can be good and also widely used such as real-world assets rights.

[04:09] **kushti**: The biggest one is USDT, which is, well, tokenized

[04:19] **kushti**: treasury basically, right, of some private company.

[04:24] **kushti**: Tether company, yeah, so the reserves are made of different financial tools, right.

[04:34] **kushti**: So it's actually the biggest RWA.

[04:40] **kushti**: But yeah, well, people are trying to tokenize also commodities,

[04:50] **kushti**: real estate and whatever rights to build then financial tools on top of rights in case of USDC and other centralized stable coins, tokenized private treasuries.

[05:11] **kushti**: So, yeah, it's quite more straightforward, right?

[05:15] **kushti**: So we already see a lot of so-called DeFi tooling, right?

[05:22] **kushti**: Well, which is not maybe so decentralized if it's based on some private entities, right?

[05:34] **kushti**: Reserves based on trust to the same entity.

[05:39] **kushti**: But anyway.

[05:43] **Armeanio**: Yeah, I would say that that does tend to be a really interesting thing that we're seeing in the space is like, as this idea of onboarding real world assets kind of increases, we're seeing a really broad spectrum of like, reserve assumptions, right?

[05:59] **Armeanio**: You know, maybe, maybe updated once a month, you know, we're still kind of in like this paper accounting world that kind of digital

[06:08] **Armeanio**: Money has this ability to disrupt, but then you also have kind of, let's say, less, let's say, clear assumptions around certain reserves where you can't directly or independently verify them.

[06:25] **Armeanio**: Some of them haven't been audited.

[06:28] **Armeanio**: It's somewhat of a mixed bag in the space, if you ask me.

[06:35] **kushti**: Right, so then, yeah, well, among us, right, so some, well, core Sigmanauts.

[06:50] **kushti**: Well, many efforts done for formalizing trust issues, for example, and then build better tools such as ChainCash, which is basically a foundation for digital free banking, blockchain-based.

[07:13] **kushti**: also and yeah building also well trustless derivatives algorithmic stable coins and more right so well Bruno for example presented a lot of schemes and continuing to do that

[07:38] **kushti**: So then there are high-level schemes to ensure, for example, risks of non-delivery of physical commodities, right, with algorithmic stable coins and so on.

[07:53] **kushti**: So yeah, well, a lot of theoretical schemes.

[07:57] **kushti**: And now I think there is need to push for practical adoption.

[08:02] **kushti**: That's why we are starting a better money initiative to push all those things for the real world.

[08:15] **kushti**: So we are already connected with different entities such as pro-private companies,

[08:28] **kushti**: well entities like some well African

[08:45] **kushti**: nations interested already experimenting with tokenization and having need for things like project funding for small cooperatives and so on.

[09:03] **kushti**: So yeah, actually a lot of demand for better funding

[09:10] **kushti**: around many areas around the globe, better funding, better money rights, then, yeah, well, in case of, for example, a site cooperatives producing something, there is a big question.

[09:28] **kushti**: Well, how to sell, right?

[09:32] **kushti**: And how to buy.

[09:35] **kushti**: So,

[09:37] **kushti**: There is need for better kinds of money for international trading and so on.

[09:49] **kushti**: A lot of requests, right?

[09:52] **kushti**: So yeah, well, it is still shaping how well it will be done in regards with structuring, funding and so on.

[10:03] **kushti**: But yeah, nevertheless, so all the principles are set and the mission I think is more or less clear.

[10:13] **Armeanio**: Yeah, I would agree.

[10:14] **Armeanio**: Building kind of open source frameworks that don't, let's say, capture people as much as traditional finance has a tendency to.

[10:26] **kushti**: Right.

[10:27] **kushti**: So yeah, well, there are areas where you simply don't have a traditional finance, right?

[10:35] **kushti**: And also Lebanon, for example, two years ago when I visited it and I am pretty sure, well, since back then, the situation is not better, maybe worse.

[10:50] **kushti**: Right.

[10:51] **kushti**: And then, yeah, many places in Africa, Latin America, and so on.

[10:57] **kushti**: And yeah, well, a lot of places with hyperinflation and high interest rates and so on.

[11:04] **kushti**: So, yeah, well, big demand, right, for better monetary solutions, funding solutions and so on.

[11:17] **Armeanio**: So beyond that,

[11:19] **Armeanio**: How are we looking with sub-blocks and kind of your latest work?

[11:23] **Armeanio**: What are you working on these days?

[11:26] **kushti**: So, just doing final sync for 6.0 to propose it to miners.

[11:34] **kushti**: So, at the moment of releasing this video, probably, well, the miners probably would update nodes already and set voting configuration in the setting files.

[11:56] **kushti**: Then, yes, sub-blocks, which actually another.

[12:03] **kushti**: Well, a point of interest rights in regards with.

[12:08] **kushti**: better money.

[12:09] **kushti**: So it's also about high-performance proof of work protocols, right?

[12:15] **kushti**: And better proof of work protocols.

[12:18] **kushti**: There are a lot of hot discussions these days about proof of useful work.

[12:24] **kushti**: And then, yeah, well, high-performance proof of work protocols because, yeah, since

[12:33] **kushti**: The Merge, Ethereum Merge, it's quite clear that Proof-of-Work protocols are no worse at least than Proof-of-Stake in regards with efficiency, right?

[12:46] **kushti**: So there was a myth that Proof-of-Stake is more performant for some reason.

[12:54] **kushti**: which was debunked before the merge.

[13:02] **kushti**: I think that's largely ignored, so now it's quite clear that proof-of-work protocols are actually more efficient, right, because less overhead for agreements.

[13:16] **kushti**: Basically every miner is working on its own.

[13:23] **kushti**: There is no communication needed for consensus except for propagating new blocks found with already valid solution in most cases if it's not a forked block.

[13:41] **kushti**: And yeah, even if it's forked, then many protocols is accounting for such blocks somehow.

[13:50] **kushti**: But anyway, so it's totally asynchronous and most performance kind of consensus.

[13:59] **kushti**: And then there are different approaches, right?

[14:05] **kushti**: How to achieve concrete efficiency.

[14:12] **kushti**: not just asymptotic, how it gets more even spread on peer-to-peer layer among the blocks.

[14:27] **kushti**: And here we have sub-blocks in Ergo, right?

[14:31] **kushti**: And well, there are similar proposals in other blockchains, for example, Tailstorm and Bitcoin Cash, but yeah, well,

[14:42] **kushti**: It's not quite clear when it will be deployed.

[14:45] **kushti**: We still have privilege to deploy things.

[14:54] **kushti**: without, you know, spending years on like resolving some debates in the community.

[15:04] **kushti**: But yeah, well, this time is limited, by the way, so with growth of community, we will get to the same states.

[15:16] **kushti**: Obviously, so yeah, it's better to do well all the

[15:24] **kushti**: Things like that now, but, yeah, I mean, they also non-controversial.

[15:34] **kushti**: I mean, in, in comparison with, well, other options.

[15:40] **kushti**: So it's, it's kind of, pretty, soft kind of soft fork, right?

[15:51] **kushti**: Yeah.

[15:51] **kushti**: In, in regards with activation, it seems to be.

[15:54] **kushti**: So, but anyway, so yeah, well, after 6.0 and

[16:05] **kushti**: Sub-blocks, let's see what would be next upgrades for the core protocol.

[16:14] **kushti**: I think it would be dependent on, well, sidechains implementations and so on.

[16:23] **kushti**: And probably, yeah, would be about, well, maybe taking the best ideas from experiments done there, right, and also start putting

[16:34] **kushti**: Sidechain, but also, well, it's not crystal clear at the moment, right?

[16:43] **kushti**: What could that be about?

[16:46] **kushti**: Yeah, let's see.

[16:48] **kushti**: But hopefully, it will be about, well, pretty soft forks anyway, right?

[16:56] **kushti**: So gradual updates without breaking applications, without splitting community and so on.

[17:03] **kushti**: Yeah, the backwards compatibility is quite important.

[17:08] **kushti**: Yeah, so on every hard fork, it's quite

[17:15] **kushti**: ordinary to lose some part of community.

[17:19] **kushti**: So when I used to be NXT co-developers, so yeah, well, basically the community disappeared after a few hard forks pushed by the main JLP.

[17:37] **kushti**: And well, a few forks cost quite

[17:45] **kushti**: quite brutal even disagreements in the community and so splits.

[17:50] **kushti**: Right.

[17:53] **kushti**: And yeah, even in Bitcoin, right, without any hard forks.

[17:58] **kushti**: So that's a block size civil war actually cost some forks to appear such as Bitcoin Cash and more.

[18:11] **kushti**: So like, yeah, a few new kinds of Bitcoin appeared.

[18:17] **kushti**: And yeah, we can expect more because here now they have talks about demurrage and things like that, right?

[18:28] **kushti**: So we may expect maybe some more forks.

[18:34] **Armeanio**: That kind of leads into the Sigma Chains idea.

[18:37] **Armeanio**: In terms of the Bitcoin protocol itself, one of the more interesting ideas floating around, in my opinion, has always been drive chains.

[18:47] **Armeanio**: It seems like the most practical way to increase the miner revenue of the protocol from side chain activity.

[19:01] **Armeanio**: kind of really reduce their let's say economic reliance on the block subsidies without needing to touch.

[19:13] **Armeanio**: You know, let's say demurrage or the CAP or, you know, some of the other more controversial proposals for extending the security model.

[19:26] **Armeanio**: And, you know, I guess potentially open up some avenue for innovation and expansion on top of the protocol, which right now

[19:37] **Armeanio**: You know, you have all of these different Bitcoin layers and you have some You know, I guess more or less interesting designs in terms of like You know trustless relays on top of Bitcoin or you have something like Rosen but kind of this idea of Let's say merge mined drive chains.

[19:57] **Armeanio**: I've always thought was the most practical like long-term path to

[20:04] **Armeanio**: I don't know.

[20:05] **Armeanio**: Let's say sustainability and security for Bitcoin itself.

[20:10] **Armeanio**: And, you know, merged mining is, you know, pretty interesting to watch.

[20:14] **Armeanio**: You know, we see that in the ASIC world on script miners with Litecoin, Dogecoin.

[20:23] **Armeanio**: We're starting to see that show up in kind of the CPU space with Monero and then different merge mined projects that are kind of

[20:34] **Armeanio**: Creating additional revenue streams on top of that security and so I do think that there's a big benefit to pulling that into the GPU space and potentially hardening Ergo long term and opening up the same potential path for sustainability of security and

[20:52] **Armeanio**: innovation and also some interesting trustless interoperability that actually does, I would say is probably the cleanest way to get chains to communicate.

[21:05] **Armeanio**: It's just a more complicated method than what we see around.

[21:11] **Armeanio**: What are your thoughts on that general idea or direction?

[21:17] **kushti**: So, yeah, I think, well, merge mined sidechains could provide, well, significant revenue boost, right, for miners.

[21:31] **kushti**: Well, it is especially clearly seen in Litecoin, right, so when I visited some

[21:42] **kushti**: conferences so I witnessed some ASICs advertisements promoting some script ASICs as Dogecoin and Litecoin, right?

[21:59] **kushti**: So the Dogecoin put in the first place but it's merge mined sidechain of Litecoin just so

[22:06] **kushti**: Yeah, Litecoin is number two, right?

[22:11] **kushti**: The main chain.

[22:13] **kushti**: And yeah, well, the sidechain is number one.

[22:16] **kushti**: So it's not so clear in Bitcoin, but yeah, there are a lot of merge mined sidechains.

[22:26] **kushti**: Maybe not so many, right?

[22:28] **kushti**: But there are a few more or less.

[22:32] **kushti**: thriving well with their own communities, even in the ecosystems, merge mined sidechains.

[22:43] **kushti**: And recently, yeah, well, some started to appear around Monero, done by Tari Labs, and well, there is upcoming

[22:58] **kushti**: merge mined sidechain with private contracts, which is dark DeFi, right?

[23:04] **kushti**: And so, yeah, I think it's time to work on such things for Ergo, right?

[23:13] **kushti**: To provide, well, additional income for miners and also to, well, create more liquidity,

[23:25] **kushti**: Right, and also to play with new ideas without touching the main chain, which is quite stable.

[23:41] **kushti**: I think, well, it's actually

[23:45] **kushti**: stable for good rights and still there is a lot of unlocked potential right there in the Ergo and its contractual layer and block structure and so on.

[24:01] **kushti**: And well, there is some unlocked potential in regards with

[24:07] **kushti**: sidechains also, especially I mentioned my sidechains.

[24:12] **kushti**: So as shown in my submission for ErgoHack 8, there is possibility to have trustless two-way peg, right?

[24:24] **kushti**: Just using some contracts on Ergo and some actually quite small additions to the

[24:34] **kushti**: And then, yeah, we can actually do very different and interesting things there.

[24:42] **kushti**: So what I'm thinking about is to create some double merge mined sidechain.

[24:49] **kushti**: So Bitcoin and Ergo merge mined, right?

[24:55] **kushti**: Kind of ordering blocks, right, to be written on the Bitcoin blockchain and input blocks on the Ergo blockchain.

[25:10] **kushti**: Right, and then... Yeah, so with double commitments on both

[25:23] **kushti**: Blockchains, there is also possibility to somewhat DeFi for Bitcoin with quite trustless transfers.

[25:43] **kushti**: Well, with minimum trust assumptions.

[25:48] **kushti**: Then, yeah, well, those ideas of drive chain, so BIP 300301.

[25:57] **kushti**: would be helpful but so yeah we can go without them even so I mean that they would be helpful for a better peg for Bitcoin but here we can have also we can adopt some

[26:21] **kushti**: Well, techniques, others already working on and then reusing Ergo applications and also having trustless peg with Ergo blockchain, right.

[26:36] **kushti**: And then there could be different ideas tried also.

[26:42] **kushti**: So there are also other vectors which can be tried.

[26:48] **kushti**: So, for example, we may have some privacy-oriented

[26:56] **kushti**: I mentioned my sidechains, right?

[26:58] **kushti**: So recently, well, I started to dig into Zephyr, which is a jet protocol done on top of some fork of Monero.

[27:16] **kushti**: But yeah, it seems, well, you can do better, right?

[27:21] **kushti**: So you can have

[27:24] **kushti**: Merge mined sidechain with a variety of stablecoin protocol, even with one stablecoin protocol somehow.

[27:33] **kushti**: But you need to limit it somehow with better oracles because in case of Zephyr it seems it's just centralized oracle and here you can do oracle pools.

[27:45] **kushti**: But then you may have private transfers, right?

[27:49] **kushti**: Just using

[27:52] **kushti**: Well, ErgoMixer or adding also private amounts, right, so using more complicated cryptography, even FCMP from the upcoming Monero updates for full chain membership proofs and so on.

[28:11] **kushti**: So, you can do a dark DeFi based sidechain, right?

[28:18] **kushti**: So, have private contracts for ERGs, right?

[28:26] **kushti**: Possibility, right, to move transparent ERGs to the side chain, right, and then use them in dark contracts.

[28:40] **kushti**: So yeah, well, possibilities are quite

[28:43] **Armeanio**: Yeah, it opens up a lot of space for developers to play and underneath the network, it creates new increased revenue for miners potentially, which is always good for the security of a proof of work network, right?

[28:57] **kushti**: Yeah, for Ergo miners, but then, yeah, well, it could be interesting to Bitcoin miners as well, right, if it's about double-merge mined sidechain.

[29:08] **kushti**: There could be more options, for example, making a merge mined sidechain of Ergo, which is also a partner chain of Cardano.

[29:21] **kushti**: Two kinds of blocks validated by Ergo miners as well as Cardano validators.

[29:31] **kushti**: And also with the goal of trustless interoperability.

[29:40] **kushti**: And in case of Cardano, it would be even simpler to make it closer to, well, be fully trustless.

[29:52] **Armeanio**: Yeah, I think there's a lot of, let's say, green areas there to explore.

[29:57] **Armeanio**: I think that putting together some base tooling and some EIPs around, let's say, the implementation of merged mining opens up a lot of green space for quite a while, which would be great to see.

[30:16] **kushti**: Right.

[30:17] **kushti**: Then, yeah, there is the idea of dedicated sigma chains, right?

[30:22] **kushti**: Well, it's about not much merge mined chains, but chains with dedicated proof of work.

[30:30] **kushti**: With the idea to tame different classes of hardware and so on, right?

[30:37] **kushti**: Which also does make sense because, well, currently there is a lot of untamed computing power, I believe, right, in the form of ASICs.

[30:49] **Armeanio**: Even if you go on to like WhatToMine, you know, there are constantly new

[30:54] **Armeanio**: Chains that I don't know what they offer, but there people like to spec mine stuff that pops up So there's obviously hardware demand sitting around there.

[31:03] **Armeanio**: That's you know Somewhere to park and hopefully be profitable in the long term, which is always its own challenge and proof of work I guess but I Definitely think the capacity is growing.

[31:18] **Armeanio**: So the demand is there if there's kind of the economic

[31:24] **Armeanio**: Let's say a utility for directing that computing capacity somewhere.

[31:30] **Armeanio**: I do think proof of work is great at absorbing excess capacity.

[31:37] **Armeanio**: That's kind of its superpower, I guess.

[31:43] **kushti**: So, yeah, a lot of untamed computing power.

[31:49] **kushti**: Yeah, in ASICs and GPUs, right?

[31:51] **kushti**: And there will be more GPUs soon to be outdated, now used for AI.

[32:00] **kushti**: But then, yeah, well, there is need to tame the power.

[32:06] **kushti**: CPUs, some classes of CPUs probably not so well.

[32:14] **kushti**: suitable for Monero mining concern so yeah well a lot of possibilities here and well yeah instead of launching some new blockchain like another fork of Bitcoin with some well features which are not needed

[32:37] **kushti**: What people also doing some fork of fork of Kaspa, right?

[32:46] **kushti**: It was quite popular like one year ago to to launch some forks of forks of Kaspa.

[32:52] **kushti**: And so on.

[32:53] **kushti**: So yeah, it's it would be better to launch some.

[33:00] **kushti**: Well.

[33:03] **kushti**: Ergo similar sigma chain, right, with the idea to

[33:12] **kushti**: get rails with Ergo, and then Rosen Bridge since day one, so liquidity with all the chains, liquidity pools on Ethereum, Ergo, Binance Smart Chain, Cardano, and so on.

[33:32] **kushti**: And then also applications.

[33:35] **kushti**: Right.

[33:36] **kushti**: And then, yeah, you can do some experiments you want to do, well, in addition to a new kind of consensus, like taming new hardware.

[33:49] **kushti**: Yeah, you can also do something on the application layer.

[33:52] **kushti**: And yeah, so I think Merge Mined Sidechains is a low-hanging fruit, right?

[33:58] **kushti**: And well, from them, it will be quite clear how to extend

[34:04] **kushti**: The contractual layer in easiest way to introduce new features new contracts and so on Yeah, right.

[34:13] **kushti**: Maybe new Sigma protocols such as Yeah, yeah now have Some generalized Sigma protocols Suitable for a much more powerful things But yeah, maybe not so

[34:35] **kushti**: maybe not so efficient as what we have in Ergo.

[34:40] **kushti**: I mean, they have, but they're doing much more also.

[34:43] **kushti**: So, yeah, I mean, for concrete applications, it would be good to provide ways for developers to play with new features and to

[34:59] **kushti**: to open possibilities right to experiment in those areas now are inaccessible rights with other blockchains.

[35:09] **kushti**: So well, you cannot easily play with applications of

[35:17] **kushti**: Some newer sigma protocols, for example, by using EVM, right?

[35:23] **kushti**: But yeah, here in sigma contractual layer, it's more or less straightforward.

[35:35] **Armeanio**: Yeah, I do think that that long term opens up a lot of, I don't know, green area.

[35:41] **Armeanio**: You know, I'm excited.

[35:42] **Armeanio**: I think that's

[35:44] **Armeanio**: more or less the point of building kind of these open source contractual layers, open source applications.

[35:54] **Armeanio**: You know, some, I don't know, you watch like a sci-fi movie, right?

[35:58] **Armeanio**: You always see people kind of interacting with money on different devices having different energy inputs, different consensus models that are all

[36:07] **Armeanio**: more or less interoperable, right?

[36:11] **Armeanio**: And so, you know, to do that on top of clear security stacks is really fascinating to consider long term.

[36:22] **kushti**: Right, right, right.

[36:23] **kushti**: So yeah, and it would be also quite eco-friendly, right, to utilize outdated hardware for producing, well, money, basically, producing commodities, right?

[36:37] **kushti**: It's, I think, much better than, for example,

[36:46] **kushti**: I don't know, wasting huge pieces of land to extract gold and other metals, other commodities.

[36:57] **kushti**: Then we have a lot of tooling on upper levels such as

[37:08] **kushti**: ChainCash rights and other tools in addition to just non-DeFi tooling which is also there right like traditional DeFi tooling such as

[37:24] **kushti**: liquidity pools, LPs and auctions, lending pools, bonds and so on.

[37:37] **kushti**: So what do we have on Ergo?

[37:44] **kushti**: Well, valuable, right?

[37:46] **kushti**: So just imagine if you can run some Merge Mined sidechain, right, with shared liquidity, with the main ErgoChain since day one, with Rosen Bridge, and yeah, with some new features developers would like to experiment with, and yeah, with all those applications, so.

[38:11] **kushti**: Yeah, and with liquidity being created naturally, right?

[38:17] **kushti**: From block to block.

[38:21] **kushti**: Gradually unlocked, so it's not about launching, I don't know, memes or well, rugpull tokens, where owners of the token can dump.

[38:39] **kushti**: making price going down like minus 90% in one hour, like happened recently a few times with different VC rugpulls.

[38:50] **kushti**: So yeah, well, it's a much more natural story, right?

[38:56] **kushti**: And also beneficial to Ergo miners and to the Ergo ecosystem because of more liquidity rights going here and there to side chain or back to the main chain.

[39:15] **kushti**: So, yeah, well.

[39:17] **Armeanio**: Quite exciting.

[39:19] **Armeanio**: Yeah, I think you know more or less clear path towards that future, which is exciting, you know, sometimes in the I Don't know the cryptocurrency space.

[39:33] **Armeanio**: I think that like narratives consume reality, but they are sometimes not even based in reality and having like a

[39:43] **Armeanio**: clear engineering path towards like I guess how to put this together and what the benefits are pretty more or less like clear and straightforward which is always a little bit more useful than kind of the narratives that sometimes we hear around you know this ability to build like an open source

[40:09] **Armeanio**: financial operating system or application stack and then make it portable across let's say different chains or value inputs and that can all trustlessly talk to each other is a powerful goal long term I think.

[40:27] **Armeanio**: Especially if it's more, I don't know, clear from like pre-centralization, which is what we're seeing more and more and more in the space in my opinion.

[40:41] **Armeanio**: Instead of like decentralization, things are kind of come to market pre-centralized and then are supposed to go through some path where power is distributed.

[40:53] **Armeanio**: You know, oftentimes they either oligarchies form or, you know, that initial people just leave and then do it again, right?

[41:04] **kushti**: Yup, yup.

[41:05] **kushti**: Yeah, that's how meme coin clans are working, right?

[41:10] **kushti**: Often it's about a few people.

[41:15] **kushti**: They're launching meme coins one by one and promoting this nonsense, right?

[41:27] **kushti**: New meme coins, then rugpull, then yeah.

[41:31] **kushti**: And another guy from the clan is starting another rugpull.

[41:35] **Armeanio**: Narrative consumed to reality is what I call it, rather than having a clear foundation for a better reality.

[41:47] **kushti**: Yeah, at the same time, I see a huge request for a fair distribution right after all those rugpulls.

[41:56] **kushti**: Yeah, well, I don't know, maybe it's my bubble, but yeah, my crypto Twitter is full of that.

[42:03] **Armeanio**: Yeah, mine too, but I think we're in the same bubble.

[42:06] **Armeanio**: But I do think, if people take narrative and then they repeat it until it tries to become reality and then it's not reality, I think after enough rounds of experiencing that, it kind of disillusions people.

[42:25] **kushti**: Right, but yeah, I think there is trends indeed, right?

[42:29] **kushti**: So yeah, well, when people observe those nasty rugpulls and yeah, it's not something unknown, right?

[42:46] **kushti**: So the whole space works.

[42:52] **kushti**: And then there is a quite natural demand for fair distribution, right?

[42:59] **kushti**: And then, yeah, I mean, the problem of fair distribution was solved back in 2009, right?

[43:07] **kushti**: And it's proof of work.

[43:09] **kushti**: Yeah, no, I completely agree.

[43:13] **kushti**: Actually, this problem

[43:20] **kushti**: This problem existed before Bitcoin, right?

[43:23] **kushti**: With first digital cash schemes, like one done by Hal Finny, so it used proof of work, but didn't have difficulty.

[43:37] **kushti**: And then, yeah, well,

[43:42] **kushti**: Hal used some trusted hardware, but yeah, without difficulty still, yeah, so well, the distribution was in hands of, I don't know, the developers able to optimize their miners basically, right?

[44:00] **kushti**: I forgot the name, it was RPOW or something like that, HashCash.

[44:06] **kushti**: Yeah, so some pre-Bitcoin digital proof of work based currency, but without the Bitcoin emission schedule and difficulty recalculation rights, also the much needed part.

[44:26] **kushti**: of the equation.

[44:27] **kushti**: So yeah, and then the problem was solved, right, among others by Satoshi.

[44:37] **kushti**: And then people somehow lost it again.

[44:42] **kushti**: And now having all those things.

[44:45] **Armeanio**: I think there's just a desire to replicate the success of Bitcoin, but personally maximize profit potential from it.

[44:54] **Armeanio**: Call it what it is.

[44:55] **kushti**: Yeah, but yeah, I think actually, well, the ethos of Bitcoin is quite forgotten.

[45:03] **kushti**: So people are just launching digital tokens to grab some value from bigger fools basically.

[45:13] **Armeanio**: No, Bitcoin is taking on a life of its own these days, but I still think that like the initial, I don't know, roots of having like fair distribution of money and permissionless non-KYC anonymous or pseudo anonymous ability to participate in like a global network is still just as powerful as it was.

[45:36] **Armeanio**: It's just, yeah.

[45:42] **Armeanio**: Somewhat different let's just say that Um, yeah, yeah is what it is All right, so

[45:57] **kushti**: Yeah, so I think this is direction which we are discussing for some time, right?

[46:02] **kushti**: Probably for about one year.

[46:04] **kushti**: Yeah, one or two years we've been talking about this on the side.

[46:10] **kushti**: Now it's the time to jump on implementations and motivate people to implement.

[46:19] **Armeanio**: All those things.

[46:20] **Armeanio**: But anyway, I think that's kind of the natural progression for most things that we've seen on Ergo is they've been an idea that's talked about, discussed, debated, refined for like a year offline, and then we finally get the bandwidth or like time energy resources to do something in that direction.

[46:38] **Armeanio**: So I think that's somewhat natural.

[46:41] **kushti**: Yeah, but also, well, crystallization of ideas takes time.

[46:47] **kushti**: Yeah.

[46:47] **kushti**: Yeah.

[46:48] **kushti**: So, yeah, then it's quite natural, right?

[46:51] **kushti**: So, yeah, first there are discussions for many months and then, yeah, well, some action.

[47:01] **kushti**: This is how it's going with sub-blocks, right?

[47:07] **kushti**: So it's been discussed since 2023, something like that.

[47:15] **kushti**: But yeah, implementation is ongoing now.

[47:18] **kushti**: And yeah, it's quite good.

[47:20] **kushti**: So I think to the moment of releasing this video, there will be updated DevNet.

[47:31] **kushti**: And yeah, well, in somewhat July, we can think about injecting sub-block supporting nodes into the public testnet.

[47:45] **Armeanio**: Let's see.

[47:46] **Armeanio**: Let's see.

[47:46] **Armeanio**: Hopefully everybody out there that's tuning in can throw some mining power towards the public testnet when we get there.

[47:56] **Armeanio**: Yeah, it's just one of those things.

[47:58] **Armeanio**: We sit and we try to build and we watch the global debt increase at its own curve and inflation pop its head all across the globe and kind of this increasing march towards less economic freedom, more economic surveillance.

[48:16] **Armeanio**: I would say that sometimes the systems that I see pop up in the quote-unquote cryptocurrency space actually support the increase of debt and the absorption of inflation and don't necessarily enhance freedom.

[48:35] **Armeanio**: Maybe they enhance user experience, but on the surveillance side, it's a little sketchy.

[48:41] **Armeanio**: Hopefully, long term, we can build better money with better assumptions.

[48:46] **Armeanio**: that contributes to a better world.

[48:47] **Armeanio**: That's kind of the net goal, yeah?

[48:54] **kushti**: All right.

[48:54] **kushti**: So, yeah, stay tuned.

[48:59] **kushti**: A lot of news coming.

[49:02] **Armeanio**: All right, everybody.

[49:03] **Armeanio**: Happy Ergoversary.

[49:05] **kushti**: Happy Ergoversary.
