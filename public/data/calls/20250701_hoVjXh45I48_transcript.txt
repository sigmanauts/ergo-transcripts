[00:13] **AI**: Hello everyone.

[00:15] **AI**: Today I'm excited to present PandaVee, a project that combines blockchain technology with modern access control.

[00:25] **AI**: Introducing the PandaVee project.

[00:28] **AI**: We've built a blockchain-based access control system powered by the Ergo blockchain.

[00:33] **AI**: Each user's entry rights are verified using a unique token ID, replacing traditional cards or passwords with a secure on-chain identity.

[00:42] **AI**: Every access event is immutably recorded on the blockchain, ensuring full transparency, traceability, and tamper-proof security.

[00:51] **AI**: Whether it's for office buildings, event venues, or smart doors, PandaVee offers a secure, modern, and reliable solution for access management.

[01:00] **AI**: In this video, we'll show you how we use the Ergonode and ErgoPay to activate our Arduino-based hardware and unlock the door, live and on-chain.

[01:17] **AI**: Start the Ergonode and PandaVee server.

[02:13] **AI**: Release build PandaVee app to Android mobile phone.

[02:37] **AI**: Plug in module and compiling upload PandaVee sketch.

[03:24] **AI**: Arduino version and Wiegand version will be integrated.

[03:33] **AI**: Here is what we're using and we'll take a minute to build up our Arduino access control system.

[05:42] **AI**: First, power up our system.

[05:53] **AI**: Open PandaVee mobile app.

[05:56] **AI**: Log in using ErgoPay signing.

[06:02] **AI**: Session ID will be recorded in PandaVee server.

[06:05] **AI**: Here is list of NFT tokens from this Ergo wallet.

[06:10] **AI**: Click token to generate QR, binding session ID with wallet address for this weekend.

[06:17] **AI**: Scan the token QR code.

[06:21] **AI**: Server will determine if this QR is valid, then access granted, gate or door will open.

[06:28] **AI**: Transaction will be pushed and submitted to Ergo blockchain.

[06:37] **AI**: All transaction IDs can be checked at Ergo Explorer.

[06:41] **AI**: More mobile app functions will be made in the next coming video, next enhancement.

[06:47] **AI**: We'll integrate database records and improve mobile app functions.

[06:55] **AI**: Integrate with some more access products and hardware.

[07:04] **AI**: We're still working hard to learn both hardware and software.

[07:08] **AI**: Hope everyone still supports Ergo and us.

[07:13] **AI**: Thanks Ergo and all friends that we got a chance to step into blockchain technology and wish everyone happy Ergo anniversary.
