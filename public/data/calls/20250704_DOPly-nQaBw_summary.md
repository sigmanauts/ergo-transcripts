# Ergo Community Call: Rosen Bridge Update
**Date:** July 4, 2025  
**Participants:** Joseph Armeanio (Rosen Bridge Creator), tmr.erg (Host)  
**Context:** Ergoversary 2025 Summit Content

## Executive Summary

This community call provided an in-depth overview of Rosen Bridge, one of Ergo's most successful dApps. Joseph Armeanio explained how Rosen was designed to solve the fundamental problem of permissioned market access in crypto, where projects must pay millions to exchanges and comply with restrictive terms that often conflict with blockchain principles. Rather than using traditional mint-and-burn bridge mechanics that create infinite risk, Rosen employs a lock-and-unlock system with dual-layer security: a reporting layer of "watchers" who audit transactions and create consensus before execution, followed by a multi-sig execution layer.

The bridge currently secures over 3 million ERG across 40+ tokens spanning Ergo, Cardano, Ethereum, and newly added Binance Smart Chain. Armeanio emphasized that Rosen was built for long-term resilience rather than speed, designed to withstand state-level attacks and survive the "100-year flood" scenarios that have destroyed other bridges. The system distributes profits to hundreds of community watchers rather than extracting value, creating a self-sustaining economic model that grows stronger over time.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Bridge Security Philosophy**: Rosen uses lock-and-unlock vaults instead of mint-and-burn to eliminate infinite mint risk, with transparent 1:1 asset backing that users can audit

• **Dual-Layer Architecture**: Reporting layer (watchers) creates "pre-truth" consensus before execution layer processes transactions, preventing post-mortem discovery of exploits

• **Community Incentive Model**: Hundreds of watchers earn profit distribution from bridge fees, creating economic incentives for security and adoption

• **Market Independence**: Rosen provides "backdoor" access to liquidity without exchange listing fees (which can reach $10M) or regulatory compliance requirements

• **Cross-Chain Strategy**: Focus on connecting technically sophisticated but market-disadvantaged chains (Nervos, Alephium, Kaspa) rather than competing in crowded EVM space

• **Future Development**: 2025 priorities include wallet SDK integration, potential Layer 2 speed solutions via liquidity providers, and stress-testing with privacy coins like Monero

• **Current Scale**: Rosen now holds liquidity equivalent to major exchanges at fraction of listing costs, with 3M+ ERG and 40+ supported tokens

## Decisions Made

• Wallet integration SDK development is prioritized for 2025 to reduce user friction
• DogeChain integration expected within approximately two weeks, serving as documentation template for Bitcoin forks
• Monero integration planned as deliberate stress test of system's regulatory resilience

## Notable Quotes

> "My base rule in bridge design is, okay, we want to not rehypothecate assets. Just that simple. We want to keep everything one-to-one in a way that's transparent, auditable. Any user can check that." - **Joseph Armeanio**

> "How can we navigate those type of attacks without losing our tether to larger markets? So, Rosen is kind of an ongoing attempt to harden, you know, make Ergo hard to kill, basically." - **Joseph Armeanio**

> "I think that profit distribution is the greatest power of blockchain, right? That's its superpower and unfortunately, I think more and more we're seeing profit extraction being used as the superpower of blockchain, which is backwards." - **Joseph Armeanio**
