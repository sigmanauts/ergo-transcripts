# Ergo PoW Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Call Title:** Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA - June 12th

## Executive Summary

This community call featured a rare appearance by Joe Armeanio (surprise guest thanks to his dog waking him up early), along with regular hosts qx() and kushti. The discussion covered several major developments including plans for an upcoming Ergo community meetup event, progress on Rosen Bridge expansion to new chains like Doge and Runes, and significant technical updates on Ergo's development roadmap including the pending 6.0 release and sub-blocks implementation.

Key themes included the philosophy of execution over marketing, challenges with centralized exchange gatekeeping, and the potential for Ergo's unique features like storage rent and merge-mined sidechains to create sustainable security models. The team emphasized building solid infrastructure first before focusing on promotion, contrasting their approach with the broader crypto industry's tendency toward hype-driven development.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Community Meetup Planning**: Joe and qx() organizing an Ergo event with confirmed speakers including MiGoreng, Allison, and others, focusing on low barrier to entry compared to expensive crypto conferences
• **Rosen Bridge Expansion**: Working on Runes and Doge integration, with Doge proving challenging due to strict rate limits and poor infrastructure tooling
• **New Chain Discussions**: Ongoing talks with Zano, Kaspa and other chains about Rosen integration, exploring incentive models for maintenance

• **Sub-blocks Development**: Continued optimization work, planning public testnet deployment in July
• **Sigma Chains Refactoring**: Published plans for merge-mined sidechains, described as "not much work" to implement

## Notable Quotes

**Joe Armeanio on crypto market priorities**: "It's like, let's delist Zcash, which has really done some great work in terms of research and cryptography and kind of like the execution side. And then it's like, hey, let's list fart coin. And that kind of tells you the incentives and the alignment are screwy as hell."

**Joe Armeanio on development philosophy**: "I've been in crypto too long where it's like your white paper and your marketing is cheap, execute. You know, and then you have something that, you know, if it's done well, you know, it'll last."

**kushti on Ergo's unique economics**: "Even more in the long term, a big market cap of tokens also does mean a big amount of storage rent, which is increasing security actually. So here is dynamics may be different from other blockchains because of storage rent."
