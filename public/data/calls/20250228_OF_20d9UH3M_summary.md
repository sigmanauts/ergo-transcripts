## Notable Quotes

> "So, well, it's now maybe... Well, the best representation of this core, right, could be some kind of informal alliance, right, and then there is actually some marketing group, well, existing, just to think, such as Sigmanauts, right, some private groups, but it actually has a lot of people from community, like 60 or 70." - **kushti** on ecosystem organization

> "I mean, it's just like tools, right, what we do have in DeFi, I believe. And, well, it's now time, as there are enough tools, to go outside and, well, to become a reserve asset for different calibers from small communities to, well, as it's permissionless, right, and then you can expect big players." - **kushti** on real-world adoption

> "But the global idea of cryptocurrencies and blockchains, I still see the narrative is still even from people like Michael Saylor... that Bitcoin is digital gold and Bitcoin is the investment. At no point do I hear the narrative ever shifted to, you know, this is a utility and here's how we can layer onto this and build more utility." - **qx()** on industry narrative challenges
