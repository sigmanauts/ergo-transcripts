# Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA - July 17th, 2025

**Call Date:** July 18, 2025  
**Duration:** ~58 minutes  
**Participants:** kushti (Ergo founder), qx() (Community member)

## Executive Summary

The weekly community call focused heavily on Ergo 6.0 development progress and upcoming sub-blocks implementation. kushti reported that voting for Ergo 6.0 shows 90+ percent support, with activation expected around October 2025. The team is preparing for public testnet mining with sub-blocks support in July, followed by a whitepaper for the first merge-mined sidechain. Key infrastructure developments include the InfraDAO proposal gaining traction with 4-5 initial participants ready to run distributed nodes globally, and ongoing work on ChainCash requiring real-world use case identification.

The discussion also covered Rosen Bridge initiatives, with five community proposals currently open for discussion on Paideia, including airdrops to increase Cardano wallet holders and potentially meet Kraken's listing requirements. Development efforts continue on multiple fronts including Hummingbot integration for community-run liquidity pools, GitCircles for rewarding open-source contributions, and exploration of double merge-mining capabilities with Bitcoin.
