      "asker": "Marc the Shark",
      "answer": "Clearer indication of liquidation risks, better information dashboards like Balancer on Ethereum where you could create multi-asset pools with custom proportions, filtering capabilities for loans in apps like SigmaFi, and bidirectional proposals (both loan requests and lend requests). The goal is having all the information needed to make decisions readily available in a polished dashboard.",

      "asker": "tim.erg",
      "answer": "We need to get to the point where people don't realize they're using the blockchain. Users should feel like they're just doing banking or using a business application they need, not feeling like a hacker. The interface should be trustworthy and reputable without excessive crypto theming.",

      "asker": "Marc the Shark",
      "answer": "Users interacting with both chains will realize it costs about 1% on Ergo compared to Ethereum fees. On Ethereum, you have to be very sure of your actions because it costs $17 per transaction, making it only worthwhile for large positions. On Ergo, you can easily adjust positions, try different strategies, and experiment due to much lower transaction costs.",

      "asker": "Marc the Shark",
      "answer": "Privacy is optional on Ergo, which is probably the most widely usable approach for building something for everyone. Monero is private by design in the core protocol, which is simpler for users but mandatory. On Ergo, you have to download a mixer frontend and follow specific steps, creating a barrier. Both approaches serve different needs - optional privacy for general use, mandatory privacy for those who specifically need it.",

      "asker": "tim.erg",
      "answer": "Monero holders could bridge their Monero to Ergo to access proper DeFi services like borrowing against their Monero holdings. This capability isn't quite possible on Monero itself, so Ergo could serve as a DeFi hub for privacy-focused assets through cross-chain bridges.",

      "asker": "tim.erg",
      "answer": "Through apps like Ergo Lend (EXLE), people in Kenya regularly take out 0% loans, pay them back, and take new ones, creating a cycle of financial access. This demonstrates the power of blockchain to provide financial services to underserved populations. There are also users like Riro in Mumbai who represent the human side of this global financial inclusion.",

      "asker": "tim.erg",
      "answer": "LETS is like a circular economy dApp for small communities, similar to ChainCash but more localized. It could serve a village or small group that needs an accounting system, where tokens could be backed by something and used for local transactions. It's an old concept but now implementable with blockchain technology, requiring just minimal internet access.",
