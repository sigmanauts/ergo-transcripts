# Ergo Community Call Summary
**Date:** July 2, 2025  
**Title:** SigmaFi | tmr.erg | Ergoversary 2025

## Executive Summary

This community call featured tmr.erg presenting SigmaFi as part of the Ergo Summit video collection, highlighting it as one of Ergo's cornerstone applications. SigmaFi is a peer-to-peer lending protocol built on the Ergo blockchain that enables users to create collateralized loan requests without intermediaries. The platform operates as autonomous code where borrowers create loan requests with their own terms and collateral, while lenders can choose to fulfill these requests based on transparent terms including APR, collateral ratios, and loan duration.

tmr.erg demonstrated the platform's functionality, explaining how it serves as both a risk management tool and a way for users to gain leverage on their ERG holdings. The presenter emphasized SigmaFi's elegance in solving real-world financial needs through blockchain technology, noting its transparency, low fees (approximately 1% or ~$4), and automatic execution including liquidation mechanisms. Despite its functionality, the presenter noted relatively low adoption, with only six over-collateralized loan requests active at the time of the call.
