We need to keep the current miner intact and add another one with sub-blocks generation to test how things work. Based on testing results, we'll plan mainnet activation along with needed security audits.",

The contracts are flexible enough to be updated annually or as needed.",

      "answer": "Any of the 8 million assets on Base would be tradable on Coinbase. This means we could get Rosen ERG listed there, though we'd need to find liquidity providers. It's similar to listing Cardano assets on Kraken - it could provide attractive onramp/offramp options and trading for liquidity providers, potentially giving us another US trading option in a few months.",
