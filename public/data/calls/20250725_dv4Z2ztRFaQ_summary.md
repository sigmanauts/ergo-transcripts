# Ergo Blockchain Community Call - July 25, 2025

## Executive Summary

The Ergo community held a weekly update and AMA session focused on technical developments and future roadmap discussions. Key highlights included progress updates on sub-blocks/sigma chains for horizontal scaling, advances in privacy technology with "dark tokens" using encrypted amounts, and several community-driven projects reaching completion or near-completion phases. The discussion emphasized Ergo's UTXO-based advantages over account-based blockchain models, particularly regarding intents and account abstraction capabilities that have been native to Ergo since inception.

Technical developments dominated the conversation, with kushti presenting ideas for global transfer policies and dark token implementations, while Armeanio discussed long-term sustainability challenges for proof-of-work networks and potential solutions through horizontal scaling. Community projects showed significant momentum, with MGPai's SigmaLock nearing completion after extensive backend development, and HQ announcing a new simple token locking application released just hours before the call.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Sub-blocks/Sigma Chains Development**: Discussion of horizontal scaling solutions to address proof-of-work sustainability challenges and value leakage to layer-2 solutions

• **Privacy Technology**: Introduction of "dark tokens" concept using encrypted amounts and global transfer policies for enhanced privacy features

• **SigmaLock Project Update**: MGPai reported near-completion of inheritance/time-lock application with custom Go-based indexing framework and mempool support

• **Rosen Bridge Evolution**: Progress toward competitive federation model and integration with trading platforms like Hummingbot for improved liquidity management

• **Keystone Wallet Integration**: 4-6 week timeline provided for complete Ergo support with Nautilus wallet integration

• **Community Tools**: New simple locking application released by HQ, discussion of Nautilus multi-chain capabilities, and plans for expanded merchandise payment options

• Plans established for continued weekly community Zoom calls during Andy's absence
• Agreement to explore adding Mew token payment options to merchandise platforms
• Initiative to create more accessible GitHub issue reporting for non-technical users

## Notable Quotes

**kushti on Ergo's design philosophy**: "I think Ergo by design... it's not just intents friendly, it's intents oriented right so well you are specifying well, for following good design patterns, right, so you are specifying only conditions which do matter, right, and leave the rest to others."

**Armeanio on proof-of-work sustainability**: "Long term, there's kind of a question in terms of the economic sustainability of that model, right? You know, after we see a couple of halvings, the miner reward from the blocks is on its own cascade downward."

**HQ on development speed**: "Yeah. I think some people take one year to build it. I just take one day." (Referring to his new locking application versus more complex projects)
