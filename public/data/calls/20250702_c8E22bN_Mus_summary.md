# Ergo Community Call Summary
**Date:** July 2, 2025  
**Title:** Bene Fundraising Platform | Josemi | Ergoversary 2025

## Executive Summary

Josemi presented Bene (also referred to as "Beene"), a proof-of-funding platform built on the Ergo blockchain that enables projects to raise funds while automatically distributing proof-of-funding tokens to contributors. The platform operates as a crowdfunding mechanism where project owners create funding vaults with specific parameters including funding goals, deadlines, and token distribution rates, while contributors receive voucher tokens that can be exchanged for proof-of-funding tokens if goals are met or refunded if they are not.

The platform has already been successfully used for real projects, including raising 5,000 ERG for Gluon Gold's SDK development. Bene offers built-in protection for contributors through its refund mechanism when minimum funding goals aren't reached by deadlines, making it suitable for various use cases including donations, crowdfunding, startup funding, event ticketing, and collaborative project funding.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Platform Mechanics**: Detailed explanation of how funding vaults work, including minimum goals, deadlines, and automatic token distribution
• **Real-world Implementation**: Successful case study of Gluon Gold fundraising that raised 5,000 ERG for SDK development
• **Risk Mitigation**: Built-in refund mechanism protects contributors when projects fail to reach minimum funding goals
• **Multiple Use Cases**: Platform flexibility supports donations, crowdfunding, startup funding, event tickets, and collaborative projects
• **Technical Implementation**: Web application running with observers in browser, connecting directly to Ergo blockchain for fault tolerance
• **Live Demonstration**: Real-time creation and testing of a demo project showing the complete funding workflow
• **Open Source Availability**: Implementations available on both Ethereum and Ergo, with code accessible on GitHub

## Decisions Made

• Platform is ready for community use with working implementations on Ergo blockchain
• Both Ethereum and Ergo versions are open source and available for public access
• Community encouraged to follow social media channels and engage for potential collaboration

## Notable Quotes

> **Josemi**: "Beene enables any project to receive funding from the community and automatically distributes proof of funding tokens to contributors in real time. These tokens serve as contribution accounting tokens, providing who contributed and how much."

> **Josemi**: "So thanks to Beene's rules, because the minimum amount of 5 million ERGs was not raised after the deadline, contributors can return their proof of funding tokens, the SuperDuper Blockchain Token, and get their ERG back."

> **Josemi**: "This idea of working together on different projects and where labor and capital to these projects are both rewarded equally with contribution accounting tokens."
