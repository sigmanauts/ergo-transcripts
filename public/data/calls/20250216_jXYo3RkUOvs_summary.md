# Ergo PoW Dev Update - February 16, 2025

## Executive Summary

The 130th Ergo development update highlighted significant progress across multiple areas of the ecosystem, with particular emphasis on wallet improvements, stablecoin developments, and sub-blocks implementation. Host qx() emphasized Ergo's resilience during market downturns, noting that the platform has over 30-40 active projects and robust financial tools for experimentation, making it less dependent on speculative money flows compared to other blockchain ecosystems.

Key developments include the release of Client 5.0.25 with enhanced node indexing, Sigma SDK 5.0.15 with new execution capabilities, and successful voting for version 6.0 activation on public testnet. The Oracle operators successfully completed an update ceremony for SigmaUSD, enabling the transition to Oracle version 2 with the introduction of DORT (Dollar Oracle Reward Token) alongside the existing GORT for Dexy Gold.

## Notable Quotes

• **kushti**: "We don't need sub-blocks. You know, we have at the moment, you don't have to wait for sub-blocks. We have many financial tools for experimentation."

• **qx()**: "When the market fluctuates, when CoinGecko makes my portfolio bleed and cry a little bit, it doesn't bother me because I know that I know why we're here. I know what we've built and I know what we can build."

• **qx()**: "A majority of small users compared to one big user always makes that big difference."
