# Ergo PoW Blockchain Weekly AMA - May 8th, 2025

## Executive Summary

This weekly Ergo community call featured core developer kushti and community member qx() discussing recent releases, upcoming developments, and community proposals. Major topics included the release of node versions 5.0.26 and 5.1.3, progress on the upcoming 6.0 release with voting expected by end of May, and significant developments in sub-blocks implementation for faster transaction processing. The discussion also covered Rosen Bridge treasury proposals aimed at increasing adoption and liquidity.

Kushti provided updates on various real-world asset tokenization discussions, mesh network implementations for offline payments, and ongoing work with communities in Africa for cooperative funding. The conversation highlighted the philosophical differences between current "Web3" implementations and what kushti believes should be true decentralized systems focused on utility rather than token speculation.

## Notable Quotes

**kushti**: "I believe it should be about Web3, but not that Web3, which is considered now in the blockchain industry. When some use case and then issue token and then hype and then run."

**kushti**: "Proper web3 is about, I believe, 99% of use cases. There is no need for tokens, right, in the first place... it should be about mesh networks, Nostr services, IPFS services, distributed decentralized peer-to-peer systems."

**qx()**: "Think of it as we're utilizing funds we didn't have before, essentially given to us by running a guard service... and then we can take these funds and actually do something good to either help us get listed on Kraken, get adoption of Rosen ERG, bolster the liquidity pool."
