# Ergo PoW Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** June 20, 2025  
**Title:** Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA - June 19th

## Executive Summary

This community call focused primarily on the imminent release of Ergo node version 6.0, with kushti announcing that the final release would likely occur on the same day as the call. The update represents a significant soft fork that will require mining pool coordination, as it's the first major update since 2022. Additionally, the team discussed ongoing development of sub-blocks technology, which could be deployed by the end of 2025, and various ecosystem updates including Rosen Bridge's upcoming Dogecoin integration and preparations for Ergo's anniversary celebration on July 1st.

The call also covered broader blockchain topics including stablecoin development, privacy considerations for DEX implementations, and the growing role of AI in coding within the Ergo ecosystem. Community engagement was emphasized, particularly regarding voting on Paideia proposals for exchange listings, with speakers noting low participation rates despite high interest expressed in chats.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Ergo 6.0 Release**: Final release planned for the day of the call, with instructions for mining pools to follow
