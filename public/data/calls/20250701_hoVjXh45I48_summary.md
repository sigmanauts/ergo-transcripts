# Ergo Community Call Summary - July 1, 2025

## Executive Summary

This community call featured the presentation of PandaVee, an innovative blockchain-based access control system built on the Ergo blockchain. The project demonstrates how traditional physical access control can be revolutionized using blockchain technology, replacing conventional cards and passwords with secure, on-chain identity verification through unique token IDs. The presentation included a live demonstration of the system in action, showing how users can authenticate through an Android mobile app using ErgoPay signing and NFT tokens to unlock Arduino-controlled hardware doors.

The PandaVee team showcased their complete end-to-end solution, from mobile app authentication to hardware integration, with all access events being immutably recorded on the Ergo blockchain for transparency and tamper-proof security. This project represents a practical real-world application of Ergo's blockchain technology, bridging the gap between digital assets and physical world interactions while celebrating Ergo's anniversary.
