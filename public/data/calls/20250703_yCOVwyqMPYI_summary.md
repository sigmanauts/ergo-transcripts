# Ergo Community Call Summary
**Date:** July 3, 2025  
**Topic:** Gluon Update | Bruno | Ergoversary 2025

## Executive Summary

Bruno provided a comprehensive update on Gluon, Ergo's autonomous gold-backed stablecoin protocol, during this Ergoversary celebration call. The presentation highlighted significant progress across multiple fronts, including a successful independent security audit by Krasavice Blazen that found no vulnerabilities, and substantial advancement in mathematical proofs with five out of six stability theorems now proven. The team has also completed formal verification work in Coq, though this proved more time-intensive than initially expected.

The most user-facing improvement is the release of a new beta frontend for Gluon Gold (available at gluon.gold), which eliminates backend dependencies for greater decentralization, provides enhanced fee transparency, and includes a comprehensive dashboard displaying key protocol metrics like reserve ratio, total value locked, and trading volume. The new interface also features a more familiar swap-style user experience that the community had been requesting.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Security Audit Results**: Independent audit by Krasavice Blazen completed with no vulnerabilities found, including both code inspection and protocol simulation
• **Research Progress**: Five of six intended stability theorems proven, with the sixth nearly complete
• **Formal Verification**: Coq formal verification underway, requiring approximately 1000 lines of code per theorem proof
• **Academic Submission**: Plans to submit complete Gluon paper to the first Stability Workshop
• **Frontend Overhaul**: New beta frontend launched with improved decentralization, transparency, and user experience
• **Protocol Metrics**: Dashboard now displays critical information including reserve ratio, TVL, and volume data

## Decisions Made

• Replaced the old frontend with the new beta version despite remaining issues due to significant improvements
• Committed to submitting the Gluon research paper to the first Stability Workshop (organized by Bruno)
• Continued focus on completing formal verification proofs in Coq
