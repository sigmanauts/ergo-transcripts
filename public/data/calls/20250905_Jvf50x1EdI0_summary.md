# Ergo Community Call Summary - September 5th, 2025

## Executive Summary

This inaugural community AMA marked a transition from traditional developer updates to an interactive format where community members could directly engage with core developers. The call featured significant technical updates on sub-blocks development, ChainCash/Basis payment systems, and Rosen bridge enhancements. kushti provided detailed insights into his work on peer-to-peer layer improvements and the innovative Git Circles project for rewarding open-source contributors with community tokens. The discussion also covered practical infrastructure expansion with new peer nodes being deployed across the USA.

A major portion of the call focused on ChainCash and the new off-chain payment system called Basis, which aims to enable fractional reserve banking with transparent collateralization levels. This sparked an engaging discussion about using silver as a unit of account for local community economies, highlighting Ergo's potential for real-world monetary applications beyond traditional cryptocurrency use cases.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Sub-blocks Development**: kushti reported heavy rework of peer-to-peer layer with INV messaging implementation, currently testing with three-peer network
• **ChainCash/Basis Payment System**: New off-chain payment design using minimally trusted trackers, enabling microtransactions and credit systems
• **Silver-backed Community Currencies**: Discussion of using tokenized silver for local economies, leveraging America's historical silver coinage
• **Git Circles Project**: Community currency system rewarding developers with tokens for code contributions, nearly ready for testing
• **Rosen Bridge Updates**: Integration of runes support, testing phases, and potential Bitcoin Lightning Network compatibility
• **Infrastructure Expansion**: Three new peer nodes deploying to improve USA coverage, seeking European/Asian participants
• **Developer Onboarding Tools**: Plans for MCP servers and AI-powered documentation to help new developers
• **Hardware Wallet Development**: Progress on open-source DIY hardware wallets that can be assembled at home
• **Upcoming Events**: Korean Blockchain Week attendance and Colorado meetup planning

## Decisions Made

• kushti will write high-level documentation for the new ChainCash Basis design
• Tyler and kushti to continue development discussions in developer channels
• Infrastructure expansion to proceed with three new peer deployments
• Community to explore silver tokenization documentation for local economies
• AI-powered developer tools project to move forward after infrastructure priorities

## Notable Quotes

**kushti**: "I think that the current crypto industry, let's say, so yeah, it's creating tokens, means money, where it's not needed usually, right, but not creating where it's needed. So it's kind of reversed to the needs of digital and real-world economies."

**Grayman**: "I think [ChainCash is] the most exciting thing going on, not just in Ergo, but in crypto in general. I don't know if anybody else is even contemplating this type of thing."

**kushti**: "From my experience, yeah, by number of codes, so yeah, off-chain is like 20 times well more code so even more right... that's an interesting topic i'm also thinking a lot these days like how to organize development"
