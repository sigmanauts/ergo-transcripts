      "answer": "The devnet testing spans good geographic distance with Sydney nodes in German data centers and Potato likely in America. This creates a good test environment, though the devnet is quite extreme with blocks every 30 seconds and 60 sub-blocks per block, meaning two sub-blocks per second.",

It has a Git bot and persistence layer already done, with the next steps being a GitHub application and Ergo blockchain integration. The plan is to test it manually first, then do airdrops to existing developer communities.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "Open source communities already act as DAOs off-chain with maintainers and rules for merging code. While technically possible, governance in open source is complex - even projects like Linux still depend heavily on single leaders like Linus Torvalds after 30 years. Off-chain governance structures may actually be more flexible than on-chain DAOs.",

This creates significant friction compared to simple Apple Pay donations. The accessibility issue makes Ergo feel like a scarce resource rather than an accessible tool.",

This is achievable but requires development. Currently HodlCoin has VoltPay but doesn't support Apple Pay yet, and Banxa is the best option for US users.",
