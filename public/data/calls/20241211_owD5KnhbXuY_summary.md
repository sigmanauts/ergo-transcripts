# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary

**Call Date:** December 11, 2024  
**Call Title:** ONERGO | Kropli | ErgoHack 9

## Executive Summary

Team Kropli presented their ErgoHack 9 project "On-Ergo," a comprehensive ecosystem hub designed to address the growing complexity of navigating blockchain ecosystems. Drawing lessons from Cardano's rapid growth challenges, the team aims to create a proactive solution for Ergo before it faces similar overwhelming expansion. On-Ergo combines four key components: an event calendar, educational platform, Discord bot integration, and community incentives to create a unified platform for both newcomers and experienced users.

The platform addresses critical barriers to blockchain adoption, particularly the complexity that keeps most crypto investors from withdrawing funds from centralized exchanges. Through gamified learning quests, centralized event management, and automated Discord integration, On-Ergo seeks to transform the user experience from intimidating to engaging, guiding users from "newbie to Sigmanauts" through structured, rewarded learning paths.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Problem identification**: Cardano's ecosystem became overwhelming as it grew, with no centralized way to track developments and events
• **Target audience**: Both newcomers scared of making costly mistakes and experienced users needing better information aggregation
• **Event calendar functionality**: Centralized listing of community meetups, dApp launches, updates, and special events with community-driven additions
• **Educational platform design**: Quest-based roadmap system with rewards for completing learning milestones (wallet creation, first transactions, dApp integration)
• **Discord bot integration**: Automated event management with slash commands and potential AI-powered announcement parsing
• **Incentive systems**: Leaderboards, raffles, and rewards to encourage community participation and engagement
• **Decentralization approach**: Plans to open-source the project and implement decentralized event posting permissions through NFTs or Discord integration
• **Development roadmap**: Starting with event calendar and Discord bot, then expanding to educational quests and enhanced incentives

## Decisions Made

• Development will begin with essential features (event calendar and Discord bot) before expanding to educational components
• The project will be open-sourced in later phases to enable community contributions
• Multiple solutions for event posting permissions are being explored, including Discord bot integration and NFT-based access
• The platform will integrate with existing Ergo ecosystem Discord servers for automated event detection
