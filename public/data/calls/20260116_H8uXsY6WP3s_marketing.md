# Marketing Content Extract: Ergo AI Coding Community Call

---

### 1. Twitter Thread (5-7 tweets)

**Tweet 1:** 🧵 AI is transforming blockchain development, and @ergoplatform_ is leading the way. Our latest community call showcased unstoppable dApps, AI-powered smart contract auditing, and how developers are building entire applications in hours, not months.

**Tweet 2:** @qx_ergo demonstrated fully decentralized apps hosted on IPFS - a reporting system, Twitter-like social platform, and encrypted messaging - all built with AI assistance and running without central servers. True unstoppable infrastructure.

**Tweet 3:** Smart contract security gets an AI boost: @kushti_ru showed how LLMs can audit ErgoScript contracts by catching common developer mistakes like unchecked registers and double-spending vulnerabilities. Much simpler than auditing EVM contracts.

**Tweet 4:** The developer onboarding barrier is collapsing. @Fitz noted: "I honestly had a hard time setting up a node before. Now I just feel like I can vibe code whatever I'd like... an entry barrier has been decreased."

**Tweet 5:** @hq_nft added bulk buying/selling to MewMart NFT marketplace - 60% AI-coded frontend with drag-and-drop functionality. Plus mobile dApp integration for in-wallet swapping without visiting external sites.

**Tweet 6:** 100x more developers = fundamentals matter more than ever. As @kushti_ru said: "You need solid foundations and principles... ideas should be sound economically and monetarily."

**Tweet 7:** The AI coding revolution is here, but quality still matters. Join our dev chat to learn, build, and shape the future of decentralized applications. Full transcript: [link]
