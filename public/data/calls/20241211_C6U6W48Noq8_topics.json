      "primary_speaker": "Marc the Shark",
      "summary": "Marc introduces the Mining Rights Protocol (MRP), a mineral rights inspired system for blockchain mining that uses NFT-enhanced mining privileges and rights-based token distribution. The system allows miners to buy rights tokens that grant them the ability to emit specific tokens when they find blocks, creating a dual reward system on top of Ergo.",
