[00:14] **kushti**: Hello everyone.

[00:15] **qx()**: Hi everybody. Welcome to the, what do we call it, kushti, we're calling it the Ergo ecosystem weekly AMA?

[00:26] **kushti**: Yeah, so I had some discussions with folks, well, Sigmanauts we had in Hong Kong, our consensus Hong Kong event, and yeah, well, it seems, you know, like Ergo AMA does sound quite strange, I mean, considering that I mean, it's a protocol, right, and the assets are not controlled. And, well, there is no any party, right, which can represent itself as Ergo, then the question is what does Ergo mean. So, well, Ergo ecosystem is then quite better, right, in this regard. Just a word game, maybe. But yeah, well, there is such feedback.

[01:22] **qx()**: All right. That sounds good to me. We put it on the poster this week. We'll see how it flies. But it does make sense. There's no. Right. I mean, we have the EF as the official Ergo Foundation entity, but from there it's all ecosystem people that broadcast here and do this. You're not part of the EF. I'm not part of the EF. Dan, I think still an advisor, but yeah.

[01:50] **kushti**: And also it's not official entities. So, I mean, it was established not to control the protocol, right? So, well, it's vision document which I composed with the help of MX, I believe, and some other folks back in 2019. So, yeah, it's not saying that this entity is, well, controlling the protocol and this entity is official. I mean, there is no such word everywhere. At least we didn't make it because, I mean, it's also quite confusing. I mean, what does it mean, official?

[02:26] **kushti**: So, what's... I mean, when you're talking about something official, that does mean some compliance and, well, responsibility, right, and then control, but, yeah, well, I don't think Ergo Foundation has control to start with, and then, yeah, it doesn't make sense to tell about other things such as responsibility and compliance and so on. It was designed this way. It was never considered as official, at least when it was established.

[03:19] **kushti**: At some point I also removed the words official repository, because it's the same problem. What does it mean, official code repository? The term is not quite clear. And also, you know, the problem is that in Git, you can fork the code. And there are like tens, maybe hundreds of forks of Ergo repository over GitHub. And you can find words official repository in those 100 repositories around GitHub. And that doesn't make any sense. So, well, this should be attributed outside, but then, yeah, it's the same question. I mean, what makes this repository official? What does the term mean even?

[04:19] **qx()**: What'd you rename the GitHub to? Did you have DAO in there at all? Like the ergo-dev-dao-github repository for that stuff?

[04:25] **kushti**: No, no, so it's ergo-platform, but yeah, well, the repository is just... So it wasn't the node code repository, so it's now just saying what it is, right? So, well, it's the node code, well, yeah, so, well, it's the initial implementation, right, so, well, to be considered as a reference for further implementations, like Sigma Rust, for example, is following, well, the Sigma SDK implementation, right, of ErgoTree and ErgoScript, but well, this reference nature is not making anything official. I mean, I don't even understand such term here to start with. Or does it mean official? And who can give such status to some codes? Right, well, no any jurisdiction or whatever considered right. So it's misleading. It's confusing and does not make any sense.

[05:49] **qx()**: No, and it also doesn't lend a hand to resilience necessarily. If you have official things, official things can be taken down and pulled away, and that doesn't look good for a project necessarily. So if it's not representing an open source peer-to-peer project like Ergo properly, then there's no reason to have it there, especially because of that kind of exposure. So without those kind of self-proclaimed official entities, you have a bit more resilience to the protocol, I think.

[06:19] **kushti**: Yeah and so what's also discussed in Hong Kong and tell us about Hong Kong kushti tell us about Hong Kong yeah so we heard well like hundreds of conversations with different entities and people around. And, well, also talks with Sigmanauts. Well, what we have currently in the ecosystem, right, is, well, a variety of players or commercial players established such as Zengate right we had a lot of conversations with Sam Zengate still then yeah not legally established anywhere to the best of my knowledge but still doing some commercial activity such as Rosen for example right so.

[07:25] **kushti**: Then, yes, some non-profit organizations, community organizations, established nodes, such as Sigmanauts, Ergo Foundation, Ergo Devs DAO, and so on, right? So, well, it's now maybe... Well, the best representation of this core, right, could be some kind of informal alliance, right, and then there is actually some marketing group, well, existing, just to think, such as Sigmanauts, right, some private groups, but it actually has a lot of people from community, like 60 or 70.

[08:17] **kushti**: So then, yeah, well, the idea, which I still need to write down there, actually, because, well, spending a lot of times after the trip, well, finishing conversations, resolving different issues and so on. So, well, the idea is to get us in sync right there. And then, yeah, well, try to represent Ergo collectively, right? Well, there are different representations of protocols we have. Well, the core protocol, right? And then, yeah, well, some protocols on top of such as oracles and so on right and infrastructure and yeah that's totally perfect right to have different views but then yeah well the idea is to get in sync and represent Ergo well as somewhat well some common grounds which is shared, right, for different builders of peer-to-peer everything kind of future.

[09:49] **kushti**: And then, yeah, well, there are different users, right, for those entities. So for Zengate, it's, well, mostly about B2B, probably, right, relationships. For MewFinance, it's, yeah, very informal kind of relationship right and the same for Rosen and so on but to say that it is B2C even right if it's about again some protocol as in case of Rosen run by like hundreds of people right so then yeah it's it's kind of I don't know like mostly like digital corporation which is run by well broad base of shareholders something like that right.

[10:57] **qx()**: How did that work for Bitcoin back in the day, kushti, since you were around? How did some kind of... Yeah, I guess so.

[11:09] **kushti**: There were different efforts, right? So initially it was like Bitcoin talk, right? And well, I haven't been around back in 2010. But, yeah, from reading the forum after, it seems it was like, I don't know, just a bunch of enthusiasts trying to push Bitcoin as unstoppable money, well, launching different initiatives, initiatives such as, well, helping WikiLeaks, for example, right, when it was cut by established financial institutions. So, well, it was maybe the first, well, marketing campaign, big marketing campaign for Bitcoin back in 2010, right? And, well, there are opinions that, yes, Satoshi disappeared after, probably, because he thinks started to be quite serious, right? It was not just a small peer-to-peer effort, a peer-to-peer system from enthusiasts, right? Well, starting with Wikileaks campaign.

[12:37] **kushti**: But then, yeah, there was attempt to do a Bitcoin foundation, right well with basically the same mission I believe right as Ergo Foundation so yeah well I guess Ergo Foundation is kind of like third or fourth iteration of the Bitcoin foundation but then yeah well the foundation seems to exist and then well what we had after and what do we have now? Well, it was established especially clear during the block-sized civil war, right? So, well, there are some commercial organizations starting with Blockstream. So Blockstream was a commercial company established back in 2015 by like eight co-developers of Bitcoin with the idea to develop sidechains and then Lightning network as well. So it's still doing more or less the same, right? Not quite successful, but Blockstream got successful in mining at least.

[14:00] **kushti**: mining Bitcoin, right, so it's also quite a big miner. I don't know about these days, but it used to be quite big. A few years ago when I checked, it had like, I don't know, 16% of total mining hash rate. So yeah, Blockstream and then some other commercial companies which are, well, basically sponsoring co-development, right? There are some grants, some salaries for co-developers, but yeah, by commercial companies. Then there are miners for sure, big pools and hardware manufacturers right so they're just one company basically now but yeah back then back in 2010 so back in block size civil war times there were more right and so well yeah in regards with protocol they came into some agreements, right? Like Hong Kong agreements.

[15:26] **qx()**: Do you think they had not an easier time per se, you know, because they're forging the way with Bitcoin? Definitely a different time, right? Because at no point did people compare Bitcoin in the early days to other... There were no other market cap coins to compare it to and say, why isn't Bitcoin rising as much or why is Bitcoin falling more than this project over here? So I feel like while it was difficult for them to pave that initial way into cryptocurrency, they didn't have the same, you know, it's a totally different world now than it was back then with other VCs pumps to compare it to and those kind I mean the number one thing we see in chats when people try to FUD us is right. How come this isn't performing like this or how come this isn't performing like this? Meanwhile you look in Ergo's fairly well following Bitcoin or following, you know other chains as well, but Bitcoin didn't necessarily have that in the beginning. There wasn't that kind of FUD, I'd say, that most chains nowadays are exposed to.

[16:39] **kushti**: Well, there were no talks about pricing at all back in 2010, right? Because there were no exchanges. So, I mean, those talks, yeah, well, certainly did not take place at all about pricing. Yeah, about competition, I don't know. So, well, I think the biggest competition, the biggest fear was, you know, the fear of total crackdown and, well, the biggest fear was and still is fear to go to real world, right? So, and then, yeah, so Bitcoin find itself in a little bit gray areas, right, and still, well, the whole space is there, and then, yeah, there is competition, somewhat competition there, but, yeah, well, competition for liquidity, right, and going into this a little bit gray zones, but, well, it's still, I think, more or less the same challenges overall, right.

[17:58] **kushti**: I mean even, well, if you see like, I don't know, 1,000 different assets on some centralized exchanges, some centralized exchange, right, CoinMarketCap, whatever, the question is, well, what's the real world impact from like, well, any of them right beyond like a few like I don't know Monero Bitcoin so yeah I think the answer is zero real world impact to those projects. Yeah, so well, it's just about games in sandbox, but then I mean, it's quite strange. I mean, discourse, right? I mean, how successful Ergo is in, well, games in a sandbox. I think it's one of the things I see. It's strange optics, right?

[19:13] **qx()**: Yeah. But the global idea of cryptocurrencies and blockchains, I still see the narrative is still even from people like Michael Saylor, right? Who's a big Bitcoin proponent, right? All I see in the tidbits of him. I'm sure maybe deep down if I watch a video of him explaining things are going through it There might be more but the bottom line is the only tidbits I see from him on Twitter or the news sites or other big influences like that are that you know, specifically with Bitcoin, that Bitcoin is digital gold and Bitcoin is the investment. At no point do I hear the narrative ever shifted to, you know, this is a utility and here's how we can layer onto this and build more utility. And here's what we can potentially do in the future. So you have all these voices with pushing this big narrative of, here's this investment tool, here's this digital gold that's non-inflationary, that your dollar will be worth more if you invest in it. So that trickles down to everybody. And I'm sure that's what's contributing to the massive speculation on all these pump and dump and VC investments. I think it's going to be hard, but I think the narrative needs to change to not just here's some deflationary currency that you can use. It's internet magic money, but here's what we can do with it. And here's how it can help people in other countries. Here's where it can help local shop owners. Here's where it can help people sick of things like eBay or other things. Here's where we have a digital stable that you can put your money into and fight inflation there. So yeah, I think until the, the main narrative changes to utility, and what it can do, we're still going to see a massive, you know, thought process that cryptocurrencies for speculation and for, and for pumping and earning.

[21:06] **kushti**: Right. Well, actually, digital gold use case is not that bad, right? Because, well, it's, well, people need to store value, right? Especially during turbulent times. Fiat is totally unacceptable for that. Basically, there is no stable fiat currency. Yeah. So you can buy gold, right? But it's quite inconvenient, right? In many aspects then. Well, digital gold is better, right? In many aspects. You can send it.

[21:54] **qx()**: Easier accessible, easier to store.

[21:56] **kushti**: Outside, yeah, easily. You can accumulate it easily. There is no need to, I don't know, build storage, right? Some underground storage in your backyard, right? And then, I don't know, expand it when you have more gold and so on. So, yeah, well, it's more convenient, right? But then, yeah, so if we are talking about, well, not VCs, but even commercial companies and then central banks and so on, right? They have access to gold, right? Well, especially central banks. Well, in some, in actually many jurisdictions, they monopolized access to gold, even so, gold producers have to sell gold to central banks in the first place, right?

[22:57] **kushti**: But, well, if they have digital gold, then, yeah, I think it's quite natural, maybe for commercial companies, actually, in the first place, to build money on top of rights or to have trustless derivatives. And here Bitcoin is quite failing and Ergo could be superior, I believe because you can have trustless derivatives right you can combine collateral with trustless like ChainCash is doing right so you can have well many issues for real world needs on top of programmable digital gold which is quite a different story well especially considering that even if you have Bitcoin right but well, it's just an asset on your asset sheet, right? The question is how do you produce derivatives? Derivative instruments to be used in international trade, for example, right? Who will trust your asset sheet, right, in like thousands of kilometers away? in some remote country. So, and well, here is trustless derivative instruments, quite superior, right?

[24:37] **kushti**: So, yeah, well, had a lot of talks about that, and yeah, it seems that there is huge demand for that, right? So, and well, it's it's developing in different ways around the globe, right? So, well, in the US, for example, as far as I know, well, there is prohibition for CBDC now, right? But then there are commercial companies like Tether basically doing free banking, so issuing dollar, right? minting USD rights according to some corporate procedures basically. I don't know what kind of oversight they have now but initially I hate it was there was no oversight, right? Well, it's hard to say what's going on now, but yeah, probably with relocation to Salvador, right? There wouldn't be much oversight also, right? So this is basically about going to free banking, right? The system where, well, money created without oversight from central bank by private banks, right, so currently money created by private banks as well, but a tight oversight from central banks talking about reserve system assets control.

[26:33] **kushti**: Free banking, there is need for transparency, right? Especially talking about international trade, right? Global setting, like this operating case. Yeah, well, I think programmable gold, again, is a bit misjudged, right? It's not allowing for derivatives. Yeah, well, at the end of the day, there were a lot of Bitcoin events about Lightning network and so on. Well, it's still basically early stage and what's Lightning guys, TAPS companies are to do now is to get away the initial peer-to-peer, totally peer-to-peer Lightning design, right? So basically compromising the initial design in the name of convenience and so on and well the whole Bitcoin DeFi movement I believe is about getting trustless derivatives but it's going slowly there are certain issues on the way and so yeah.

[28:08] **qx()**: How do we wedge in there? How do we you know, it's got to be from what I my posture on Bitcoin users, maybe just an axis that I'm exposed to is that you know, if it's not Bitcoin, it's nothing right? So how do we that's that's a hard hard market to bust into and especially say look, you know your protocol is amazing. It's Bitcoin. It's digital gold It's been around forever, right? It's the first one Well, not first one, but you know first big one But here's a layer with Ergo that can turn your Bitcoin into you know lending platform peer-to-peer swaps all that kind of stuff. So how do we I mean, that's a market we have to break into, I think, right? So I think that should be a lot of our focus as well, is not only preaching that to those people, but showing by example, as well as marketing to them.

[29:05] **kushti**: Right, so then maybe it's better to start with, well, entities which do need for monetary expansion, right, so which are using Bitcoin for reserves, right, on other levels, so it could be some small community, right, or a big corporation. Because if there is some guy which just bought Bitcoin and then claiming superiority of Bitcoin, I mean, that's understandable story, but I mean, what can you do with that? It's just a guy who bought, I mean, like brick of digital gold. And that's it, right? So it's not about need for derivatives, right, or whatever. So then I think it's better to find some partners in the real world. And here we also had a lot of conversations and, well, it's too early to announce anything but yeah well actually Ergo is now well I think since second half of 2024 so well it's now under radar of many entities so from even Bitcoin OG whales I know about some to some big Middle East funds and so on. Now it's also known that it's under the radar of some Chinese funds and so on so yeah well I think I think well well, the recognition is coming, right? Because, well, it's kind of an interesting time, right?

[31:27] **kushti**: So, well, again, back to consensus Hong Kong. So, well, partly it was like meme coins funeral, right? So, it was quite clear to most people that after this scam space, well, this scam space is going to be, recognized, right? I mean, it was quite clear, since like early days.

[32:00] **qx()**: Are very clear than what it is. Yeah.

[32:01] **kushti**: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it was quite clear that it's about scams, but you know, I mean, when you have like billions at stake, so you have, you know, like, CEOs of centralized exchanges talking complete nonsense like meme coins will be the next cycle, which is completely insane. I mean, it's like, I don't know.

[32:30] **qx()**: But it's like, it's like, it's like burning. It's burning paper to keep warm instead of wood, you know, or coal.

[32:36] **kushti**: But when you have stake, when you have stake in it, then you can tell even such nonsensical things, right? Like scams will be the next big thing. Yeah, I mean, scams are always making crypto, unfortunately, right? But I mean, making a trend out of scams. So yeah, even biggest centralized exchanges, which tried to push such absurd nonsense back in 2024, now stepped down, you know, because, well, it's way too much, right? So retail cannot consume this anymore, right? Because, well, I don't know, it's too scammy to start with. I mean, it's a much bigger scam than all those previous scams, centralized exchanges supported.

[33:43] **qx()**: Yeah, I hear that. That's the noisiest part, right? I mean, those people as well, unfortunately, once those things dry up, they're looking for the next thing. And I think we just have to keep shouting utility and usefulness and that kind of stuff to perhaps be picked up in whatever cycle is coming next, but yeah, it's really tough to you know, go somewhere and talk about it and the number one thought on people's mind is a crypto scam. Isn't that the Trump coin isn't that the meme coin, you know kind of thing so it's a hard battle of fight against but I think Sigmanauts are positioned in a good way at least because we have the we have the beef right we have the stuff to back it up and say look, you know, whenever that happens and somebody says it's a scam I say hey look, here's what we have on Ergo. Here's what we're doing. You know, that's totally wind going by us that we don't technically listen to too often except when people come in and FUD so in those conversations I say we have this we have something like SigmaFi where if you want to buy a car and you have crypto that you don't want to cash out necessarily you can You know speculate a little bit and lend it, swap it for SigmaUSD, cash out and then pay yourself back slowly to repay the loan or DuckPools or those kinds of financial tools. So there's so much stuff on Ergo that I can point to to these people to make them think oh really? You know, that can be done. That's not just a magic money kind of thing. So I definitely think we're well positioned more than anybody else in that matter.

[35:21] **kushti**: Right. And yeah, also more interesting tooling is coming. So index funds, for example, right. Well, another iteration of ErgoRaffle, I think it would be much more useful for just ordinary folks, right, which are willing to collect ERGs for their project, for example, but USD, right, or maybe even gold-denominated assets such as Gluon or Dexy Gold. And, yeah, so for Dexy Gold, well, as UI, well, the second attempt to UI is quite near. Hopefully we can launch well in coming days, weeks. Let's see.

[36:24] **qx()**: You see the beautiful, yeah, you see the pictures from C8?

[36:28] **kushti**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So then, yeah, so well, the plan, you know, is to, well, resolve storage rent issue for SigmaUSD bank box and then yeah well I can issue take last look and generate with AI some more tests for Dexy Gold but yeah that's just I don't know like one day one and a half and then yeah we can go live. So, yeah, the Dexy Gluon, but then, yeah, index funds. Index funds, I see them as, well, brick also for building financial infrastructure. So, for example, for ChainCash, right, well, if you are willing to put, like, multiple assets in reserve, then you can do your index funds, right, put assets there and then use index funds tokens as a ChainCash reserve basically right and by that you may have like multi-asset reserve and so on and yeah well another thing which could be quite interesting and yeah I'm currently checking is to have collateralized off-chain cash right with well clearing off-chain clearing, and then redemption to layer 2, but then most of transactions in small communities, for example, would be cleared before redemption, so you can use it for charity, instead of providing loans, you can just who provides donations to some African village for example so you can put collateral and issue payment notes and then most of them would be cleared on the way so you have like 20x of economic activity versus your collateral which is much improvements right in comparison with donation.

[39:07] **qx()**: Is this like an offshoot of ChainCash, kushti, using kind of the same idea?

[39:13] **kushti**: It's just off-chain collateralized cash. But yeah, also you can go further, right? So for example, you can put your funds, not in like on-chain contracts, bound collateral, but to DAO treasury, right? For example. And then, yeah, these DAO may vote which are not created within community to redeem, right, which are not. So when there is need to go outside, for example, for some community, right, they can vote on redemption, right, but otherwise you can have money circulation within community just like an LETS system, right? So without any collateral, without anything, just IOU community notes, right? And then in case of international, well, inter-community trading, so you can go to treasury. Actually, that's quite used in some parts of Mexico, even. There are some communities in Chiapas, for example, which are quite autonomous, but they need some money sometimes, and to make this money they are selling coffee some premium coffee actually, but they're selling just a little bit to cover expenses needed when they're interacting with outer world and so on.

[41:07] **kushti**: Yeah, so, well, it's just like tools, right, what we do have in DeFi, I believe. And, well, it's now time, as there are enough tools, to go outside and, well, to become a reserve asset for different calibers from small communities to, well, as it's permissionless, right, and then you can expect big players, well, even maybe state level actors at some point like happened with Bitcoin right no nobody predicted that by the way back in 2010 it wasn't it was it was quite anti-state right back in 2010 but yeah it's happening so and well you cannot prevent right this and permissionless system but what's what should be in focus for builders, I believe, is how to serve, well, real needs, right? And, well, communities people in need. And then, I don't know, big players will come, I think, because, well, everyone will realize what's real, what's not here after all.

[42:35] **qx()**: I mean, that's a hope, right? Yeah. Let me just give two quick updates before we jump into questions. Maybe one, we've got to vote up on Sigmanauts at least from the Sigmanauts side. We've got to vote up on Sigmanauts to send neuro yogi Mark the Shark to Disrupt, which is a big mining conference in Miami. So I think it's very important that we Ergo as a proof of work chain, even though you know, it's, there's a lot of ASICs and those kinds of things at this conference. That's the center of it that we send somebody down there to mill around say the word Ergo get people out there and let them know that GPU mining is there and benefits of it and the peer-to-peer kind of resilience of it. So that vote is a couple days in a couple days more left. Hopefully it's looking positive and we'll be able to fund them to get out there. We'll make them a bunch of business cards big ones with like a wallet on the front and in the back things like the Sigmanauts mining DAO or Rosen Bridge or those kind of things where yeah you know if you're mining Bitcoin over there with your ASIC and you have a large store of them why not put them to use why not bring them over to Ergo and use our learning systems, use our DAOs to help run those things. So that's a message there that we're hoping to do. And I think Mark will be very successful at it.

[44:01] **qx()**: We also have a vote up. We've revamped our SigShop. So you might see some new postings on MewFinance. HQx is going to handle all that front end stuff. And then we've got myself to ship them out to you once they come in. So we've kind of divided up the work as opposed to all being on one person. So those are up. We've got all the inventory matched with his site. So please order away, order your stuff. We've got hats, sweatshirts, and t-shirts. Once those run out, we'll talk about doing different stuff and maybe take votes on what you want to see next for swag. So those are the two things out of the Sigmanauts. Anything out of the developers DAO question specifically before we go to questions?

[44:45] **kushti**: Yeah, so we're also having first voting. So yeah, the key is distributed. And yeah, well, I'm having some issues with my voting to try to understand. But yeah, it's quite exciting to see it's in action in the form of DAO. So yeah, well, and well, it's also good to see more contributors. So well, we have some guys back now, like Corbey Chalador, and some new guys. So there was quite intense developers chat yesterday. And yeah, that's just the beginning, I believe.

[45:36] **qx()**: Nice, yeah, I'm looking at Paideia now. You guys have your first vote up that's active. 100% yes, it looks like it's going to pass.

[45:43] **kushti**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we'll do more. And yeah, so there is also a fundraising I'm doing for DevsDAO basically. So for security audit of 6.0 to be made by Dusek. Actually, he already found quite a lot of issues, right? Especially around versioning. It would be good to do more audit. We continue to check all the things. But yeah, well, he found even some non-trivial DOS possibilities. So yeah, that's quite amazing. I think should be rewarded. So please check raffles on ergoraffle.com.

[46:41] **qx()**: All right, very cool. All right, let's dive in. We've got... Let's see. I had to mute the Big 3D. He was being a little special there, but let's see if he has any good questions in the beginning. Well we'll take this from him. It won't let me show it actually. Let me see. All right. All right. Let me show it. It won't let me show this question, but I'll read it. He says, the Big 3D says what's happening with Kraken is Ergo. Will it be listed in the future? So you don't know there was a there was a comment by Dave I believe it said his name Peter maybe I can't keep track of the Dave and Peters on the on there, let me look it up. It is Peter that said that you know, it were there was some misunderstandings in his his response there but we as Sigmanauts are thrifty, right and useful of our resources, so we are currently trying to go through another method to get our voices heard behind the Kraken lines. So keep you updated as it can go, but we'll see what happens, right? And furthermore, we always have Rosen-ERG to back up on. That application is in. Peter's aware of it. You know, we got the classic DM response of, you know, we have a lot of things in our backlog, but we're hoping our new countermeasure to penetrate their defenses will go off smoothly. So we'll see how that goes.

[48:21] **kushti**: All right, all right. But yeah, well, as I have some experience of talking with centralized exchanges. Talks with MEXC started, for example, back in 2019. I had some calls and a lot of talks with one of the top managers, actually. I don't know, maybe because it was a small exchange maybe back then. Quite small.

[48:56] **qx()**: Well, a lot of these things happen, kushti, with personal relationships, right? So, I mean, that's technically the avenue we're attempting here. So, yeah.

[49:03] **kushti**: Right. So, yeah. Well, relationships and also a lot of, but again, always happening, right? With MEXC, it started with like 5 Bitcoin, right? But finally, well, it was community fundraiser. For how much in total, like 60k? I don't know, for 40k, 60k, something like that. Yeah, and well, yeah, and it was much better than five Bitcoin, right? And well, it was also about much bigger exchange in 2024 than back in 2019. Right, so, well, you know, if you are not listed, then you can always be in talks, right, so they are not finishing, so, well, there is no point here, right, so, period, I mean, here, well, until it's listed. Right. So well, we have another rounds and, let's see, well, whether, we will be successful in these rounds or another one.

[50:25] **kushti**: Yeah. But yeah, I mean, that's just game rights. Quite strange, but, well, yeah, I think actually, well, it should be in focus maybe at this point. Well, there is need for some U.S. exchange, right, for sure. Critical needs maybe depending on community feedback but other than that so it's always better to spread vision right and well to take care about recognition and getting more Sigmanauts on board and we'll get more builders, right? And yeah, well, to build liquidity around and so on. And then yes, centralized exchanges will come, right? Naturally. But yeah, well, at the same time, it's good to continue to talk, at least to get temperature right in the room.

[51:42] **qx()**: No, right. Yeah. I mean, brigading, too, is also fun online, right? I love seeing the Sigmanauts bomb, Twitter bomb Kraken, and Dave and Peter. It's always fun to see. That's, I think, that's a good indicator of a live community, and that shouldn't be stopped. That's great.

[52:04] **qx()**: We have a comment for the website. I think you need to update their website team Some links are broken some CEXes that listed Ergo, but not linked on Ergo website. That's I believe you can suggest changes to that or maybe that's dev docs on the Ergo website, but that's Glasgow, ping Glasgow. That man's happy to fix everything and he will be surprised if there are things like that so please ping Glasgow directly to make him aware of that kind of stuff for the website.

[52:32] **qx()**: Let's see. Here's a question from Bobcat. He's wondering, are there any plans to do joint eUTXO hackathons with either Cardano or Bitcoin ecosystems to increase visibility?

[52:46] **qx()**: Yeah that'd be nice with Rosen right with Rosen it's interoperable right you can have a joint hackathon and have a common token between them so yeah it's possible but the question is would would others be willing to do that right we're part of somewhat part of the UTXO alliance so I guess we could start it there yeah there but you know actually it's interesting idea so well I can I can bring awareness to UTXO alliance calls and maybe it's what to discuss with Cardano peers as well.

[53:26] **qx()**: So in the last week we spoke about, we spoke about a mini hackathon for, sponsored by the Sigmanauts and it jumps off of Mark's idea to specifically train an AI model to not only write ErgoScript and smart contracts, but to check it too. So you have one that does both, or you have a specially trained model to write it in a special chain model to check it. So those kinds of things could also be, you know, that could be across many chain collaboration with Cardano to get it to write smart contracts and Cardano as well as Ergo. So maybe we can see if Mark knows anybody over in Cardano land or any Sigmanauts do to see if anybody's interested that that may be something coming down the pipe.

[54:10] **kushti**: No, let's see. Well, it would be funny even to have maybe Bitcoin and ErgoHackathon. But we need to do some counterpart. Because we can do stuff like DLC contracts and the different atomic swaps and so on. So, well, things which are quite quite common for both blockchains, right? So I don't know. Let's see. Let me also answer from FC Alex thoughts. So if any on recent discussions, that's Jack Dorsey, Satoshi, no comment. Yeah. So, you know, Satoshi is not some I don't know, philosopher, like writer, or the internet, right, like fiction writer. But yeah, so he is a developer, C++ developer, and he is using, he used I mean, quite unique style of coding, right? So then she show me Jack Dorsey C++ code and I can tell her. But yeah, I'm pretty sure he's not because I'm not quite sure, Jack Dorsey used C++ ever in his life. And you know, Satoshi's C++, I mean, it's quite unique, as I said, so it's not like professional corporate developers C++, more like hacker or InfoSec, maybe developer C++. Right, so well, it's quite unique and it's a thing which you cannot really fake, I believe, especially back then, right, without AI and whatever. Because, yeah, well, there are some things like how you work with stack and so on, which are showing what you are usually doing. And so, yeah, well, based on that, Satoshi was quite like a hacker, an InfoSec developer, maybe. Not a professor in cryptography, for example, definitely not a corporate developer. not Jack Dorsey, not Nick Szabo and so on, right? Well, in regards with other candidates, the first question is, show me the code, right? Well, especially around that time. So, for example, I found some Adam Back's code from 2007 on the Internet, and yeah, I can say that Adam Back is not Satoshi as well right because well it's it's quite different so and you cannot really change style in like months you know right okay let's see we've yeah sorry gone we've got let's answer this really quickly for people wondering.

[57:46] **qx()**: Why did Joe leave the foundation? I think from my understanding Joe leaving the foundation gave him more flexibility to run his own projects, right? So now he could focus more on Rosen Bridge which needs a ton of focus, right? They're not only dealing with you know, it's not like they're dealing with one chain here They're dealing with Cardano Bitcoin Ethereum Binance and he's got a fairly large team to run as well. So so all that kind of stuff, as well as all of Joe's musings, I believe led Joe to want more flexibility in that kind of project running. So that's why he took the leap there. That's my understanding.

[58:25] **kushti**: Yeah. And Joe's around. Yeah. Well, we have talks like daily, maybe. Well, almost. And yeah. So, he's also publishing quite nice articles, these days. Right. He's got like four or five that he sent me.

[58:41] **qx()**: Yeah. Very nice. Yeah. What's, what are they? The, the internet?

[58:47] **kushti**: Yeah. Yeah, but also a new proof-of-work scheme, tailored for high-performance AI-oriented GPUs like H100. Yeah, that's quite interesting.

[59:13] **qx()**: Those 85 gig memory GPUs, what to do with them after they get dueled for AI. He's got a nice write-up on that. Pretty cool. Yeah.

[59:23] **kushti**: Yeah. Well, and also some modification to the Bitcoin runes protocol to have metadata which can be used then maybe for Ergo applications.

[59:40] **qx()**: All right. Let's see here. We have Bobcat wants to know if there's any follow-up to Navjit the CEO at Iagon Yeah, Bobcat. That's we spoken with him that's part of the path that we're looking forward to build a real relationship with somebody behind the lines of Kraken so thankfully Navjit has some connections and we're moving forward with that the best we can so very grateful for Navjit to reach out to us on Twitter very thankful let's see we've got you want to talk about.

[60:21] **qx()**: All right. Let's see. Misfit toy has two questions. They're centered around sub-blocks, but he's saying, Mr. McCracken from ADA, from Cardano says the biggest hurdle for Ergo getting adopted more and it's the slowness. Do you agree? Then the follow up question is how fast will sub-blocks make Ergo fast in Solana? He says it'll be one of the fastest period to peak, but not AWS. What's the difference kind of thing. So I guess a general question about, in summary, kushti, are two-minute block times causing a slowness and adoption of Ergo and will sub-blocks appease those people who want fast confirmation times?

[61:04] **kushti**: Yeah, I don't know. So, well, I never heard, for example, that's, you know, like 10 minutes blocks. Well, it's a problem for Bitcoin adoption.

[61:19] **qx()**: Right. What is it? 10 minute blocks on Bitcoin? Bitcoin is 10. I can't remember.

[61:25] **kushti**: So it's 10 on average, but yeah, there was the case once when, you know, like many years ago, I met one guy to cash out. And yeah, we did wait for block, well, some space for like, one hour and a half. Yes. So sometimes you can wait like two hours for Bitcoin block. And, yeah, well, I, I never heard that this is a problem for adoption. I mean, it, it depends on what, what, what, what adoption looks like. Right. So, well, it's, if adoption is about, well, games and sandbox again, like, well uh having a meme coin casino right like pump.fun then yeah maybe yeah i mean it's but i mean it's not some some kind of adoption which is expected, right? And Ergo protocol could not be good here. Well, not because of block time, but because of peer-to-peer nature, right? So when you have like hundreds of laptops, ordinary laptops, like you're using some laptop, right? qx(). for running an Ergo node and so probably you wouldn't be happy to see it's been overloaded because of some casino, right?

[63:14] **kushti**: Yeah, so then there are some specialized networks which are not peer-to-peer actually like Solana and so on and so on, right, which are well suited for meme casinos or tap games or all that stuff. So, well, it's quite pointless to talk about competition with them, because it's different classes, right? I mean, you cannot compare peer-to-peer network with data center-based BFT, somewhat. But block time, it's the same. I mean, if it's peer-to-peer, it's it would be like Ergo in a way right and then yeah if it's data center based and yeah you can have a meme coin casino right talking about adoption right no not not just confirmation time so that the question is what adoption is right and so if we are talking about things like, I don't know, programmable, digital, gold-like assets for a resource of any caliber, right? Then, yeah, well, it's two minutes block is okay. And there is no issue here.

[64:45] **qx()**: Yeah, that's something that's

[64:48] **kushti**: Yeah, then if we are talking about payments, right, like the very natural thing you can do with money, then yeah, I mean, it's then sub-blocks would make a difference. But yeah, I believe after all, with adoption, so most of transactions even in regards with payments would be off-chain, right? Because well, it's whether you have sub-blocks or whatever the question is. Can your laptop do that, right? Also being connected with hundreds, thousands of laptops around the globe. And if it's about some crazy meme coins casino, then yeah, there is no technology, right, which can do magic here, right? I mean, there is no magic. We have just a data center based systems which are doing great finance like meme coins casino but then it's I mean it's simply dangerous for the founders maybe even right to some point because it's it's pretty much like having PayPal right but also without any licenses and yeah, also with a crazy casino on top of with a lot of crazy events happening like daily from presidential rugpulls to now also suicides, right, and live streams.

[66:28] **qx()**: Absolutely insane, yeah.

[66:30] **kushti**: And so, yeah, and if it's run on top of centralized system like Solana, right, and so on, then at some point there would be question of responsibility, right, of organizers of all such systems.

[66:46] **qx()**: Yeah, I think I think that'll come with education custody I think I think you know people just touching systems based on meme tokens. That's all they see right They see why isn't Ergo able to support this or why aren't people flocking to Ergo for this kind of craze and I think it's a matter of time in the ecosystem and a realization of what blockchain the sustainability of blockchains actually is in the future and that's what Ergo is, in my opinion, peer-to-peer networks, finance, tooling, that kind of thing.

[67:15] **kushti**: So it's just an education thing, I think, when people make that distinction of... Yeah, going back to Satoshi, so he also stated pretty clear why peer-to-peer structure of network was chosen, right, and why Bitcoin is following certain paradigms and Bitcoin not appeared out of something, right. So there were more centralized payment systems which were shut down before, right? And so Bitcoin was actually quite a counter reaction to those shutdowns, right? So yeah, I mean, and well, it seems it's all it's all silenced these days right so well for some reason we need to to have something with totally idiotic discourse rights, which is completely ignoring the history of cryptocurrencies, of Bitcoin, of payment systems, after all, pre-Bitcoin payment systems. Then the next question, how fast will sub-blocks make Ergo faster than Solana? Yeah, so it could be maybe faster for some notion of confirmation, right? But yeah, still still, it, it, it wouldn't be about, you know, like, bringing, I don't know, millions of transactions, to, to, to hopefully laptops.

[69:20] **qx()**: Hopefully we can program in some failed transactions to them, given that same experience.

[69:26] **kushti**: Sorry.

[69:27] **qx()**: Hopefully we can program in some failed transactions just to give them the same experience.

[69:34] **kushti**: A lot of system messages to be counted as transactions and so on. Yeah. So actually a performance wise proof of work protocols like Ergo are the best, but then yeah, you need to consider that there is peer to peer network after all. Right. And there is commodity here. Well, because there is need to have secure network, not data center-based network with not so efficient even BFT protocol, consensus protocol, but also with very centralized approach to everything.

[70:13] **qx()**: We've got a good question from CLS90ZZZ on Rosen. What happens if Rosen guards do a mistake like Bybit multi-sign instead once the Rosen-ERG price crash versus ERG on Bybit? If you've got your funds out, you're fine. But with Rosen, you look exposed forever. So I can give a stab at that question. You can correct me. If I'm if I'm wrong. So Rosen has right so in order to fake out Rosen you need to socially attack the watchers and I guess hack the guards, right? So you have to socially engineer the guards or else find out their locations and their IPs and what machines are running them on and try to hack that so remember, the Bybit Multi-Sig error was going from a cold wallet to another wallet, redoing the contract for that. So if you're talking about watchers and guards, first of all, you'd have to get a majority of the watchers fake an actual transaction right and then the guards would find that transaction and most likely they'd catch it and see that it was a fake transaction right somehow so you have that double layer there let's say you compromise the guards on top of that right the guards would have the guards still need to look on the chain so you'd have to essentially compromise both the watcher system and the guard systems to get a fake transaction through that way right so let's go to the cold wallet side.

[71:33] **qx()**: The way that we work from cold wallet on the guards is we literally have cold devices that we initiate transactions on. So in order to fake us out there, you would then have to compromise one of the guards and initiate a cold signing transaction that we see that. It's not broadcast anywhere. We do it with our local communications group. So in the beauty about Ergo, the beauty about pulling things from cold storage, even in Cardano, is that we can see exactly what address it's going to, right? There's no complexity as there would be in something like the Bybit attack where they can change the multi-sig contract without you even really knowing, right? They can mask it. So on Ergo, everything's perfectly viewable before we sign cold transactions to get them into the hot wallet. We can say, okay, here's the originating wallet. Yep, here are the boxes in the originating wallet. Here are the funds that are transferring, and here's the wallet it's going to, and it's visible every step of the way. So that kind of Bybit attack would be extremely hard or near impossible on Rosen Bridge or Ergo. kushti, you want to correct or fix?

[72:42] **qx()**: kushti, you want to correct or fix?

[72:44] **kushti**: I can add that Multisig is also done very differently from Ethereum and Solana, right? Well, in Ethereum and Solana, for example, it's about some predefined contracts SDK contracts and well there was issue with re-entrancy for example there which resulted into wormhole hack of 120 million USD so in Ethereum that's about well again some contracts not even standard to the best of my knowledge then yeah there were different contracts so for example parity which also lost like hundreds of millions back then probably in current prices much more like I don't know billions maybe because of yeah well contracts had possibility for everyone to nuke it and then yeah some schoolboy nuked it and then, yeah, so he wrote on Reddit or some forum, I've forgotten, like, oh, yeah, yeah, your contract is allowing for call suicide. And yeah, I just made suicide call and it seems instead. So, you know, for a lot of funds, so Parity funds got from Polkadot ICO and also funds of users of that library, multi-sig library, but Parity were lost. Other contracts also not immutable. I still need to check details, but it seems it was the case. Not an immutable multi-sig. So in case of Ergo, Multisig is immutable, right? So it's natively supported. There are no re-entrancy calls and so on because, well, no re-entrancy here. And yeah, well, it's also truly ZK, right? So from, if ZK is used, ZK signature is used by guards. But probably it's right, because it's about some custom software, so then it's possible. So then, yeah, well, it's very different, actually, implementation of Multisig. Well, on Ergo, blockchain versus Ethereum and so on. Well, it's much simpler and immutable, so safer in general for users, I believe.

[75:56] **qx()**: Yeah. Yeah. They'd have to literally change sources from that. So we'd see that in the transaction, that it was actually going to another wallet. So that would be very hard to pull the wool over the eyes of the guards in that matter. So yeah. All right. Let's see. We've got, let's see, one more question. I think this is a good question. We have many whales in Ergo. What advice would you give to them to utilize a margin investment to maybe get some type of return? or to help with adoption with a large investment. kushti, the amount of times I see arbitrage opportunities on the chains that Ergo is linking to, whether it was Rosen Bridge, there's many arbitrage opportunities for whales to utilize that. There's lending on DuckPools, there's lending on SigmaFi, they're supporting projects as well that come up as well support early and and work with them for your investment there, too so that would be my spit out of what whales can do to help bolster the ecosystem as well as their own their own bags to help them work for them. We do have we do currently have whales doing some arbitrage across but not as much as could be done. That's for sure We had a whale try to tank DuckPools the other day, right they they changed the, what's it called? They tried to lower the price, with lowering the price of ERG and the demand on the SigmaUSD pool, it liquidated a lot of users. So that's a not very good way to make use your bags. So that's for sure. I'm kind of dishonest, but it's financial, you know, it's permissionless. That's financial linked to tooling. So, I mean, you got to watch out for that stuff. But yeah, in the short arbitrage, SigmaFi DuckPools, supporting projects are great ways to make use your bags work for you.

[77:51] **kushti**: Yeah well and getting providing more liquidity right so getting better liquidity everywhere so it's quite profitable for whales so well Cardano whales it seems I know most of folks provided liquidity on Cardano DEXes and yeah it seems they're quite happy about, well, APY, all that stuff, you know, and, well, it's, it seems so liquidity provision is also good for a price, right? Because, well, people need to buy ERG then there is need for liquidity, right? And...

[78:46] **qx()**: Not just ERG, right? Not just ERG, there are many opportunities on Spectrum, on Ergo DEXes, as well where you can create yield farms, right? Yeah, so if you want to invest your Rosen-ERG bag, your ERG bag into projects, and then provide liquidity for those projects on DEXes, you could also yield farm. So you'll be getting extra token bonuses from those yield farms too. So keep an eye out for those kinds of things too, and snap those up when you can.

[79:15] **kushti**: Right, but then, yeah, so Spectrum, Uniswap, PancakeSwap, then there is Spectrum DEX, right, and here is also... MewDex, MewDex, kushti.

[79:27] **kushti**: MewDex, yeah, so there is also, well, need for liquidity, so... there are many pairs which can be created in order to get from arbitrage just for example Gluon Gold to SigmaUSD right pool it's probably not there right but then you can naturally earn through arbitrage with ERG pool and the same for many assets actually so I haven't seen even ADA to ERG and then again, you can earn from arbitrage. So bots will do arbitrage automatically.

[80:15] **qx()**: If you guys watch the Rosen Bridge website, you'll see 40,000 ERGs going back and forth, 50,000 ERGs going back and forth, hitting these arbitrage opportunities. So it's being done, but it needs some more competition, I think.

[80:32] **kushti**: Yeah, but then there is need for more thick Bitcoin liquidity, Bitcoin, and so on, right? So, well, I think whales have not just ERGs, probably also Bitcoin, USDT, and so on, right? So then, yeah, a lot of liquidity provision which would be good for Ergo, right? After all, because well, the deeper liquidity is yeah, about more possibilities everywhere. All right, so yeah, it seems, yeah, it's time to end the AMA, right?

[81:19] **qx()**: We've gone, I've got to get back to real work, kushti. All right, everybody, thanks so much for joining. It's been a pleasure. Thanks for all the questions. That was great.

[81:27] **kushti**: Alright, alright. Yeah, thank you everyone. Thank you, bye.
