      "answer": "We're going to see a split in the crypto space. Institutional adoption with stablecoins and regulatory frameworks will create public-private partnership digital money with surveillance capabilities. However, this increased surveillance will create the best narrative privacy projects and resilient neutral money has ever seen, as there's always an equal opposite polarity.",

Many Ergo developers work unpaid because they believe in the cause - they add value to enhance the system's value.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "It's better to build around Rosen Bridge rather than into it. Building swaps internally would create a messier situation for auditing that there's no rehypothecation, since the system holds collateral one-to-one. Cross-chain swaps are doable but shouldn't change the bridge protocol itself.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "You could create a premium fee system where users pay extra for speed. Liquidity providers would front funds with weaker assumptions and release them quickly, then get paid as the original transaction goes through the bridge protocol in the background. It's similar to how the banking system works for faster transfers.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "No, you need completely separate collateral for each chain - you can't use the same 30,000 RSN and 800 ERG for both Cardano and Ergo watchers. This forces distributed decentralization even among individuals running multiple watchers, as they'll likely run them on different machines and networks for reliability.",

      "answer": "Sub-blocks won't change finality requirements for dApps or exchanges - they'll still want 10+ main blocks for large transactions. But sub-blocks will be excellent for peer-to-peer transactions, allowing transfers between individuals within seconds with soft finality, similar to competing with apps like Zelle.",

This is different from just minting tokens - these are actual notes backed by reserves that people can use as payment. It essentially gives entities the power to create their own currency, which feels like taking power away from traditional government-controlled money systems.",

You can join a decentralized mining pool where you as the miner build blocks and still get shares, but how that's calculated isn't secret like traditional pools. It's designed to be modular and work across Bitcoin and other proof-of-work chains.",
