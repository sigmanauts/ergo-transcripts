[00:10] **tmr.erg**: All right, here we go, fellas.
[00:13] **tmr.erg**: Welcome.
[00:14] **tmr.erg**: Mark, good to see you.
[00:15] **tmr.erg**: Wade, thanks for coming on, man.

[00:18] **Wade**: Thanks, guys. Yeah, good to talk to you.

[00:21] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, for sure. So I'm just now meeting you, Wade. My name's Tim. People in Ergo know me as tmr.erg. And I've been here for like maybe three years now. I'm kind of following along. I am relatively new to crypto. I don't really have a background in it. My background is in education. I grew up in a rural place, so I didn't have exposure to a lot of tech. But I was generally good at math and stuff. And so as I got older, I'm fine. I can manage. But I'm not an expert, not a coder, nothing like that. But yeah, I stumbled into this community and just thought it really lined up with my values and then met Mark and me and Mark get along. So we started doing this, I guess, several months ago now. So I'm curious, what is your background and your relation to technology and finance? How'd you end up talking to us?

[01:29] **Wade**: Yeah, so I've had actually a pretty early exposure to crypto. Hold on one second, I'll close the door and we can start that over.

[01:50] **Wade**: So my background actually comes from I went to a magnet program with technical aspects to it. I can definitely talk about that at some point too in the future on this, but the program I went to was the Center for Advanced Technology. You can look that up and you can find out where that is, and I still live down the street from them.

[03:58] **Wade**: All right, here we go, guys. Deep breath. All right, so I went to a pretty technical high school called the Center for Advanced Technology where we were learning computer programming, a lot of math and science classes at that point in time too. And that was actually my first exposure to cryptocurrency. And I heard about Bitcoin in the early 2010s. Oh, wow. Because I have programming friends and programming classes that they were all a bunch of nerds on the edge of tech in a lot of ways. We were pirating sites with music and things like that were very prevalent in that period of time. File sharing, the whole school had networks with computers in the classroom. I think before that was a lot more prevalent in schools nowadays with individual logins connected to LAN. And so I was exposed to that type of stuff from an early age, and I've always really been fascinated by computers and technologies, to be honest, and I've built a couple computers over my life since then.

I think from that experience on, though, it was something I kind of put in the back of my head as something that still seemed pretty niche to me, or at least didn't click along with the people that I was hanging out with, the things that I was involved with, like sports. So I almost dismissed it for probably a very long time. Since that point, going through college and focusing on more production related sides of technology and media. And I've continued that through my career right now with my business. And I've always talked about with friends different types of cryptocurrencies and I've probably traded a little bit on Robinhood just for fun, never holding anything seriously. But again, I've been more interested in, through college I got a business degree, so definitely interested in finance and the workings of a business and all those types of things that go along with that.

So I've had a lot of traditional investments through that period of time, individual stocks, IRA plans, things like that. And I've just been pretty conservative focusing on those aspects, but still always interested in the technology of crypto and maybe some of the future use cases of it, but still kind of discovering more for my personal risk tolerance. And besides that, the true utility of it in a lot of ways.

[06:26] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, I think that's important whenever you think about crypto as an investment. It's like if you're already set and you're already going to retire and you have a plan, like it's fine to be conservative. Like you don't have to just roll all your money into Bitcoin. Like that's not responsible. And I mean, I'm the same way, it's like I evaluated my own risk tolerance and allocated accordingly and just like I'm not going to over invest in something that I don't control. So totally get it. And that's something I tell people. It's like, yeah, okay, if you're already retired, like you don't need to invest in Bitcoin. But if you don't want to, it's fine.

[07:06] **Wade**: Yeah, absolutely. But even now, so in current times, Bitcoin seems like still the most flourishing, most popular, most gains to be had in crypto in this way too. So I know there's a lot of subsets that you guys know better about than I do in the world, but I think my knowledge kind of stops at like the first couple highest market caps in crypto. And then besides that, I think my knowledge drops off pretty fast of what's available out there and the differences between each of those blockchains and coins and stuff.

[07:42] **tmr.erg**: Yeah. So Mark, what about you, dude? When's the first time you heard of crypto or blockchain or Bitcoin?

[07:49] **Marc the Shark**: I would say probably around like 2018. That's when I first bought Bitcoin. I was actually just looking the other day. I'm like, how much Bitcoin in my lifetime have I ever bought? Just to have that sort of FOMO, right? And it was nothing crazy. But yeah, I would say actually, though, thinking about it 2016, maybe 15, someone was mentioning how they're mining Ethereum. I'm like, what? This is weird. Like, you got a GPU. And at that point, I was just so focused just in my life and all that sort of stuff didn't really give it any sort of glimpse or look.

But I have a background in, I guess, mechanical engineering and then software engineering. And so kind of going through life, one thing led to another in terms of entrepreneurial type of ideas, built my own computer similar to Wade, and then all of a sudden I could find out, hey, I can use my GPUs to mine. From an investment perspective, my parents come from real estate. And so my dad was always kind of instilling that idea of just like, you need to buy assets instead of leaving it in the dollar. And so but on that same token, I don't really like the idea of working with tenants and things like that. And so that's where crypto and even stocks where I kind of come to play in my mindset, or even mining. And so instead of buying a stock or crypto, I can buy the asset that is the GPU miner. And then from there, I can continually rely on it on a reward more indefinitely for the most part. So that's kind of, I guess, my story there.

[09:32] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, that's cool, man. I, I guess, for me, probably like 2012, I heard about Bitcoin. And I remember like a really specific conversation with my mom. Like I came home from college, just visiting and like, hey, I heard about this thing. I didn't understand it. I was like, it's like money for your computer and you like use energy to get it. And I didn't like, didn't click, didn't understand. And then I just like blanked it out for a huge portion for like the next nine years or something. Didn't understand at all. And then I recently told the story to Mark about my mom asked me to explain Bitcoin to her and I couldn't so then I like did a deep dive and I was like, oh, this actually makes a lot of sense now that I'm like, I don't know what made it click this time that didn't happen before but I think maybe I just had a better understanding of finance and like the world economy and I could kind of see a place for it. So yeah, that's my story.

So next, I was gonna ask Wade, where are you in your understanding of Bitcoin and crypto? How would you describe Bitcoin? What would you say if I asked you to explain it in one minute?

[10:56] **Wade**: I'll do my best guys. Anyone else out there listening, go easy on me. It's written on a program that creates a blockchain, which creates a ledger, which is mined at certain intervals based on the difficulty of the state of the program, it rewards bitcoins after certain amounts of programming input to a processing power from GPUs. And then it's something that was created with a finite resource and it was meant to be mined over a certain period of time and just slowly being chipped away by all the GPUs out there.

I understand the idea of the blockchain with it can be traced back through the program through that and for what I understand also is made by a fairly anonymous source that's kind of like up for debate who it was, a few people trying to claim who it was at the same time so. It's decentralized, it's not controlled by a federal government or anything like that and it's stored in digital wallets on computers that keeps track of the certain keys of what's what, how many coins you have, or you can protect it with the encrypted with the password and exchange that between users for a certain fees on the chain as well. And basically send that all over the world then that way. And yeah, it's a digital currency.

[12:26] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, absolutely. That's pretty good. I would say you're like already in the 99th percentile.

[12:35] **Wade**: All right, so I would. Okay, understanding of programming. When I learned it, to begin with, I learned C-sharp, C++, HTML. I've done some small programs before. Mark and I have even sat down and we've messed with some of the data that I have from the drones that I use and gone over some programs. He's way more adept at it than I am, but I at least through my school understand the language of computers in that way. I don't think it's something that I could sit down and just come up off from the top of my head right now today, but I understand the ones and the zeros as in the if then, the input and output of a program like that. So I could at least have some sort of foundation to to build off of at least for comprehension and understanding.

[13:23] **tmr.erg**: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think you showed a pretty good understanding right there. I guess if I were to like critique anything, it would just be like little tiny bits like some of them use GPUs. Others use application specific circuits and CPU also or just GPU. I'm sure be way less efficient with the CPU. Different cryptos use different things. And I think I want to say Bitcoin started with the CPU. Is that right, Mark?

[13:58] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, totally. So that was like the initial but as the difficulty increased, then smaller and smaller likelihood of finding a block on CPUs and then people quickly moved over to GPUs. And then finally, like you're saying, Tim, the ASICs.

[14:12] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, when I talk to new people, like zero or very little understanding, I just try to get out that it's a distributed ledger that you have to use energy to change. And so all these people are competing with their energy use to make changes to the ledger. And then the other part that is point where people maybe make an assumption is like the coins are in your wallet like it's really just the blockchain and the blockchain associates coins with your wallet like that's not quite it's not quite accurate.

[14:56] **Wade**: The wallet stores the keys to that part of the chain. Yeah, the addresses to the chain where it's where you got the box.

[15:05] **Marc the Shark**: So the wallet, I think, has the private key to which gives you the ability to spend a given box and within that box is your specific asset. So your wallets that are tied to your private keys can be you could have a bunch of different boxes, but consolidated, they could have whatever summation amount of crypto is in that box. And then in order to spend that box to create a new box, with UTXO so unspent transaction output. So if I wanted to send you say 10 ERGs or like however much Bitcoin I have to burn the boxes that are in my that are signed by my private key and only by my private key and then send them to you and then that's the only way you can send it and so like what Tim was saying it's the wallet is sort of a view within the blockchain, then the subset of these blocks are only spendable by you with this specific protocol.

[16:02] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, that's a really good point to bring up too is like the public private keys. So one of the concepts in cryptography is like a puzzle that is hard to solve, but easy to prove, right? So I have a private key that only I know. And it's like cryptographically matches my public key, but you can't go from the public to the private. I can go from private to public and that allows me to send keys or send coins rather, but people can only kind of see where it's coming from through the public address and they're not able to derive my private key.

[16:54] **Marc the Shark**: And then that brings in a good segue for what smart contracts are. So traditionally, when you get sent tokens into like the boxes in your wallet, they're only spendable if you sign that transaction but now smart contracts are another layer to that to where you can sign and say hey i'm going to send this to tim but or this other condition is true. So for example, say you have some type of delayed dispersion. So like in 10 minutes, I'm going to send this amount to Tim, or I can send it right now. But otherwise it can get spent by Tim and then you can run what's called off chain bots to then collect those boxes are then spendable. And then they send that to Tim automatically. And so then that's where the programmatic sort of idea comes into play.

[17:47] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, and pretty much every real world financial asset or application. You can think of borrowing, lending, derivatives, baskets of things. You could build all of those things to be done automatically with a smart contract. So Mark might want to borrow some money because he wants to go short or long some other asset and the contract would enable that as well as like a ton of other things.

[18:28] **Wade**: The idea of smart contracts really seems fascinating to me too and something I've talked with people about for a while would help in my business to automate certain things when it comes to collecting payments from clients. Again, I think you'd have to see a lot more mass adoption of, I think, the underlying assets by clients of mine that are a lot less tech savvy than I am in some cases. But I think the concept is super promising.

[18:59] **Marc the Shark**: And even from a security standpoint, right? So, kind of differing from chain to chain, we have different smart contract languages that are able to write these contracts. So Ethereum is notable for the languages escaping me. Anyways, but they can be not hacked but people write in within so on Ergo it's called a Sigma prop. And so the Sigma prop if true that box gets to be spendable. Now on Ethereum I'm not sure what the case is but people are able to put sort of an or statement so then if that becomes true, you can then spend that on Ethereum and that's how people get hacked for like millions of dollars because they put so much money into a proxy contract. So another entity kind of holding these funds, these boxes, I guess it's different on Ethereum. But then because of that sort of flaw within the smart contract is then able to leak funds from that contract unexpectedly.

[20:01] **tmr.erg**: Speaking of adoption and losing your money, what doubts and reservations do you have about crypto broadly, Wade? You're what we call a normie and a no-coiner. What gives, man?

[20:21] **Wade**: I mean, yeah, full disclosure for the audience right now, I'm not holding any coins or anything, any crypto. Yeah, puts me kind of on the outside as someone who is interested in it. But I think just my risk tolerance for this point, I've done pretty okay and stock investing over the last six, seven years of my career, we had a pretty bullish stock market as well, which has enabled me to buy some real world assets too with that. And I've kind of just been taking the tortoise or the hare philosophy a lot when it comes to that, the slow and steady wins the race.

But I am interested in the technology itself of cryptocurrency and its future use potentials. And I think we're getting a lot closer to a point where I think enough people have heard and understand about it that it's making more and more sense as time goes on, especially with, I think, the positive outlook that we're going to have over the next four years in the US and how a lot of people are now are even more bullish about Bitcoin because of this new administration that we could have a lot more adoption of it, which makes it more inherently viable and makes more sense for people to hold when there's a lot more hands that it could be exchanged from.

I think more reservations I have about it is if, I was talking to my brother about this concept a little bit. We're talking about, well, the idea of investing in something like gold, for example, not even Bitcoin, but gold said, okay, well, if I want to invest in something like gold to hedge against a downturn in the market, I could buy a gold that the point would be to buy a gold bar, not just a gold exchange fund, because then you're losing the utility of that. If the stock market goes down, if the networks go down, you don't even have access to that. So you want a gold bar, but then if you have a gold bar and now you want to exchange that for food it's kind of hard to break that bar up for food right so then i think of i the closest thing i can compare bitcoin to and this might not be completely accurate would be gold it's a great store of some value and some proof of that energy expenditure i think if i wanted some other form of reserve besides the stock market in case the stock market would crash or the network fails or weren't even worse scenario in the world, is thinking of like a prepper mindset, then I probably wouldn't be able to access that or exchange that between people either, I fear.

So if it came down to the apocalypse or something like that, I'd probably rather have a pack of cigarettes to try to trade people, or a can of food or gas in that way, because that's what I think of people would have some sort of value. I watched some prison shows talking about the currencies that they've developed there between them without actual other physical money and come down to bartering. So if it was the end of the world, I'd probably rather have a gas can than a million dollars of Bitcoin in my digital wallet that I can't even turn on potentially.

But I don't think it doesn't have value today, but I think just to me, and I'm not even that much of a doomsday property to begin with, but I think until that scenario happens that I still have lights like my traditional stock investments as a place to fairly safely keep some savings.

[23:54] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, I mean, everything you said is totally reasonable, dude. So I guess I'll go back like from the beginning. So you said it's funny how the bigger it gets, like the more valid it kind of becomes, which is a little bit inverse to some stocks, right? Like we see Nvidia and the chart is like going like this and you're like, that's probably a bubble. But now we see Bitcoin doing that. It's like knocking on the door of 100K today and like, oh, that means it's more valid and it's probably safer to invest in than it was at $15K, which is just inverse. It's like a different mode of thinking about Bitcoin versus stocks.

[24:41] **Wade**: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think it also just the volume of trades at any way. And the fact that it's still with Bitcoin, as far as I know and understand, you don't have to trade a full coin like you do with a full stock. You don't have to buy one share. You can buy a partial.

[24:59] **tmr.erg**: Divisible to a million parts. Yeah. Right. So another thing that you said that was good, there's a good analogy. You're like, oh, if I have the gold ETF, I don't actually have any gold. We say not your keys, not your coins. So yeah, man, like if you don't have the actual asset, it's like you're trusting somebody or some system to uphold your value that you're trying to save. And that's a risk. It's a counterparty risk, for sure.

[25:48] **Wade**: Yeah, like having I also thought that too about cryptocurrency, I think in a point to where, and like I said, I've traded some on Robinhood in the past when I was, I think, kind of popular in its own way. And then I realized ultimately that I'm not holding that true asset, I'm just buying their holding of it basically. So I think it would be important, I think, for my future self to obtain crypto assets to actually have it in my own wallet as well, like you're saying.

[26:21] **tmr.erg**: Yeah. So your last point was about kind of like that worst case scenario. How would crypto actually be useful? Which is actually a good thought exercise. I think like real worst case scenario, yeah, like, internet's gone. Electricity is only available if you have a solar panel. That's like a real problem. But I think a lot of people would be really messed up in that case then too.

And then I'm also kind of thinking about Bitcoin as probably the most resilient money there that's digital. So as we approach that limit, everything is going to fly to that safety. And so in that process, it would become more valuable. We still have things like Starlink and every other satellite internet provider or whatever. That would be online for a while. And then also thinking about some technologies that are developed on Ergo, it's like you could make transactions with email and flip phone. We were even talking about could you program it to use radio waves? Like a ham radio, could you put out a signal that somebody would be able to interpret as a transaction? Which is pretty low tech in terms of hardware requirements and energy requirements. Cool to think about.

[28:03] **Marc the Shark**: Scary. You still need a node, I guess, at the end of the day. As long as there's one person that can kind of broadcast, hey, connect to my node and we can facilitate this transaction for you.

But what's interesting about Bitcoin, I guess, also would be the fact that as more people flock to it, it becomes probably more resilient, right in the price. So probably less volatility kind of over time, similarity, I guess, to gold in some sense, because, and especially if there is, I guess, some sort of apocalyptic type tragedy that would happen. then effectively the less people would be mining it right and so less people mining it then the fixed supply just gets just got really more fixed in some sense and so would probably protect the value of it.

Whereas other currencies, like the idea with gold is, well, there's only so much gold. And then back in the day, they were trading seashells or they were making these stones and things like that. Well, until new tech came along and was like, oh, well, I can collect seashells faster now. And so that just crashed the currency and things like that. I think with Bitcoin, it kind of protects that, right? Because of mining, mining protects that new supply coming in. So this is going to be a limited amount of stock relative to.

[29:35] **Wade**: Yeah, no, that's a good point, Mark. I think the supply would be fixed then and demand would, the demand, I think part of it is what, the supply is a good argument to make. And I think that's extremely solid. The demand part of it, I'm not sure would be there because I wonder what the minimum equipment requirements would be to exchange hands of it then because if I had a dollar in my hand, for example, I all I have to do is hand that to you. If I have a coin, do I have to have a and again, I know this is like the worst case scenario and probably not going to happen. But I did just live through two hurricanes in Florida where I lost power for five days. I tell you what, there was lines around the corner, gas stations waiting for gas and my generator was extremely helpful to be able to use here.

So I might need a generator, I might need a laptop or a phone to power that and maybe some sort of Starlink or cell service for internet. In that case, it's probably the minimum you might need to exchange crypto in that case. I think again, I think that's just an extreme case of that. And I think most of my investing philosophy is just way more cautious, but I again, I do think the technology has crazy potential. And I'm here talking about it, because I do think it's very interesting and could have a lot more value in the future as it does today. And not only just to us, but future generations might find more value and I think it's ultimately up to the masses like that to decide what direction we want to go in and I think people are betting with their money right now that this could be one of those avenues.

[31:20] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, and I think relative to stocks, right? So Bitcoin is very much this hard money asset, whereas stocks is kind of people, I wouldn't say it's hard money, right? Because if you think about it, people say there's a fixed supply of like Tesla or Nvidia, but that's not necessarily true, right? Because every five years, every three years, they do a stock split, and it's effectively adding 10 times more of the stock supply, and they're just essentially printing stock, whereas Bitcoin and even Ergo, it's less so and then specifically bitcoin and ergo the hardware requirements to set up this sort of stuff is a lot cheaper and easier people are selling these miners and then they break within like the first few months and they cost like ten thousand dollars not super ideal and in a similar case for some of these stocks in order to buy like At one point, what was it, NVIDIA, it was like $1,300 or something. That's a little outrageous, but of course, Bitcoin's 90 something thousand now and that's, so that's not really ideal, but the idea that you can be divisible by like all these different sort of units of time, but then also Bitcoin can't go bad.

You can buy a million dollars worth of gas, but probably will go bad in a few months or you could buy a million dollars worth of cigarettes, but if it rains on the cigarettes, that's a lot of cigarettes to buy, and so from Bitcoin is able to translate over time but also space but then also corruption in terms of like the environment and not political corruption but just you can't corrode Bitcoin just like gold right and so in a similar sense right you can see that sort of split between all the different gold silver copper within the coins transfer of those assets they're able to translate space go across the world sort of thing and still kind of maintain their value and that's something I think a lot of people want, right?

I would say it's less so of like number go up, but more of just like, let's preserve my value, because right now the governments, who knows what they're gonna do, and I just wanna preserve my assets, whatever those assets are, and not have them go down, or just like slowly go down over time, right?

[33:33] **tmr.erg**: So something I say is the point of crypto is not to make you rich, but to make you free. So we're at the beginning of that adoption curve, and so the investment potential is there, but that's not the point. The point is to give people another option that's not controlled or manipulated by others, and the supply of dollars or stocks is controlled by people, and the supply of Bitcoin is controlled by code. And so it's not up for debate about what it is and what's gonna happen.

So that being said, I like to talk to people about why having a hard cap supply is important. I don't necessarily think that Bitcoin would be the world's reserve currency. I don't know. That's not like my base case. I kind of think the main benefit is just having another currency to compete with all the other currencies so that it holds them honest, right? Because I think something like 70% of all the dollars were printed in the past like five years. So like, that's mind blowing, right? That's a lot of dollars. And who knows what the effect is going to be like they just did it because they felt like they had to. And so as somebody who's forced to use those dollars, I should have a choice to like have this other thing. And I feel like Bitcoin and cryptos that are specifically proof of work. They kind of just give me an option where I know the outcome. I know what it is. I can verify all the parameters. And whereas the dollar, I know that it's going to be accepted. They just changed the definition of M2, which is like the money supply in the past few years. You look up M2 on the chart and it's like, and they're like, oh, we don't use this anymore. They're like, yeah, I bet.

[35:43] **Wade**: That's a great point, Tim. Yeah, you don't have control over that other lever then that's so important to economic supply and demand that that other lever gets pulled in the wrong direction for majority of people that are forced to use this currency. I think you make a really good case when you cite examples of hyperinflation in some South American countries if you look at what's happened down there in certain places where they have just inflated the crap out of their currency to where the spending power has just become so insignificant in some ways that it's millions of dollars in whatever currency that is for a loaf of bread or whatever that may be. So I think there's a great case for crypto that you're making in that way. And then one that I think principally, I do believe a lot.

And I think maybe if I'm allowed to segue this into another category, we talked about the top one a lot, Bitcoin, that's obviously the biggest market cap. How does that trickle down? And what need for other blockchains have come out of that or have been invented after that and maybe help explain to me some of the other use cases of different coins or maybe especially Ergo in your guys case.

[37:44] **tmr.erg**: Yeah. So I think Mark kind of hit on it a little bit previously where originally Bitcoin was really just a tool for transacting and sending and receiving those coins and had to do that manually. It didn't have that smart contract functionality that we talked about. So in 2015 or 2016, Ethereum came out and that was really the first smart contract application that arose. And just kind of being the first one, it had a lot of flaws. We found that there are more efficient ways to do things, more secure ways to do things. And that has led us to Ergo, where it's kind of, it's doing a lot of things, right?

So when I introduce people to crypto, I tell them there's a lot of scams. A lot of people are just trying to make your money and they're not very transparent about what they're selling you and so Ergo one for me was just a line with my values like everything is open source like there is a team that they received very little money in terms of like the whole coin allocation they got like 4% of all the tokens and they they publish a verifiable budget and like expense everything like you can see every dollar that they've spent. So that to me just made a lot of sense and it made it really clear.

And then overall the goal is to reduce the technological requirements as much as possible so as many people around the world can access it as possible. And then with that, they don't take any technological risks. So they only use cryptographic principles that are proven, starting with Bitcoin. So they basically took Bitcoin's code and took the most the safest, most proven aspects of that and then kind of built on top of it without inventing the wheel again and trying to accomplish something that's not proven. So it's like, no, if we don't know that it's secure, we're not going to do that.

[40:12] **Marc the Shark**: and and then like from other tokens right so you have litecoin you have doge those are just mere copies literal copies of the same so it's a fork is what it's called so you can have the same consensus and then some miners can then say hey we're going to go over here in this lane But we're going to call this Litecoin. And so then they facilitate Litecoin, new miners stand up, new mining rigs for here. And so now you have a new blockchain kind of entirely. So Dogecoin was done, I think was the official first meme coin. Litecoin was to be like, hey, or like silver, so to speak.

And then you have all these other sort of paradigms that kind of switch to where Like we were talking earlier, Bitcoin was the CPU miner. Then we moved the GPUs and then quickly moved into ASICs. So application specific integrated circuit. All they can do is mine Bitcoin, literally nothing else. And so as that quickly started to get stood up, it's like 10K now for a Bitcoin miner. Not really, like Tim was saying, like not really accessible to the general population, right? And so what is really cool about crypto or Ergo is the fact that you can buy a A GPU now for like a couple hundred bucks right you can put up maybe hook that up I saw somebody hooked hooked up an AMD GPU to Raspberry Pi and then you can be on your way start collecting mining tokens and things like that and so from an accessibility perspective super important.

And then just the smart contract layer compared to Ethereum to Ergo, Ethereum has what's called gas fees and these gas fees can be like maybe 20 bucks to a hundred bucks and you're maybe trying to send like five. So you're spending more in transaction fees than you are actually in what you're trying to transact. And then an additional note is that you can try to send this and it can fail and then you lose everything. Like you don't get that back. I'm not really sure where it goes, but like, so it, and that sucks, right? If I want to send you some money, I want to know that you're going to get it. Not that it fails and then it doesn't work.

So talking to Ergo, if it doesn't send, it doesn't send. There's no like, oh, is it not, is it? And then additionally, for one transaction, it costs, one, 1000th of a ERG. So it's 0.001. And ERG right now is like $1.40. And so super cheap to transact. So if you wanted to send a million dollars, it's going to cost you 0.01 ERG just to send it to a given address.

And then other things, you can see there's more copies. Or there's different consensus protocols. So we have proof of work. That's what we're actively talking about with all these tokens that we are coins rather that we've talked about. But then there's proof of stake, which is a different consensus mechanism. So Cardano is primarily proof of stake. Ethereum moved the proof of stake. And so basically what that basically is is you need to buy a specific asset. You need to hold that asset. And then those, you run some code by putting those assets in there. And then that is sort of facilitates the consensus protocol. And so you have what's called stake pools. And so you have stake pool operators and you can stake your ADA onto those stake pools. And then those find the blocks and then those facilitate the transactions.

There's some key to debate sometimes between what's more secure, proof of stake, proof of work. I like proof of work because, again, it goes back to that accessibility perspective. So if you wanted to set up a mining pool, Wade, all you would have to do is just run some code. You don't even have to be a miner. You don't have to run any type of mining equipment, but you could set up your own mining pool. But if you wanted to be a stake pool operator, you need millions of ADA. And so ADA is like, 70 cents right now. That's a lot of fucking money. Excuse my French, just to get so it's like, it's art, so if you wanted to be a stakeholder, you need to be on it from the very early on. Whereas right now, if you wanted to be a mining pool operator, it's easy to do and will always ever be easy to do. So I think kind of going back to why Ergo, why we like really Ergo is like the principles, it's for the people, it's not really like, oh, if you have a lot of money, we're going to favor you like other chains might, we're really for like that accessibility perspective and kind of putting that power into the people and having, I guess, less attack vectors to that, right.

[44:53] **Wade**: Accessibility is huge for more adoption of these ideas.

[45:01] **tmr.erg**: The critique of Proof of Stake that I like the most is just that you have 10% of all the coins on the proof of stake and you stake those, you're always going to have 10% of the coins because you earn interest for holding, for staking those tokens. And so it's not really a level playing field for people entering the space, like Mark said. So for a group of work, it's like you might have all these miners set up. But difficulty increases over time. Technology increases over time. And so new entrants kind of really get the edge. They get the advantage. In five years from now, the quality of solar panels and graphics cards and just literally everything is going to give that person the advantage over whoever's been mining for the last five years. They might have more coins, but their production capability is going to be way higher.

[46:09] **Marc the Shark**: Right. It's kind of like easy money in that sense, right? Where the idea, I guess, of easy money is, there's these people, select few, right, who have a huge pile of this given asset, a huge stockpile, and then they're selling it to these newcomers, right, at a higher price and then versus hard money, right? It's it's fixed. It's easy to get on board. If you haven't read the Bitcoin standard, I'd read it and read it again. Really great book.

[46:42] **tmr.erg**: The book I recommend people is Broken Money by Lynn Alden. That was really good. She kind of goes through the history of money and talking about seashells and gold and then credit systems and fiat and all this stuff and the challenges with each and how crypto can solve those challenges. I thought it was great and she has a lot of content online. Yeah, that's who I recommend Newton's to.

[47:11] **Wade**: I'll check some of those out.

[47:13] **tmr.erg**: So Wade, maybe just to end, I'm wondering, do you have any advice for us about how to talk to people who aren't interested? Because, I don't know when this will come out, but Thanksgiving's coming up and people are gonna be like, Hey, am I bitcoins doing awesome? How do we talk to people who aren't into crypto? Like, did we do a good job? Or do you have any any recommendations?

[47:38] **Wade**: That's a really good question. And you're right. There's probably a lot of Thanksgiving conversations happening around who's doing really well in this and who's upset at other things. Maybe my ideas or perspective is making it less seem like an exclusive club. And I don't think it necessarily is, but I think there is some technological facade to some people when no one questions holding or having fiat currency, people might be more or less savvy with it, but no one doesn't understand having the value of a dollar to food to X, Y, and Z.

So I think making it more analogous with other types of currency maybe seeing more transactions happen with this type of currency, instead of something that's maybe outside of that realm altogether seems really helpful. I think there's certain words to or certain lingo when it comes to things like that that make it seem with crypto that makes it seem a little more complicated than it has to be to probably ones that we've even discussed today that I might understand, but to a bigger audience, maybe such as even just the blockchain or wallets and digital wallets in that way, maybe, maybe not. Digital wallet does try to do a good job of equating what that means.

I think a good- Still seems like a club in some certain ways that, I understand there's a big community aspect to get things off the ground, like that too and what it's taken to get to this point, but I don't really think it has to be, and none of it is to me inherently exclusive either, to adopt, to buy, to exchange. in those ways, but there is just some really benign observations on, on my end, but again, I could be far off from what other people think or dismiss about it too. So I'm just here to offer one other perspective on it.

[49:59] **tmr.erg**: No, that's super helpful, man. And I think a goal that we have is to make the application so that people don't even know that they're using crypto or a blockchain. It's like when we send money on Venmo or whatever, I'm not thinking about code or there's no lingo that I use. I'm just like, no, send me 10 bucks for this pizza I bought you. And that's it. So once we get to that point, I think that'll kind of alleviate what you're saying there.

[50:26] **Wade**: Yeah, completely. Yeah, it doesn't even think you don't even see physical money when you send stuff over that online. So there's no reason to me why that couldn't also be done on a different sort of exchange in that way that could involve crypto more than more than likely in the future.

[50:44] **Marc the Shark**: Would you say even to it's maybe more of a or not more of a but it could be kind of an educational thing to where kind of understanding the pros and cons of certain like money systems, like you were saying, like, why did the South American countries sort of fail with respect to, I think there's a lot of sort of things happening in the country and the world, so it's kind of hard to tune into specific things as well, right? So especially on the day to day live too, right? So, I don't know, what do you think there?

[51:18] **Wade**: Yeah, it's hard to spread any idea that far. It seems like there's a lot of other noise that happens in the world right now with gaming content or anything else. I think just finding ways to use it in everyday life that would be applicable to people to be able to see how this actually applies in certain ways, instead of just conceptually, but practically as well if you go to the store and I use, Apple Pay, touch to pay, then you don't see any go across even your credit card, for example, it's just happening somewhere else, being able to do that on, potentially another currency, even having gone to Europe and using an American credit card, it's possible to do that. There's just a small fee that comes off. There's an automatic translation that happens there, a conversion between the currencies. And I don't know what the technological capabilities of that are right now. I'm sure it's possible, but be able to integrate that with normal everyday life at some point for people.

[52:34] **Wade**: We already got it, brother.

[52:36] **tmr.erg**: They call it Babel fees. So you can choose to spend whatever currency you want and then it'll make the transaction on the back end and you don't even know that it happened. It'll just tell you how much it cost.

[52:49] **Wade**: Yeah, cool. Yeah, see, that's something that I haven't experienced with Paul and I'm sure it would be really cool to see used in person. And if I saw, Mark using that in person, other people around me, then I think just seeing being able to see that firsthand, too, I think, would make a lot more people comfortable with, with the ideas and other currency.

[53:09] **Marc the Shark**: So I think, Wade, what we'll have to do is I'll have to come over at some point and we can set up your GPU to maybe mine at night so we can start getting your Ergo coming in.

[53:24] **Wade**: old gaming computer here that I'm not using right now. It's sitting on the floor. So there we go.

[53:31] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, let's do it, man. Let's get you some ERG.

[53:35] **Wade**: Definitely interested. I would be interested to the difference of the energy cost verse, the outputs, but I think that might be very region specific to in a lot of ways. Yeah, definitely. At least worth to experiment for me.

[53:49] **tmr.erg**: All right, we'll have you on in the future and you can tell us your experience as a fresh set of eyes.

[53:57] **Wade**: Yeah, that'd be great. All right, good talking to you guys and good to hear what you guys are up to and some stuff I learned today too that I wasn't really sure about, but I think the best way would be just dipping your toes and learning something new.

[54:13] **tmr.erg**: That's it, man. I feel the same way. I just like learn. I love to learn. And so I meet people like Mark, and they can explain one little thing at a time. And over the years, I feel like I've opened my mind to a lot of things and just learned a ton. So it's a cool place to kind of just spend some free time.

[54:34] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, and our community is just so great. I really enjoy talking with Tim. Obviously, you as well, Wade, and if you join us in the Telegram or Discord groups and ever have a question. people are just so overly helpful and willing just to kind of clarify certain points, which that's a common reoccurrence within our community that we hear. And we're not really gonna point you to, oh, hey, go buy this token, you're gonna make a million bucks or whatever, right? We're not really trying to do anything like that, but if you need to understand a concept or anything, really, people are just so, so, so helpful. So hope to see you in the chats, bud.

[55:11] **Wade**: Thanks, guys.

[55:13] **Marc the Shark**: Have a great day.

[55:15] **Wade**: See you, everyone.
