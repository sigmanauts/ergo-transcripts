      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "ZenGate is a technology company utilizing Web2 and Web3 technologies to fulfill opportunity inclusion for MSMEs (micro, small and mid-sized enterprises), which are businesses that mostly produce commodities. Our core mission is real world impact (RWI), and we've created the Palmyra ecosystem to provide market access, traceability, authentication, and logistics to connect commodity producers directly with buyers, cutting out waste and inefficiencies.",

      "question": "Why use blockchain for commodity traceability instead of a proprietary system?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "One of the core components is immutable traceability. One of the main issues with commodity trade is the lack of transparency and traceability, which leads to adulteration and counterfeiting. For example, with honey - statistically one of the most adulterated foodstuffs in the world - potentially almost 80% of all honey in the West is not real honey but honey flavored syrup. Blockchain creates the transparency needed to track products from producer to consumer.",

      "question": "How does ZenGate's traceability system work technically?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "We have the Winter Protocol, which was built on Ergo as a full traceability and tokenization protocol. This protocol tracks and traces commodities literally from the source - for example, the actual beehive is on chain for honey - all the way to when it ends up with the consumer. The protocol handles the immutable recording of each step in the supply chain process.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "Using Palmyra Pro, we can record data starting from the orchard - registering different tea sites, pH and weather patterns during growth, elevation levels (low, mid, high), picking method (machine vs hand picked), which part of the tea leaf was picked, time of day, humidity during curing, dehydration process, storage conditions using IoT devices, and packaging information. All this creates unique taste variants and ensures premium consistency.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "The European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) goes into effect next year and will require mandatory traceability information for about a dozen essential commodities to be sold in the EU. If producers don't have this information, they cannot sell in the EU, and if they try to sell without compliance, they could be permanently banned from the EU market. The EU didn't specify which system to use - they just require traceability information.",

      "question": "What prevents competitors from easily copying ZenGate's approach since blockchain data is public?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "It's not just about the information on chain, but how it gets there. You need a minimum viable ecosystem (MVE) which includes trained people, onboarded users on Palmyra Pro, established processes, integration, and understanding the nuances of each producer's use case. The value comes from the experience, UX, and ecosystem around the functionality - you can't copy and paste an ecosystem, it has to be built organically.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "It was straightforward to build on Ergo compared to other blockchains. Development was much faster - there are examples of projects taking a week on Ergo versus four weeks on Cardano or months on Ethereum. The development environment and tools made it accessible, and the community was very helpful in explaining how to utilize the different tools on Ergo.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "I always say that Ergo is the US Steel of blockchains - you might not know it by name, but a bunch of stuff that you use is built with it. This puts it as one of the core building blocks of the entire blockchain movement. I believe others should spend their time, money and energy building businesses on Ergo because that's what the ecosystem really needs.",
