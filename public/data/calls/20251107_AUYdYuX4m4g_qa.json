      "question": "How does Ergo's GPU mining relate to AI inference and what opportunities does this create?",
      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "Ergo is GPU minable, which creates natural intersections with AI inference since both use similar hardware. Currently payments in AI are mostly corporate owned, which isn't acceptable. The Ergo community has been working on programmable money for years and has many useful solutions that could be applied to the AI space, creating opportunities for decentralized AI payments.",

      "asker": "qx",
      "answer": "It's a scavenger hunt type game where you solve three problems, probably with AI help. Players pay 20 ERG to participate (15 goes to pot, 5 to treasury). There are three guardians: yes-no oracle, narrative escape, and sigma-not guardian. Each completed guardian rewards players with five seed phrases. The pot starts at 200 ERG but grows with participation - with 10 players it could reach 350 ERG.",

      "question": "What happened with the Ergo infrastructure outage and how can dApps become more resilient?",
      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "There was a billing issue with Hetzner that took down some infrastructure, but Ergo has eight other backup explorers. The solution is for dApps to use rollover techniques - if they can't reach one explorer, automatically try others. Future plans include Cloudflare load balancing across 10-12 explorer instances globally, with dApps having direct access to individual load balancers as backup if the main load balancer fails.",

      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "Three community machines have been shipped out and are syncing nodes. Once database optimizations are completed and tested, the infrastructure will transition from the current $700/month centralized setup to community-run peer-to-peer nodes. This will make Ergo's infrastructure completely decentralized and resilient to outages like the recent AWS crash that affected other blockchains.",

The team is looking for maintainers of Ergo Wallet, particularly to update the Android SDK and publish new versions. They're also considering adding multi-sig support to Ergo Wallet and publishing the MHS monitor mobile wallet.",

      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "For humans, it's not convenient to operate with hundreds of tokens in a wallet, but for AI agents, this is trivial. Money for AI systems could be designed very differently from current wallets, potentially leading to more efficient economic interactions. This is being considered for future wallet designs.",

      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "CLB is a community liquidity bootstrap event where people contribute ERG from Ergo and rsERG from Cardano. Contributors receive CLB tokens proportionally to their contribution plus bonus airdrops. Only 100 CLB tokens will be minted (with 9 decimals), representing shares in the liquidity pool. The goal is to collect 300,000-400,000 ERG, making each full token worth about 3,000 ERG. The liquidity is locked for 2 years while CLB tokens can be traded on secondary markets.",

      "asker": "Grayman",
      "answer": "CLB participants get their proportional CLB tokens, bonus airdrops worth 5-10% of contribution, and accumulated trading fees over 2 years. The liquidity pool charges 0.3% fees that accumulate for CLB holders. There will be a secondary market for CLB tokens on Ergo DEXes, so participants can sell early if desired or buy more tokens to increase their liquidity pool share. After 2 years, CLB tokens can be redeemed for LP tokens to withdraw liquidity plus accumulated fees.",

      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "All current stablecoins are basically centralized, even attempts like Athena have centralized resources. USE/Dexy has a very unique design with great minds behind it. The launch itself (CLB event) is unique in DeFi space - they're not copy-pasting from Ethereum but creating something genuinely novel. It will work with Rosen Bridge for wide distribution and aims to capture mainstream attention since people understand '$1 stablecoin' easily.",

      "question": "How does Ergo's privacy approach differ from other privacy coins that are currently trending?",
      "asker": "Grayman via Mohit Tanwar",
      "answer": "Ergo has optional privacy at the application layer through ErgoScript, including native support for thresholds, ring signatures with zero-knowledge properties, multi-sig, ErgoMixer (non-custodial and non-interactive), and stealth addresses. This differs from mandatory privacy coins. Optional privacy means optional transparency too, which is important for public money systems and regulatory compliance while still allowing business-level privacy when needed.",

      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "Ergo has native support for thresholds and ring signatures with zero-knowledge properties preserved (unlike Bitcoin), multi-sig capabilities, ErgoMixer as a non-custodial and non-interactive tool to restore coin fungibility, and stealth addresses for recipient privacy. As far as kushti knows, Ergo is the only blockchain with such comprehensive privacy properties built-in.",

      "question": "Why isn't ErgoMixer more widely used and how could it be improved?",
      "asker": "Grayman",
      "answer": "ErgoMixer isn't very easy to use for non-technical users - it feels like 'a bridge too far.' It could be a good candidate for a dApp in a browser wallet or mobile wallet to make it more accessible. However, it should never be too easy since people should think about what they're doing and understand their security assumptions. The mixer also requires counterparties for large amounts and has complex practices that need optimization.",
