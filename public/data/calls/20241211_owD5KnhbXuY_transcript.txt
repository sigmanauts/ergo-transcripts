[00:10] **Gvuldis**: Hey guys, I'm Gvuldis from the team Kropli and we are here to introduce you to On-Ergo.

[00:18] **Gvuldis**: It is an amazing tool that we are building here on Ergo and I hope that you guys enjoy and find it useful.

[00:26] **Gvuldis**: So let's start our presentation by talking about the problems that we are going to address.

[00:31] **Gvuldis**: I'm fairly sure that most of you guys have seen what has happened with Cardano over the last few years since it is of course our testnet. It started well with a wallet and then boom, it was overwhelming so quickly and it was basically impossible to stay updated on most developments.

[00:50] **Gvuldis**: This was at least my experience, I don't know about you guys, but we believe that Ergo, though considerably smaller right now, is going to end up on the same path and face this same problem.

[01:02] **Gvuldis**: And we believe that it is better to solve this problem sooner rather than later. And Cardano, as far as I know, still doesn't have the solution for this. That's why we are here right now.

[01:14] **Gvuldis**: One more problem that inexperienced people face in crypto is that things are much more complicated than we as professional community members think. The reality is that most people investing in crypto will never withdraw their coins from centralized exchanges because, well, it is simply too complicated at this stage of time.

[01:35] **Gvuldis**: As of now, there isn't really a clear, consistent guide for navigating the ecosystem and exploring all the opportunities that it provides or will provide in the future. And newcomers are just scared to make mistakes with their money. They need to be encouraged somehow, in some way. And marketing, when?

[01:55] **Gvuldis**: So on Ergo, our solution to these problems that we started to create during Ergo Hack 9 will provide both new and experienced users with an event calendar, an educational platform, a Discord bot, and with some very nice incentives to get people to discover new possibilities on-chain.

[02:14] **Gvuldis**: Let's take a look at them separately with more details. First of all, an event calendar. Whether it's community meetups, dApp launches, updates, or special events, everything gets listed here. And it's super easy for projects as well as community members to add events themselves.

[02:31] **Gvuldis**: We are still polishing the details and permissions for adding events. However, we want to make those rules as decentralized as possible. For now, possible solutions include a Discord bot integration or NFTs, granting the possibility to post. So you'll always know what's happening, when and where.

[02:51] **Gvuldis**: Imagine not having to dig through 10 different channels or announcements, it's all here in one place, and you don't have to miss anything. We are aware that this might not be as useful at the moment, however, as I mentioned before, this can become very useful with several project pre-sales launching at the same time during Ergo's exponential growth.

[03:15] **Gvuldis**: Here you can see a small preview of the very early stage development that we have done so far on the event calendar.

[03:31] **Gvuldis**: So, besides just keeping you informed, we want to help everyone learn about Ergo too. That's where our educational platform comes in. We are creating a quest roadmap. It's kind of like a game where each quest is a learning opportunity.

[03:45] **Gvuldis**: For example, your first quest might be something as simple as creating a wallet, then maybe sending your first transaction or integrating with the app. Each completed quest brings rewards. So you're not just learning, you're playing a game and earning along the way.

[04:03] **Gvuldis**: Our goal here is to build confidence and knowledge, guiding you from a newbie to a Sigmanauts, step by step. We have made some of these roadmaps, however we don't want to reveal too much so that we can make the launch even more exciting.

[04:20] **Gvuldis**: Here's a small preview of a start of a potential quest roadmap on the educational platform about the Cyberverse game. Each new quest unlocks after the previous has been finished. And this is basically how a start of such roadmap could look like.

[04:36] **Gvuldis**: Our Discord bot is like the backbone of this whole experience. It's integrated with the platform and acts as an assistant for the community. Let's say you're curious about upcoming events. Just type slash events and it will list everything that's on the calendar.

[04:52] **Gvuldis**: Projects can also use the bot to add events directly with a slash add event, making it instantly accessible to the whole community. As I already mentioned, we are thinking of possible solutions for adding events, and one more possibility would be to integrate this Discord bot in Ergo ecosystem's Discord servers, make them follow the announcement pages, let the posts go through AI check, and automatically add the event mentioned in the announcement to On-Ergo's calendar.

[05:20] **Gvuldis**: We are exploring many options and we will make sure to choose the best one with the help of Ergo's community and its feedback.

[05:27] **Gvuldis**: Now, what's a community platform without some incentives, right? We are going to have leaderboards, raffles and rewards to keep things fun and engaging. So, if you're completing quests, attending events or just actively participating in the ecosystem, you'll be recognized for it, and who doesn't love a bit of friendly competition.

[05:48] **Gvuldis**: These incentives are all about building a healthy, active community where everyone's excited to contribute and engage.

[05:56] **Gvuldis**: On-Ergo is more than just a platform. It's an innovative approach to managing and navigating the Ergo ecosystem. We are combining event management, gamified onboarding, and DeFi accessibility all in one. We're creating an ecosystem hub that doesn't just give you information but actually helps you experience the ecosystem hands-on.

[06:18] **Gvuldis**: This innovation is all about making Ergo user-friendly and accessible from beginners to seasoned pros.

[06:25] **Gvuldis**: Our community is at the core of everything we are building with On-Ergo. This platform is designed to grow and evolve with community input. We want to hear from you, your ideas, your feedback, your events. On-Ergo will make it easy to organize and promote community-led events, building a central hub for the entire Ergo family.

[06:47] **Gvuldis**: Together, we'll create a thriving, connected ecosystem where everyone can get involved.

[06:53] **Gvuldis**: So who will actually benefit from this? First of all newcomers, because On-Ergo simplifies the entry into Ergo with guided learning and easy-to-find events. Then the community, because the platform helps by summarizing all updates and events in one place.

[07:09] **Gvuldis**: And projects, new projects especially, can gain visibility and engagement with a simple way to list events and updates and, well, On-Ergo strengthens the entire Ergo ecosystem by making it more accessible and pushing people to use the ecosystem more.

[07:27] **Gvuldis**: So, what's next? We're starting with the essentials, the event calendar and the Discord bot to get the foundation in place. Then we'll expand with more educational quests, enhanced incentives and user-driven updates.

[07:42] **Gvuldis**: We are also planning to open source the project later on so the community can contribute directly. This roadmap is flexible. As we grow and get feedback, we'll keep adapting and improving to make sure that we are meeting the needs of the community.

[07:59] **Gvuldis**: In summary, On-Ergo is here to bring the Ergo ecosystem together, all in one place. Whether you're looking for events, educational resources or community incentives, we want On-Ergo to be your go-to hub. Our mission is to make Ergo simple, accessible and engaging for everyone.

[08:19] **Gvuldis**: One ecosystem, one platform, that's On-Ergo. Thank you for being here and let's work together to make the Ergo ecosystem the best it can be. Thank you for letting us participate in this Ergo hack and thank you for attention from On-Ergo.
