# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** February 24, 2025  
**Title:** Ergo PoW Dev Update - Wallet, Node, Reputation, Mining, Rosen Bridge Updates

## Executive Summary

This developer update focused on significant progress across multiple Ergo ecosystem projects, with particular emphasis on the unique value proposition of Ergo's resilient, mindful blockchain architecture. The call highlighted recent security incidents in the broader crypto space (referencing a $1.4 billion hack) as validation for Ergo's careful, security-first approach to development. Key developments included Nautilus wallet's beta release preparation, Ergo node 6.0 final preparations, and the successful launch of the Rosen Bridge mainnet.

A major theme was the innovative Sigmanauts mining DAO - described as unique in the mining community for its democratic governance structure, storage rent collection capabilities, and community-driven approach. The call emphasized how Ergo miners have actual control and voting power over both pool operations and chain parameters, contrasting with other ecosystems where miners face centralized threats.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Nautilus Wallet Progress** - Main interface ported to new design system, beta release planned for next week
• **Ergo Node 6.0** - Final audit and code cleaning underway for major version release
• **SigmaUSD Oracle Pool Update** - Version 2 launching with DORT (Dollar Oracle Reward Tokens) as rewards
• **Rosen Bridge Launch** - Mainnet now live with watcher updates required for all operators
• **Sigmanauts Mining DAO** - Only known pool collecting storage rent (29.7 ERG weekly), offering governance tokens and bonus distributions
• **SharkNet LLM Development** - AI system for generating Ergo smart contracts with community funding of 190 ERG
• **NodeView Enhancements** - Added pop-ups for DEX swaps, SigmaUSD operations, and Rosen Bridge events

## Decisions Made

• Rosen Bridge watchers must update to latest version immediately for continued functionality
• SigmaUSD Oracle v2 will use DORT tokens instead of previously mentioned GORT tokens
• Sigmanauts mining pool received additional 100GB server storage and optimizations
• MewFinance created liquidity fund for Rosen BNB-ERG pairs (~500-1000 ERG total)

## Notable Quotes

> "Moments like that make me very happy that we're in Ergo and we're in it for the long haul, you know, especially through these turbulent times of, you know, VC value extraction and all that, we can sit back and think, you know, we're building something that's resilient, we're building P2P finance for essentially anyone." - **qx()** on recent crypto hacks

> "So far that we know is the only pool essentially that is collecting storage rent, right? It's a DAO-based mining pool. That means once you come in, you get a token that lets you use Paideia and create votes that maybe change miner payout methods for bonus tokens." - **qx()** on Sigmanauts mining DAO uniqueness

> "So imagine either going to a site, paying a few tokens... You type in your prompt, tell it what you want, and boom, it outputs a smart contract that has gone through numerous amounts of training times." - **qx()** describing the SharkNet LLM vision
