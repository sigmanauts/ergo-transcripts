# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** November 29, 2024  
**Title:** Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA - November 28th 2024

## Executive Summary

The weekly Ergo community call featured significant updates on the upcoming 6.0 soft fork proposal (EIP-50), which has been finalized and is ready for miner voting. The soft fork introduces major new features including trustless Bitcoin bridges, Layer 2 capabilities, and enhanced cryptographic operations. The discussion also covered Ergo's unique demurrage (storage rent) mechanism, comparisons with other blockchain solutions like BitcoinOS, and upcoming community engagement initiatives including Twitter Spaces with House of Chimera.

Kushti emphasized Ergo's decentralized governance model, requiring 90%+ miner consensus for protocol changes, and outlined the 3-month activation timeline. The team discussed various outreach formats and the importance of community-driven liquidity provision through tools like Rosen Bridge and upcoming Hummingbot implementations.

## Notable Quotes

**kushti on Ergo's governance**: "Ergo is not centralized cryptocurrency if such term makes sense at all, controlled by dev team so every change is to be voted by miners with 90 percent, 90 plus percent of hash rate voting for is needed for approval."

**qx() on community responsibility**: "The tools are there, guys. We have everything we need. And there's plenty of us... it's us. Like we have the power to take, even if you have like 200 ERGs, it doesn't matter."

**kushti on building for longevity**: "So building a cathedral, not speculative spec mining or whatever speculative one-day story. So that was the goal always implicitly."
