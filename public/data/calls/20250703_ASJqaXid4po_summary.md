# Ergo Community Call Summary: Palmyra & ZenGate Deep Dive

**Call Date:** July 3, 2025  
**Call Title:** Palmyra | Dan and QX() | Ergoversary 2025

## Executive Summary

This Ergoversary community call featured a comprehensive discussion between QX() and Dan Friedman of ZenGate about their blockchain-based commodity traceability platform. ZenGate operates as a technology company focused on opportunity inclusion for micro, small, and mid-sized enterprises (MSMEs), particularly commodity producers in developing economies. Their flagship product, the Palmyra ecosystem, utilizes Ergo blockchain through their Winter Protocol to provide immutable traceability for commodities from production to consumer, addressing widespread issues of adulteration and counterfeiting.

The conversation highlighted real-world applications including a pilot program with Zambian honey producers, where blockchain traceability addresses the fact that potentially 80% of honey in Western markets is adulterated. ZenGate is expanding from B2B operations to direct consumer sales through Palmyra Express, offering traced commodities to the crypto community. Dan emphasized that blockchain adoption requires more than just technology—it demands comprehensive ecosystem building, producer onboarding, and understanding specific industry nuances.
