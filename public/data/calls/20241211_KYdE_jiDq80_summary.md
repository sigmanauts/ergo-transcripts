# Ergo Community Call Summary - December 11, 2024
## Bene | Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo & Jossemii | ErgoHack 9

## Executive Summary

Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo presented Bene, a comprehensive proof-of-funding platform built on Ergo blockchain that enables automated crowdfunding with token-based contribution tracking. The platform allows project owners to deploy funding vaults with customizable parameters (funding token type, minimum amounts, deadlines, and reward rates) while automatically distributing "contribution accounting tokens" or "proof of funding tokens" to contributors. These tokens serve as verifiable proof of participation and can represent various value propositions depending on the project type.

Jossemii demonstrated the platform's user interface, showcasing how projects can be created, funded, and managed through an intuitive web interface. The system supports diverse use cases from charitable donations and crowdfunding to startup funding and event ticket sales, with built-in safety mechanisms that allow contributors to reclaim funds if minimum goals aren't met by specified deadlines.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Platform Mechanics**: Detailed explanation of Bene's funding vault system with parameters for funding tokens, minimum amounts, deadlines, and proof-of-funding token rewards
• **Safety Features**: Contributors can withdraw funds after deadline if minimum funding threshold isn't reached
• **Flexible Token Management**: Project owners can add/remove proof-of-funding tokens at any time during active campaigns
• **Real-world Examples**: Multiple use case scenarios including Stable Order's SDK funding, community article production, and anti-scam protection
• **Versatile Applications**: Platform supports donations, crowdfunding, startup funding, event tickets, and Stable Order's "benefactions" model
• **Live Demonstration**: Interactive walkthrough of creating projects, minting tokens, setting parameters, and making contributions

## Decisions Made

• Bene platform development completed and ready for community use
• Integration with ErgoHack 9 for broader ecosystem exposure
• Social media channels established for community engagement and support

## Notable Quotes

> "The goal of this platform is very simple. It's to enable projects that want to raise funds to do so and to allow contributors who are providing funds to those projects to be rewarded with tokens." - **Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo**

> "So after the deadline, those who had been lured into providing funding for this scam can safely give back their SDBT to get their ERG back." - **Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo** (explaining anti-fraud protection)

> "The original use case that made us develop this platform is this use case of benefactions that we have in Stable Order. This idea that we are working together and contributing to our projects and these contributions may be both in the form of labor and capital and both of these types of contributions are treated equally." - **Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo**
