# Ergoversary Special Community Call Summary
**Date:** July 2, 2025  
**Title:** Ergoversary Special - Weekly Update & AMA - July 1st

## Executive Summary

The Ergo blockchain community celebrated its 6th anniversary during this special community call. Core developer kushti provided significant updates on sub-blocks testing, which is progressing well with successful load testing, and announced upcoming voting for version 6.0 along with another emission reduction proposal. The call featured extensive discussion about the future of conferences and community meetups, with particular excitement around an upcoming Ergo meetup planned for October 11th in Colorado.

Community members shared their history with Ergo, dating back to early IOHK days in 2016-2017, and discussed various projects including community-run node infrastructure, AI integration through MCP (Model Context Protocol), and educational blockchain applications. The atmosphere was celebratory yet focused on technical progress and community building.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Sub-blocks DevNet Update**: Testing going well with successful load testing; public testnet deployment targeted for July 15-25th
• **Version 6.0 Voting**: Upcoming vote on 6.0 release and emission reduction (more aggressive than previous reductions)
• **Community Infrastructure**: Launch of community-run explorer nodes at explore-p2p.ergoplatform.com to reduce reliance on EF-hosted infrastructure
• **AI Integration**: Discussion of MCP implementation for blockchain-AI interactions and autonomous AI agents on Ergo
• **October Meetup**: Planning for Ergo community meetup on October 11th with workshops and networking
• **Conference Strategy**: Debate about traditional crypto conferences vs. focused community meetups and educational sector outreach
• **Merge-mined Sidechains**: Work has begun on design specs and coding for sidechain implementation
• **Educational Applications**: Development of blockchain-based alternatives to proprietary educational tools like iClicker

## Decisions Made

• Community will continue testing sub-blocks on DevNet with kushti providing load testing scripts
• Community-run node infrastructure project will expand to include multiple geographic locations
• October 11th meetup confirmed with workshops and community activities planned
• Focus on educational sector conferences (like Educause) for future blockchain application promotion

## Notable Quotes

**kushti**: "So yeah, well, when Bitcoin was six, for example, I worked with it... I think it was more raw even in regards with multi-sig support... hopefully it's less messy here, at least from my observations."

**Armeanio**: "I think backwards compatibility is underappreciated. Please don't rug the devs."

**qx()**: "I feel like it's like, oh, you're a decentralized peer-to-peer blockchain. Where are your main nodes that everybody points to? Oh, they're hosted by the EF? That to me is like, let's stop that. Let's fix that."
