      "answer": "AI has dangerous hallucinations when writing complex blockchain code. I tried to implement sub-blocks related algorithms with AI, but found it more productive to write code manually than to review AI-generated code with subtle but critical issues. However, AI is great for trivial tasks like writing test variations.",

The hard part is always the actual app itself, not the blockchain integration. You can wrap up endpoints and chain interactions super quickly.",

When they can't deliver physical lithium, it becomes algorithmic, then converts back to backed when delivery is made.",
