# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** August 28, 2025  
**Host:** qx()

## Executive Summary

This community call marked a significant transition for Ergo's weekly AMAs, with qx() announcing that future sessions will shift from official Ergo Foundation-hosted events to fully community-driven, peer-to-peer AMAs. This change aligns with Ergo's broader decentralization efforts, including the InfraDAO initiative that's moving infrastructure off centralized EF servers. The call was intentionally brief, focusing primarily on this announcement and providing updates on ongoing community initiatives.

qx() also demonstrated an innovative AI-powered knowledge base system that could revolutionize how the Ergo community accesses educational content. By processing video tutorials and AMAs with timestamped transcripts, the system allows users to query specific topics and receive direct links to relevant moments in educational videos, potentially making Ergo more accessible to newcomers and improving community engagement.

## Key Discussion Points

• **AMA Format Transition**: Moving from official EF-hosted AMAs to community-driven events starting next week
• **InfraDAO Progress**: Added new member "Stroof" (Oracle runner), now operating geo-load balanced nodes across East Coast US, Australia, and Singapore
• **Kraken Listing Update**: Still pursuing listing options, including potential Rosen-ERG from Cardano as interim solution
• **AI Knowledge Base Demo**: Showcased system that can provide timestamped links to specific moments in educational videos based on user queries
• **Community Engagement**: Call for volunteers to help manage social media accounts, particularly Sigmanauts Twitter account
• **Network Health**: Hashrate reported between 5-8, showing stability

## Decisions Made

• Future AMAs will be community-hosted events with advance promotion (5+ days notice)
• InfraDAO will expand to include additional members, targeting 10-50 participants eventually
• AI knowledge base project will be developed for CodeUTXO hosting
• Community members can volunteer for social media management roles

## Notable Quotes

> "We're moving everything off EF servers with the InfraDAO. Why not take AMAs and move them off the official propped up EF channel to a community event, right?" - **qx()** on decentralization efforts

> "If we can't bootstrap ourselves as a community, then what's the point, right?" - **qx()** on community participation in governance

> "AI is essentially what a lot of the younger generation are using now for, like even their search engines, even like just asking stupid questions. So it's an interface that these kids are really, really used to." - **qx()** on the AI knowledge base initiative
