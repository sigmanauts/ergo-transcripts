# P2Podcast Episode 2 - Ergo Community Call Summary

**Call Date:** 2024-11-04  
**Call Title:** P2Podcast | Episode 2

## Executive Summary

This episode of P2Podcast featured hosts tmr.erg and Marc the Shark discussing current developments in the Ergo blockchain ecosystem. The conversation centered around Ergo's recent emission reduction event, moving from higher block rewards to the current 21 ERG per block, with further reductions planned down to 3 ERG by 2026. The hosts explored how this mirrors but exceeds traditional "halving" events, creating significant pressure on mining economics while potentially driving price appreciation.

A major focus was placed on the regulatory landscape, particularly NiceHash's new KYC requirements and how this reinforces Ergo's core values of permissionless, privacy-focused blockchain infrastructure. The discussion highlighted upcoming solutions like Lithos, a distributed permissionless mining pool running on-chain, and the potential for side chains with Node 6.0. The hosts also examined the historical "Bear Whale" attack on SigmaUSD from 2021, explaining how this adversarial testing ultimately strengthened the protocol and led to improved stablecoin designs like Dexy and Gluon.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Emission Reduction Impact**: Ergo's block rewards dropped to 21 ERG with six more reduction steps planned to reach 3 ERG by 2026
• **Mining Economics**: Discussion of how reduced emissions affect mining profitability and the role of storage rent in future mining rewards
• **Regulatory Challenges**: NiceHash KYC requirements and the broader implications for cryptocurrency privacy and permissionless access
• **Technical Developments**: Upcoming Node 6.0 features including Lithos (distributed mining pool) and side chain capabilities
• **Bear Whale Saga**: Historical analysis of the 2021 SigmaUSD attack that exploited Oracle update speeds for arbitrage
• **Stablecoin Evolution**: How the Bear Whale attack led to improved designs in Dexy and Gluon protocols
• **Future Applications**: Discussion of Fair Initial Mining Offerings (FIMO) and potential Monero integration via side chains

## Decisions Made

• Plan to invite technical experts like kushti to discuss Node 6.0 and side chain implementations in future episodes
• Commitment to bringing on guests with deeper technical knowledge to correct any misconceptions and provide more detailed explanations
• Interest in exploring stablecoin protocol experts to explain Dexy and Gluon mechanisms in greater detail

## Notable Quotes

> "Every time something like that happens, I just, it reinforces that I've kind of made the right choice to associate myself with Ergo. Just my values align and it's like, no, like just we're trying to enable freedom and have a open permissionless transparent network for anyone to participate in." - **tmr.erg** on regulatory overreach

> "The whole point is to be permissionless. I don't need anybody's permission to join the network. So I think it's like, in some sense, bullshit, right?" - **Marc the Shark** on KYC requirements

> "I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm just a guy and I like to read a lot. I don't understand everything perfectly. So if me and Mark get something wrong, I'd love to learn and you can be a guest and come and drop your knowledge on us." - **tmr.erg** encouraging community participation
