[00:09] **Marc the Shark**: Mark, what's happening, man?

[00:11] **Marc the Shark**: Hey, Tim.

[00:12] **Marc the Shark**: Good, man. Good. Warm and sunny in Florida. How about you?

[00:16] **tmr.erg**: Dude, it's cold over here. It was, I think, in the 20s this morning when I woke up. But you know what is heating up, though?

[00:27] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, the bull run, right?

[00:30] **tmr.erg**: Oh, dude, I gotta say, the other day, I saw that dumb bird just like going up and I was the worst employee. I checked my phone like 30 times, I swear to God. I was like, holy shit, 90,000.

[00:43] **Marc the Shark**: What a great Monday, you know, it's just like, geez, and then I see people on Twitter. It's like, okay, we don't have to post every $1,000. You know, it's starting to get like that. It's exciting. You know, it's just like, oh, man, you know, texting the normie friends like guys, it's happening, you know, the conviction. Yeah, we have it's finally, you know, it's bearing fruit in some sense, right?

[01:03] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, dude, I gotta say, when Bitcoin was down, I told 50 to 100 people, like for sure, at least that many. I even did a presentation in my doctoral program because we had this assignment where it was for an evaluation class, like how to structure formal evaluations. And so my like little side project or like mini project for this class was is Bitcoin a scam? And so I like conducted a formal evaluation. And clearly, it's not a scam. I don't know if it's going to be the reserve currency of the world, but it's not a scam. And so I gave this whole presentation. Everyone was like, didn't it just crash? I'm like, yeah, that's why I told you about it right now. I told all these people, probably 100 people in that class and otherwise, the only person that listened to me was my mom. My mom bought. My mom bought Bitcoin and is now like, yeah.

[02:04] **Marc the Shark**: That's awesome. Yeah, good for her. So how did you convince your mom? I feel like my parents, at least my dad, he's like, you know, I should have bought it or like, you know, but then doesn't get the go ahead, I guess, you know, what was your argument, I guess, right?

[02:21] **tmr.erg**: Okay, so really, I wasn't like convincing my mom, my mom asked me kind of a long time ago, like, Hey, like what's Bitcoin? And I was like, I can't give you a really good answer. Let me like read and learn. And you know, like two months later, I was like, Oh God, Bob, we need to, we gotta like, look at this. So like her and I both kind of like went a little bit in and then that led me to, you know, Cardano and then Ergo.

[02:55] **tmr.erg**: And then you know the crash and everyone was depressed and all this and my mom honestly like forgot about it and then you know when everything was super low. I just like kind of brought it up again I was like hey mom you need to like get back into Coinbase and like you should buy a little bit more now because you're gonna have twice as much buying power and it'll be worth it.

[03:21] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah. It's funny too, like you were saying, right? Some people are like, well, didn't it just crash? They weren't saying that, right? In 2008, 2009, when the housing market crashed, you know, people were buying up a bunch of houses. If you have the liquidity, of course, a lot of people were hurting, but people weren't going to say, oh, are you not going to buy a house? I mean, of course, it's a little bit different from an asset perspective. But I don't know. I think it's interesting. Maybe it's just so new. People are still kind of, I mean, we're so early even too, right? It's just so, people are still just not really sure about it, right?

[03:53] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, man. It's really funny. Like whenever you start saying your honest opinion about this to people, like how early are we? Like you feel kind of crazy. You know, it's like, yeah, no, it could legit be in the millions. If, if Bitcoin hits half of gold, that's like 400k. That's crazy. Half of gold. And why not? Why not?

[04:22] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah. And then with the current administration, or not the current, the next administration kind of coming in, it seems they're suggesting, right? It could be an indicator that's positive for Bitcoin. And then also other people are maybe starting to come around. I don't know if you saw a tweet from Peter Schiff. Peter Schiff's like, I'm starting to come around. Maybe we can fix the social security problem. He's like, if we buy 25% of all of the Bitcoin, that would shoot it up to 20 million. Then we would just hold and coming up with all this stuff and that would be amazing. Obviously good price, but even for social security, like I would love to retire and get social security, you know?

[05:05] **tmr.erg**: I think he was being sarcastic, but the further he went along, it's like, dude, you're making the exact point. He's like, well, then you have to sell your Bitcoin. And I actually posted the meme. Dude, I'm going to actually show this meme real quick. I won't show the meme. It's the one where Neo is talking to Morpheus. And he's like, so you're saying I'm going to be able to sell my bitcoins for millions of dollars? He's like, no, Neo. When you're ready, you won't have to. I sent that to Peter Schiff, probably didn't see it. But whatever.

[05:43] **Marc the Shark**: No, absolutely. I mean, and if what are you saying, you know, right, maybe it will be a reserve currency, and then you won't have to sell it. And you know, there will be all of these financial mechanisms to where it's like, you can leverage your Bitcoin without selling your Bitcoin in some sense. And we're starting to see different vehicles with the stock market. You can buy the ETFs. That's been doing really, really well. Micro strategies. I don't have you paid attention much to micro strategies. That's a crazy volatile index relative to Bitcoin. It's like, it's hotter than Bitcoin. I bought some like, when it first not micro strategies, but when the ETF came out, and I'm up pretty good. And it's just like, it's crazy, like to see.

[06:29] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, dude. I saw when Grayscale, remember when Grayscale was that just like a deep discount? It was like nice little discount, you know, and then...

[06:58] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah. So it's a wild time. So when do you think a hundred K is going to happen? You know, right now, what is it around 90 something 92, 93?

[07:06] **tmr.erg**: I think it said it was at 91 and then I saw it at 89 dude, for all I know, it could be like three o'clock. I don't know. It wouldn't surprise me. It also wouldn't surprise me if it went down and tested 70 K again. Just, you know, that's how it goes. Like why not?

[07:28] **Marc the Shark**: Absolutely. Yeah, I think people are going to probably start taking profits. And I mean, it's just been a super hot week these last like three days. And then now it's, you know, I would imagine maybe some cooling down. But, you know, I'm sure a lot of people are just bullish with this new administration coming in from a crypto perspective. And, you know, Bobby Kennedy has even mentioned like, you know, some things that he wants to do with Bitcoin and you know, paying off the debt with it. And like, so I think there's gonna be a lot of positives relative to, but of course, we're biased because we've been exposed to so.

[08:09] **tmr.erg**: But overall, dude, super exciting. And hopefully it kind of becomes normal. I was starting this business with my wife and was looking to use some of my funds to borrow against them rather than sell to start this business. And none of the Bitcoin anything, nothing related to Bitcoin is eligible in the stock market at least through Schwab or whatever. So all the stuff I have in Bitcoin, I would actually have to sell it that could borrow against it unless I go through like, you know, third party or whatever. So I'm learning more about that kind of see how realistic it is.

[08:58] **Marc the Shark**: That's interesting. Yeah, especially with the stock market, right? Because it takes because it's cool that's in the stock market, but we actually lose a little bit of applicability within the asset because it sort of locks it, you can't move it, we lose control. But of course, there's certain vehicles why you'd want to do that. Like I have my 401k, you know, I don't really need to take it out and do anything with it.

[09:21] **tmr.erg**: So yeah, same. That's what I had it in a sheltered account. And so it's like, you know, doing all this tax free and I can like make these trades without capitalizing, you know, having to pay taxes. So yeah.

[09:34] **Marc the Shark**: So hopefully this bull market kind of carries over to Ergo. I've seen some people, you know, like, oh, are we going to see above all time highs? Some people are starting to say, oh, I don't think so. I'm not really sure. I haven't really given it too much thought, but it's exciting. I think nonetheless, these next six months.

[09:52] **tmr.erg**: So I actually put this in a tweet yesterday. If you look at the price, it looks bad, like per coin, right? But if you look at the market cap, it's not as bad. So market cap, we're one eighth of the way. So we're at a hundred million right now. And all time high was at like 800 million. Right. So, but price is like $19 to $1. Right. So that looks bad, but it's because all that heavy emission in 21, 22, and then now it's like pretty low, the emissions pretty low. So per market cap, like, I think we're okay right now and ready to participate in the bull market. Like, who knows? Are we gonna stop at 20 or like send it to you know, $10 billion market cap one of these days.

[10:48] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, that was a great tweet that you had because you were saying something up to the effect, right? Basically, the lower it stays or the longer it stays in that sort of level, the more sort of springboard to sort of shoot up, right? And I could probably see that too, you know, because I think we've seen that, like, if you look at Bitcoin, Bitcoin was trading in those trenches for such a very long time like you're saying right very similar Ergo the emissions were extremely high people were spending 10,000 bitcoin on a pizza you know like very similarly here you know with Ergo you know people are spending hundreds of ERG right for for certain things and so I don't know I feel like it could probably it just needs time and it's just inevitable right and so we'll see what happens absolutely but I think we've got a lot of good things confluencing kind of together from an ecosystems perspective to a community perspective the chain itself.

[11:55] **tmr.erg**: Oh, yeah So we'll see what else is going on. We've got ErgoHack. What do you know about ErgoHack? That's just finished up and judging is about to start. Is that right?

[12:07] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, yeah, I think Glasgow said in one of the chats it started. I think it was either yesterday or today. Yeah, ErgoHack 9 so that's pretty sweet. What was it? It's about UI and mining so great theme. I think. You know, Ergo is poised to be, you know, one of the best proof of work chains out there. So of course, highlighting that to outsiders, I think is extremely important. And then of course, relative from the user perspective, you know, harnessing the UIs and making our UIs a lot better. Because I think for some, a lot of people don't really like, I guess, UIs in Ergo. But I feel like, to me, that doesn't really mean much. And so like UI is user interface. So like, what about the UI? Does it make sense? And you brought it, I think, I think we might've talked about this on the last podcast where it's like, well, what do we mean when we say this is a bad UI? And I think you were kind of saying like, basically know your assumptions. What exactly does it do? What it doesn't do FAQs, things like that. So it would be cool, kind of interesting if like there was a standardization relative to UI. So like someone that's coming new into the ecosystem could say, Hey, I want to make something we could point them to Hey, this is sort of the standard. And then we can kind of continue to build up.

[13:26] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, for sure, man. I think there's been a lot of good things to come out of these ErgoHacks. And even if it's not necessarily a project that comes out, it's like, just a culture that kind of develops over time or people just kind of want to help others learn. And a lot of this stuff is open source. So like things, you know, even if something doesn't work out or a project dies, you know, like, I think ErgoPad just shut down, right? But like, it's okay. All that stuff is still there to get reused. All the vesting contracts, that's super useful. And somebody is going to take that and use it. And same for all these ErgoHack projects. Though, of course, I hope they succeed. I saw some cool ones on the list of the present ErgoHack. One of them I was super excited about was Minotaur. We've kind of been waiting for a good multi-sig. I saw the video. Looks pretty simple. You know, that's exactly what we want.

[14:34] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah. Well, so how does it work then? I guess is it basically because for multi-sig need multiple people, right? Maybe four out of seven keys. So how does it handle that? I guess.

[14:44] **tmr.erg**: So the video that I watched, it was really just showing like several wallets being open at the same time. And when one like submitted the transaction, it appeared on all the wallets like you need to sign this transaction. And then so all the people would be able to fulfill that obligation and then the transaction would go through. And I think that's like super necessary as I don't know, let's say somebody got a million bucks in ERG in a few years. You really need to think about your security and ensuring that you're not going to lose that. Like myself, I use the steel plates. That's what secures my funds, but I also give incomplete plates to different people. And so they know, like, if something happened to me, they could talk to these other people and figure out how to get my funds, right? So they could like put their thing together. But that, you know, that's a multi-sig. But it's a little tricky. And so this is just like taking all the work out of that and all the sketchiness where I could actually just like set it up and do it legit, like thank goodness. Thank you, Minotaur.

[16:05] **Marc the Shark**: Right. And I think too from like, like you're saying, like, you know, I see some people who have like hundreds of thousands of ERG in a given wallet. That makes me nervous. You know, I have multiple wallets set up. But if you have a multi-sig and you hold all the keys, you know that that's kind of a reinforcement of like no one's going to hack you because they have to hack you maybe four out of seven keys for example or whatever the case so I think that's definitely an extra security benefit security blanket makes you sleep a little bit better at night with that's you know if you're especially if you have if it's a hot wallet right because I mean that's eventually going to happen say you take profits and you do have that much it's like that's going to be nerve wracking. You know what I mean? And putting that all in a hot wallet and you know, maybe some guy has your keys, just doesn't know it waiting to see, Oh, 100,000 just popped in there. They run their script or bots just waiting. I mean, hopefully not right. But I'm just, you know, thinking of the worst sort of outcome that would be devastating. You know what I mean?

[17:06] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, man. I mean, keylogger is probably the easiest thing to happen to somebody, you know, just they get your password, remote access, gone.

[17:19] **Marc the Shark**: Right. It's like, dude. Yeah. And then that's what's, in some sense, cool about I guess it's more of more institution type stuff because it adds like that security blanket, I guess. But I don't know how from an insurance perspective, like if they were to lose your keys. But I think at the end of the day, you got to take accountability. If you're going to put all that money into that sort of stuff, you need to make sure you know what you're doing. You know, like, for example, there was somebody in Rosen that got scammed, like, I don't know, 16,000 because he gave his keys. But it's just like, dude, you have 16,000 or like, how do you not know that you don't do that? Like it's just money growing trees for you. Like how do you know what I mean? It's just like, it's a weird concept that people sort of, I guess, ape into something and then don't do any like due diligence. So certainly a wild west, but of course a certain level of accountability needs to be in place.

[18:16] **tmr.erg**: So let's see what else we got. We got a cool one. 3D Ergo. Bro, you wanna talk about 3D Ergo?

[18:27] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, so it looks like it's a, what would you call this? An explorer for, I guess not an explorer, right? More of like a visual explorer, in any case. Yeah, like a visual explorer. Looks at a specific block and then you can zoom in on the given TXs and see where they're going and coming from. I got it pulled up, let me see if I can share this. And like this would be really neat, for example, if like you had one input and like 10,000 outputs, I would love to see something like that, you know, or like where people are trying to stress test sort of the network. That would be kind of really cool to see.

[19:09] **tmr.erg**: Mark, while I'm doing this, do you wanna look for the block that had the MiGoreng drop?

[19:16] **tmr.erg**: Okay, yeah, let me see. That one had, let's see if we can, okay. So I'll talk about this. So here's, these are the transactions that are in the current block. Oh man, I did this like 15 minutes ago. Oh, there we go. All right. Now we're cooking. So you click on it and you can really see what each block is doing and what it's connected to. And there's like a starting point and an ending point and you can, oh yeah. Look at this. Oh wow. Yeah. I just think this is so dang cool. Like, I think you would have to be doing this like kind of purposefully to like really, oh, look at that, there's a SigmaUSD.

[20:02] **Marc the Shark**: I think maybe a next step with this could be from an analysis perspective to where it's like maybe you put in your wallet and then you can see all the different wallets from a networking perspective that they're connected to. So then you could, if you were like, Hey, this guy has like, you know, 10 million ERG, but he's doing some weird sketchy stuff. You know, you can maybe analyze all his wallets that he's interacting with, and then kind of figure out maybe what they're doing. Maybe it's like the Silk Road and you can kind of follow that a little bit more closely.

[20:38] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, that's a cool idea, man. I was also thinking about it like you could see if your privacy was broken, you know, like, like, oh, did I make a mistake in my wallet? Am I screwed? Do I have to like mix all this again or whatever? You could just put your wallets in here and see if they connect. And if they don't, you're good.

[21:09] **Marc the Shark**: Right. Yeah, absolutely. See if it's traceable back to you. I mean, yeah, that would be really neat. I mean, especially from a mining pool perspective where we're sending out, you know, transactions every day, it would be cool to see like, based off our sort of node, just the branches and like how that sort of like ripples, so to speak, throughout the ecosystem, people switching stuff, moving it around. I couldn't find the block. I found some article on Reddit, but they didn't give me that.

[21:40] **tmr.erg**: Well, we'll come back to it. We'll throw that up next episode. It sounds good. Probably crash there. They can pull it up 20,000 times. And so what else we got? You have a project in this ErgoHack. Tell me. I actually know very little. I saw your tweets, something about NFTs and swapping.

[22:11] **Marc the Shark**: So no swapping. That was my last one. So I'm calling it the Miner Rights Protocol. So MRP for short. And so essentially the idea is to, it's similar to kind of mining in and of itself nowadays. And so in order to mine at a given mine shaft, you have to buy the rights if you don't own the land. You have to buy the rights to be able to mine that. And so the idea here is that miners would then buy this token, buy the rights to this token, and then the protocol owner of this token can then set up various mechanisms for emission. And so call it MRP as the token, for right now and say we have 10 million for a given Ergo block maybe there's a hundred thousand or I guess a thousand are released and then we can then tie the emission to the miner that found the block on Ergo so then we can essentially bootstrap the Ergo protocol on top of a token and then we can then emit this token through the mining system instead of an IPO or ICO initial coin offering. And then, so then this way, whoever has the rights will then, in essence, sort of restrict sort of, I guess, the difficulty in some sense, right? Because if only five people have it, it's going to be pretty difficult to mine. But if the entire ecosystem has it, then pretty easy. But again, allow for the miners to control rather than so so then yeah another idea I guess kind of with that is you could mint NFTs with this and let the miners mint the NFTs sort of programmatically and so then the given block that a miner found could be then used within the algorithm that generates the NFT to then make that NFT so it's driven by the sort of parameters and so in essence it helps with rug pulling in some sense because you can't the only way to rug pull this is no miners are running it and so so it's based off the miners and so I can make one but they could be like, oh, well, this is stupid. I'm not going to run this. Oh, but I like this other one. Or the mining pool could do it. And then the mining pool could facilitate it. So it's basically putting the token emissions back into, specifically for tokens, into the miners' hands. And then they can sell them to whoever they want. But also, we can gamify this, kind of developing an idea within the game to where miners finding blocks is gamified and then if they find a block something happens like so for example maybe they have some probability of finding some given reward and then if they get it then they get that token. I don't have anything. I have some of this coded out, but kind of in short, we set up the emission contract and miners will then verify that they found a given block. They will then run off chain bots to then collect this UTXO because then is now spendable for that miner. And then the person who's running the bot will then get a little bit for themselves. Again, based off the protocol, you could maybe not incentivize people to run bots. But why would you do that? It would make sense. Like, for example, if you're not a miner, you maybe want to run a bot. So then you could get a little bit of rewards for giving a miner that given token because they found the block and then you can kind of facilitate it from there but of course only mine it if you have that given rights token and then the rights token can help with I suppose the price because say you have I don't know 10,000 rights tokens and only one miner and one rights token is I don't know one ERG and doesn't make sense to have more than one, you know, then you're kind of, and that's 10,000 ERG. So then that could be sort of the market cap for this given token initially. And so, I don't know, so kind of playing around with some of like the specifics, right. But from a conceptual perspective, that's what it is.

[26:23] **tmr.erg**: Dude, that's so sick. So I think maybe previously there was something about like, a specific mining pool. If you are in this specific mining pool, then they can distribute tokens to that pool. But yours is not a pool, but it's whoever's holding that token.

[26:40] **Marc the Shark**: Right. Yeah, exactly. And then it has to be a miner. Yeah. So just somebody, anybody mining who has that token would then be eligible to earn your tokens if they find a block.

[26:56] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And then again, we can like build upon this. So where it's like, say, you're not a miner, but you want to like invest in my mining company, right? Because so then you could buy mining rights tokens for me and then stake your mining tokens on my rigs or something like that and then you get a cut of my rewards when I find a block because you can like maybe within the protocol the more mining rights tokens you have that's as a multiplier for how much is emitted you know and so but then you can also, that's true. Maybe in six months, the general emissions are cut in half. You know, so you could have halving, you can have a logarithmic curve, you can have a linear, you can do whatever you want. The idea is really kind of sort of to kind of create this putty and then we can stretch it kind of however we want it to fit the sort of space that we need. So it should be pretty flexible in terms of what people like. So I'm hoping to make an entire user interface. So then if you wanted to make this, you could do that. And then people then just put in the proxy contract address in terms of off chain bots, and then they could just be on their way. And then it would just kind of work together.

[28:05] **tmr.erg**: Sounds like you need somebody to create a new project and wants to distribute some tokens.

[28:15] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, right. Otherwise, I think I might try to release the first one. But yeah, it's going to be fun. And then if I create it, right, I don't get any money from this. Right. I mean, unless I put it in the protocol fees, but people will be able to see that. So it's not like people can just create something and it's not obvious a rug pull. You know what I mean? So it's just a different way to make miners more income potentially. Right. Cause it's up to them if they want to buy the tokens or not.

[28:47] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, I can imagine a lot of different uses like one way or the other, you know, yeah, but you have a good point. You know, not everything needs a token. That was something I read very early on in Ergo and kushti was maybe criticizing Chainlink a little bit, like, why do you have a token? Like, you're an Oracle, you could use the ETH of like, what's this for? You're clearly just trying to get some money here.

[29:16] **Marc the Shark**: Totally, totally. So I think for this, kind of on that sort of, like, yeah, I guess, in some sense, yeah, definitely don't need to, but I think from an educational perspective, it's kind of cool to see because then people are running off chain bots, you know, and maybe people aren't privy to what that is. And so, you know, that's kind of a cool mechanism to kind of explore. So maybe some educational, but even what's really cool in my mind is just bootstrapping the Ergo protocol on top of this. So then, you know, we're essentially kind of, it's not a side chain. It's not like a layer two, I guess, but it's, I don't know. It's like a, it's like an in-between layer on Ergo, I guess. And we're just essentially using those tools and kind of creating our, and now you have wrote this, I'm glad you thought of it. So it's like a synthetic GPU mining. So the miner rights are essentially synthetic GPUs. You buy those synthetic GPUs to be able to have the access to mine this given token, just like how Ergo is. Right? I'm buying a GPU and that gives me the right to mine Ergo. So pretty interesting. I think at least dude.

[30:22] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, that's a sick idea. Congrats. Thanks. Yeah, we'll see what I'm curious what other people think. So I'm super pumped to get this developed and out the door.

[30:37] **tmr.erg**: Right on, man. All right. Well, what else? What else do you want to talk about today? We've been going for about 30 something

[30:43] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, I mean, we can definitely, I'd say so we talked a little bit about maybe some standardization with UI, right? And maybe why that's important. So I think kind of pivoting back to that, we have the Ergo improvement proposals. And that's, to me, is kind of like the shows the topology of the chain and sort of how it works, why we do certain things. So why do we have proxy contracts or why do we do certain things like with Babel fees or. So if you haven't looked up at the EIP, I'd say definitely kind of take a look. You know, there's there's artwork standards. There's I think the most recent. I know that's not true, but like there's a collection standard for NFTs, you know, so maybe you've heard that. So I know Cyberverse has its own collection. For the NFTs and maybe you thought well, why is that a thing? Well, we can read on the Ergo improvement proposal of why that was a thing There's probably a problem that was looking to solve right and this is the solution for that. So I think it's kind of like for lack of a better word it's like the Bill of Rights of the chain in some sense of like, you know of why we're doing certain things a certain way I guess

[31:54] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, okay. That's super cool. So maybe let me say it back. So an EIP is like an agreement among the users of Ergo that this is the way we're going to do something specifically and it's like limited to whatever the EIP says or is like the topic that they're talking about. And the purpose of that is to just make sure that we're a little bit more organized and can like kind of agree upon like a procedure for this specific set of actions like NFTs or whatever. We had talked previously about the emission reduction. That was one EIP that got proposed and passed. Let's say I have an idea for an EIP. How do I propose an EIP and how does that get approved?

[32:45] **Marc the Shark**: That's a great question. I know there's a repo and I'm looking at it right now and I think you essentially just put in a pull request because there's a bunch of different EIPs that are I guess being voted on and I'm not sure who votes on them. Maybe the miners vote on them. I'm not really too sure. Maybe we can get kushti on here and he can help us out with that. I think he'd be a great person to talk to on that. Yeah, because we have, there's like 26 pull requests right now in the EIP. And I know one of them, right, it was written by qx() with like ephemeral tokens. And so I think the general generality of the idea is just kind of put a good use case, kind of explain the problem, right, and then why we kind of need this sort of standardization. So like, kind of going to an example here is, would be EIP-5, so it's a contract template. And so you might be able to see in some of the ErgoHack submissions, a lot of people are using this template to facilitate the explanation of their given contracts. And so, let's see, does it say anything specific? So, I mean, it just kind of tells you, right, just the given formats or maybe this is the right one. In any case, definitely worth checking out and then even comparing to like Bitcoin's, proposals and improvement proposals and other things, and things like that. Because again, I think it's important to kind of take a look at and for a while I didn't really, wasn't really aware of this. And so, I mean, EIP-27 is the soft fork, emission retargeting soft fork. So, it's definitely, you know, something to be with the ecosystem, right? So.

[34:46] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, yeah. I wonder, like, if some things are voted on and others aren't, or does everything need to be voted on by miners? It's like, I kind of wonder, you know, what's the scope of an EIP, you know, like is an EIP always, cause it sounds like the contract template. Like that's not something that's in the core protocol, you know, that's like something people are just kind of agreeing on using. So like, does that get voted on by miners? Or is that just like, did we just talk about it in GitHub? And everyone's like, cool, right?

[35:22] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, you know, what's the consensus mechanism, I guess, for accepting the social layer? Yeah, I'm not too sure, to be honest. So I would imagine for forking, miners need to approve that. There's probably a vote. But if there's no fork, so EIP-6, Informal Smart Contract Protocol Specification Format, that is the one I was actually referring to. But that didn't need a fork. maybe some of the core devs, maybe from EF, that sort of thing, we're like, hey, this is a really great way to facilitate that and let's accept that and then becomes an improvement proposal. So I think the heart of it is, like you were saying, it's not part of the core protocol, but it's an improvement. And if it makes sense to, I guess, the core devs, and I think, it's always subject to change, you know what I mean?

[36:18] **tmr.erg**: Maybe that's it right there. If it requires a soft fork, it requires a vote by miners. Right. I bet that's it. Oh, look at us. We're learning.

[36:31] **Marc the Shark**: But yeah, definitely it's interesting. And so when I was writing some contracts, I kind of stumbled upon this and I was like, oh, I need to kind of pay attention to this. And so if you're a new dev to the ecosystem, I mean, a great place to start to understand Ergo and the topology is for sure the EIPs.

[36:51] **tmr.erg**: Yeah. And I think I think even not devs should should kind of understand you know just like know your assumptions you should know a little bit you don't have to be like super technical I don't think I'm super technical but I'm like aware of these decisions that are being made that are going to affect my bag, you know, it's like, yeah, you got to know, you got to know. And if you don't know, it's your fault, because it's all public.

[37:19] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah. And then from a, you know, bag perspective, like, maybe why should I invest in this? What are they proposing in the future to be an EIP? Maybe they have something that's like, very critical, and that could be really interesting. So like, I know, right now, sub-blocks are kind of on the hot topic right now. So I would imagine there's probably an EIP kind of coming up or in the works potentially for that. There's one on storage rent, right? So it's very interesting. Yeah, definitely worth taking a look at and kind of diving into just to kind of be more of a bull, I suppose, for Ergo, because there's a lot of stuff happening. And this is a great way to see that, right?

[38:02] **tmr.erg**: So maybe I'll share this and we can talk about it and then wrap up. I made this yesterday, and your talk about EIPs and all this stuff is in the GitHub, and it's all right there. It's here for everyone to see. And when I go through that exercise of really understanding Ergo, I could just kind of see where all these things are just falling short. It's like, if anyone who's in these anyone outside of Ergo is listening to this and you're involved in these projects like like take take a second and look at what we got man like it's just so clear how none of these things are going to stand up like none of these things stand up dude I actually saw a tweet from somebody from Luna Classic yesterday and I just I couldn't I couldn't believe it like what are you doing what what are you doing

[39:00] **Marc the Shark**: Right. What did they, what did they say?

[39:02] **tmr.erg**: Oh, just like, I don't know, they were just like, hyping it up. Like, are you serious? Like, are you serious?

[39:10] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, I'd say, you know, it's hard to, you know, be, I guess, unbiased, especially if you got so much money. And maybe that's the case for them. And I think it's important to I mean, and that's a great what you did there. It's a great you know, exercise in validating your own sort of ideas on Ergo, right? Because it's like, well, is it the best or, you know, is this a good idea? And, you know, we're able to kind of run through those specific other chains, kind of see where they fell, you know, and it seems, right, Ergo is kind of, you know, kind of this top dog in the sense of its protocol and, you know, everything it kind of stands for compared to these other chains where they've in a sense fell short, right? Because I'm sure they had a, yeah, go ahead, sorry.

[39:55] **tmr.erg**: No, to your point, I think when you kind of get married to a bag, you get in some blind spots. And I was trying to be a little bit funny with some of these. But also, I don't know, maybe illuminate some of these things like Litecoin. You're all in on Litecoin. That's it. That's what you're doing. And maybe a few people would kind of just reflect and be like, oh, it's been 15 years and maybe something is a little bit better.

[40:29] **Marc the Shark**: Right, absolutely. Yeah, especially from a tech perspective, because it's just like, you know, Litecoin is just a copy of Bitcoin. There's not really anything inherently special. So I guess with that, you know, when do you think Ergo is going to get a fork? And we'll start to see Ergo get forked in the sense of like light Ergo or like, you know, Doge Ergo, in a sense of like, it's a copy of it, just like how these other coins have, you know, do you think that'll happen?

[41:03] **tmr.erg**: I'm sure Ergo will get forked. I mean, I am surprised it didn't happen with the mining reduction. Very easily could have happened. Ethereum forked when they started messing with their mining and got rid of their mining. Totally. Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me if there was some update that a substantial amount of people didn't agree to. But that's why we do soft forks. Ergo kind of is committed to not having hard forks because we recognize the value of a coherent social layer where we're kind of all on the same team. And if the majority of us don't agree to something, well, then we're not going to do it. Totally. And I just appreciate that. And honestly, I wish that our actual government had some sort of function where, like, if somebody makes a proposal and 90% of the population votes for it, that should be a law. Right. That should just be a law. And I don't know. Maybe that will happen sometime, but probably not.

[42:17] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, I mean, I think it's a good indicator in some sense of like, you know, the ethos of the community that we haven't had a hard fork for like Ergo Classic or some shit like that, because it's like, you know, we are true to our values. And so because of that, we're still on the same lane as we've always been versus like something like Bitcoin. OK, we're going to fork to Doge just to make a joke. Oh, we're going to fork to Litecoin because, you know, we'll be the silver or whatever their original, you know, whatever it is, you know, kind of going after money. Right. They're doing it for the wrong reasons. Bitcoin Cash, same thing. You know, going after the money. Whereas, you know, that's not necessarily the case here. So people are kind of in it for the core values, for the everyday people, kind of that sort of thing. And that's kind of cool to see. Hopefully, after this, we don't see the hard forks take place. I think it's a good sign from a community perspective that that hasn't taken place yet.

[43:19] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, 100%, man. Totally agree. I think this might be a good place for us to wrap it up. So thanks, Mark.

[43:28] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, thanks, Tim. Have a great time everybody. See ya.
