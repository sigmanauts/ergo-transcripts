# Ergo Community Chat - December 19, 2025

## Executive Summary
This community call covered Ergo Foundation's transition to community ownership, including discussions about market making costs, explorer infrastructure, and recent development updates. The conversation also featured demos of new integrations like SigmaUSD on MewDEX and Cornell University's blockchain-based campus token system.

## Key Topics Discussed
• **EF transition to community ownership** - Discussion of ongoing costs like market making ($12K/quarter) and explorer infrastructure (~$720/month)
• **SigmaUSD integration on MewDEX** - HQ demonstrated native pools for SigUSD and DexyGold with freemint/arbmint functionality
• **VoltPay.Store integration** - HQ showcased crypto-to-gift card service with multiple swap providers including Trocador
• **Cornell University blockchain implementation** - Qx demoed campus "brick" token system for recycling, plotting, and student services
• **Developer updates** - Progress on Game of Prompts, Lithos 2.2.0, Degen's World ErgoTrace tool, and various wallet improvements
• **Ergo Santa campaign** - Community airdrop campaign being organized with DEX trading incentives

## Notable Announcements or Decisions
• Market making transitioning from professional service to community-run bots with existing MM providing guidance
• Explorer infrastructure moving to P2P DAO nodes plus two main explorers (one with Qx, one shipping to Jamai)
• SigmaUSD now available for swapping and liquidity provision on MewDEX
• Lithos release 2.2.0 with multi-threaded sync and improved APIs
• Ergo Santa campaign collecting token donations for DEX trading rewards

## Technical Concepts Explained
• **Market making challenges** - Why Ergo uses non-profit market makers vs. exploitative spread-capturing models used by other chains
• **Explorer infrastructure costs** - Large RAM requirements (120GB) for complex queries vs. lighter P2P nodes
• **Zero-conf transactions** - Chain transactions allowing immediate spending of unconfirmed transactions in Nautilus wallet
• **SigmaUSD mechanics** - Freemint and arbmint functions for price balancing between LP pools and bank contracts

## Action Items or Follow-ups Mentioned
• HQ to create PR adding VoltPay.Store integration to Nautilus wallet buy options
• Community members testing market making bots over next 1-2 months with professional MM guidance
• Explorer infrastructure transition to distributed P2P model with fallback to main explorers
• Ergo Santa campaign seeking more token contributions for community airdrops
