[00:11] **Grayman**: Welcome Ergonauts to the July 31st 2025 episode of the AMA with a lot of Ergonaut luminaries on board to educate you and answer your questions.

[00:28] **Grayman**: If you are on YouTube, welcome. If you want to ask questions, we will try to have a look at the comments there. But if you want to participate directly, please join us on Zoom. Links are in the Discord or the Telegram channels.

[00:45] **Grayman**: And without further ado, here is Mr. QX.

[00:52] **qx()**: Are you going to pass it off to me? Thanks for the intro. Fantastic. Well, I'm on the road today, but still joining you. If I crash, you'll witness firsthand the first blockchain death. So that could be something that would elevate Ergo to new heights. But otherwise, yeah, please join up.

[01:12] **qx()**: The links are in the Telegram chat or the recent Twitter post from Ergo platform. kushti put up some topics for today. One of them is Sigma Lock, so I can comment on that real quickly before I pass it off to kushti for the two topics that he popped up and maybe wants to talk about.

[01:37] **qx()**: We have not had any progress this week with it. Last I talked to 4i's consulting, they are going to push it to their reversal for sigma testing. The domain is already, it's going to be sigma lock at sigmanauts.com. That's a lot of sig, I guess, right? But hey, you can't have too much Sigmanauts.

[02:01] **qx()**: And we're going to test it out in our group first, just a little bit, and then we'll release it to the wild once it gets on to our permanent server. So looking forward to that.

[02:12] **qx()**: For those of you that don't know, we used, we did a DAO vote in the Sigmanauts two weeks ago to buy the kushti two-hour token. And what that does is kushti put up his own time on MewPhysicals, MewFinance. Then you can buy a token which grants you two hours of whatever you want to do with kushti. I don't think you got specifics, so if there's any time left over, I might get creative. kushti, you better watch out.

[02:42] **qx()**: So we did a DAO vote and we spent 70,000 Mew, which is around 500 bucks at the time. And we purchased two hours of kushti time and the SigmaLock contracts are going to be officially reviewed by kushti himself. So that should bring us a little bit of confidence into the actual platform that we're trying to put forward here for everybody to use. So we're really excited about that.

[03:09] **qx()**: And then on top of that, since kushti has 70,000 Mew now, if you guys didn't miss the chat yesterday, he offered like bounties for people willing to do videos on MewFinance and MewPhysicals and the things that MewPhysicals, the swap app that you just made, all that kind of stuff. So if you're looking to make some cash and you do videos then reach out to kushti and see his post there to see what you can earn from doing that. But yeah excited about the release of Sigma Lock and looking forward to it.

[03:50] **Kushti**: Yeah, so I've announced three prizes for 20K Mew for creating tutorials on how to use some new services, any of them because I think like everything is not so well covered with guides and tutorials at the moment right. So yeah it could be text or video so yeah please share in the MewFinance group and Ergo platform group and yeah I'll check them a bit later.

[04:34] **Kushti**: So yeah, well, I think we need for more tutorials and yeah for more circulation, right? So yeah, I mean somehow you make those 70k Mew. Then, yeah, I've got them, right. I'm paying for tutorials with them and hopefully, yeah, the guys received those Mew will do something further.

[05:02] **Kushti**: So, yeah, well, I think we need to do as much as possible positive circulation of different monetary value of ERGs and tokens in the ecosystem. Yeah, so there could be a lot of inventive ways. And after all, as well, the ecosystem is not that big now. So it's basically the same money after all, right? Going circles, making multiple hops, working efficiently, right? So yeah, well the more circulation, the more velocity, the more services being created and sold along with condenser and so on, the better for the ecosystem.

[06:05] **qx()**: And kushti, something I use at work for tutorial videos when I make them quite a bit is I'll record the video, usually one take as best I can so I don't have to edit. And I'll push that video through Whisper AI so I get a beautiful transcript. And then I'll take a few screenshots of different screens of the video in order, and I will feed the screenshots and the subtitle file into AI again and ask it to make me written tutorial on the spoken tutorial and it does an amazing job. So if you're okay with just hitting that record button and recording a tutorial, you feed it through AI the rest of the way and it makes a nice set of written tutorials for you as well.

[06:55] **Kushti**: Right, and yeah, well, we need for some experience, right, with Mew and other services. So, Jimmy, maybe you can write about your experience of selling Canon or Mew. And QX, you sold some Mac, Mac what? Mac Pros?

[07:17] **qx()**: Yeah, yeah. We sold some Mac Pros. We sold a Macbook. We're going to sell some of those little Intel machines as well. So we're going to keep at it for sure. Yep.

[07:30] **qx()**: It's funny too, because the other day, I think, I don't know if it's on Cardano or whatnot, but I was reading a post, and I think HQ actually commented on it, so maybe HQ can speak more if that was him. People were like, oh, you know, there's an issue with the blockchain. You know, everything's digital. We need a physical, you know, way to sell and trade goods and that kind of thing. So it's definitely starting to have an awakening of people thinking, hey, why can't we use these tools for this? And I mean, of course, like everything else, Ergo has it long before everybody even thinks about it. Right.

[08:13] **Kushti**: Also, we now have a lot of conversations in the LETS group, so welcome. So, yeah, we now have more people contributing and brainstorming what to do because it's, well, as I described a few times, quite generic, right, to create, well, monetary systems of quite different kind.

[08:41] **Kushti**: So yeah well currently hopefully well we will come to some design of application rights to try and yeah it would be good to make some Ergo-based application for trading rights, not necessarily using SigmaUSD or ERG even, just maybe like IOUs created on the fly, but yeah with blockchain guarantees.

[09:14] **Kushti**: blockchain reserve sometimes and yeah well we can think about some demos like do some I don't know hopefully markets around the Ergo meetup or visit some event like such a market and yeah well trade with such location there. So yeah or something like that, so please join LETS.

[09:47] **qx()**: Mark, how's the EF doing? Ergo hack's over? You guys announced the winners and everything?

[09:58] **glasgowm**: Yeah, yeah, it's all done, all wrapped up now and just on to the next thing. So there's been a lot of trying to work out the budget, trying to stretch it as far as possible past the missions. And just keep it going, keep the development and infrastructure going as long as you can.

[10:15] **glasgowm**: And yeah, apart from that, we've kind of fallen back on the editorial the past few months because our editor left due to personal reasons. So the past month, I've just been trying to blast out as many articles as I can. And try to spread them around different chats. So like the Lithos and ChainCash and stuff, that's really good to kind of pull people in if you get into those spaces and can explain it.

[10:41] **glasgowm**: So yeah, we should be trying to push that kind of stuff out more, try to build up our editorial more and kind of catch up on that backlog in the past few weeks.

[10:52] **qx()**: Have you tested out the Banxa integration into the Nautilus wallet yet?

[10:58] **glasgowm**: I have not and I've just seen a screenshot, but I can't test anyway because the UK has got these new crazy laws that you need to be FCA approved or send every tweet and blog post to a company you pay like five grand a month to approve everything. So it's just this massive barrier. It makes us pretty much the most restrictive place in the world apart from sanctioned countries to provide fiat ramps. But it's a big uproar. Hopefully there'll be some, enough push to kind of get it softened a bit. It came to effect late last year. But yeah, it's a bit of a pain that one.

[11:38] **qx()**: Wow. Do you know if it's just, I didn't look, but is the Banxa button or Buy ERG button, does that just take you to the Banxa page or do you do it inside the Nautilus wallet?

[11:51] **glasgowm**: I'm not sure what kind of level is going to integrate it. I'm sure we could do it to the wallet itself. We may just be doing it the first way for quickness at the moment to get out. But yeah, I think ideally we'd want it integrated right in to the UI.

[12:09] **qx()**: What else we got guys?

[12:11] **HQ3rr**: As far as I remember, you need some credentials to integrate Banxa and apps. So you will need to partner with them and you will need to kind of dox yourself. So I'm not sure if Nautilus wants to do that, or maybe EF would just get those credentials for them to just integrate in the wallet.

[12:28] **glasgowm**: Yeah, they'd be getting it through us. They've offered to give us the contract and stuff with them.

[12:39] **HQ3rr**: Well, in that case, if I can use those also, I can even add them to the post chat, so people can directly buy from there. Or even I can add Banxa page at VoltPay page so if there are people who want to KYC and buy with it they can also buy it from there.

[12:57] **glasgowm**: Yeah I'm looking to see if that's something we can do.

[13:02] **qx()**: Speaking of wallets Minotaur was also released 3.0.1 for desktop and Android. I don't think the iOS built this build, right? I think you have to go get yourself where it's not built. But for people who haven't used Minotaur, it's a pretty fantastic wallet. Just to have kind of a personal standalone wallet, right? It works really good on Android. It looks pretty. They've integrated some new changes for Multi-Sig as well in version 3 that make life a little bit easier. So I encourage people to give it a test run. Again, great wallet made by a great team.

[13:53] **qx()**: What else is new, guys? kushti, how are sub-blocks?

[14:01] **Kushti**: Going well, so I think there is need to present some quite accessible writing, right? So, well, I'm starting to work on the white paper. Other than that, adding some API methods and yesterday I realized how to commit merge mined sidechain state well quite efficiently using the current API just and p2p messages so yeah we'll describe it in the developers chat maybe forum tonight so oh yeah it seems it's a quite solved question so working also on specification for merge mined sidechain rights to pass it to our guys then.

[15:03] **Kushti**: It will be in Rust language, so yeah, well, it's for Rust developers. Well, I can contribute also, but yeah, still needs to catch up. We will Rust and a little bit. So, yeah, well, we'll do a call for contributors once it's ready. Yeah, well, assign boundaries and so on. And then, yeah, it's the question, how to fund it, right? I mentioned my sidechains development. We'll discuss it with Ergo Foundation, how much do we have, so we still need to pay for Keystone integration to PGR456.

[16:03] **Kushti**: And yeah, we paid Dusig also quite a lot in recent months for 6.0 in Sigma Rust. But yeah, probably we have some, so I can start with that and then continue. Then yeah, well, for other projects, well, there are some new projects in Rust also, such as Git Circle announced by my friend, so I look for possibilities to assign issues there. Maybe some bounties from him.

[16:45] **Kushti**: and then yeah well ChainCash and so on so yeah well there is need to attract probably a little bit of funding after all but yeah it's still interesting how much so there is need for more developers right i think now it's time to get more ErgoScript infrastructure peer-to-peer developers on board right maybe try to look through rust circles specifically because it seems a lot of open source contributors now around that language specifically

[17:34] **Kushti**: Then, yeah, so, well, more contributors and yeah, well, I think it's a good time to do another round of promotion for ErgoScript, right? To get some more contracts developers and then, yeah, well, good maybe to also share some knowledge, right, how to attract funding for developers in the ecosystem right now. So what options do we have? Using Raffle, Raffle version 2 coming, Mew, what else do we have? Well, different bounty programs, right, and some grant programs. But yeah, well, there is need for more, I guess.

[18:32] **qx()**: kushti, when you talk about the other day in chat, you said something like, you know, you expect at some point to be hundreds of merge mine chains once this gets full rolling. Can you talk about the benefits of another chain merge mining with Ergo on these sidechains?

[18:50] **Kushti**: Yeah, sure. So in the first place, it is a security budget for the chain itself, right? So miners would receive some additional rewards. Like they're receiving additional rewards in Bitcoin, right, with a variety of sidechains, like Rootstock of Namecoin, but it's not quite live Fractal and so on and then yeah in Monero so now they have Tari they will have Dark DeFi and so on so yeah it would be good for miners to get more rewards right it's good for the base chain and then yeah well as we have solutions for trustless transfers so it's unlike Bitcoin, Monero probably as well.

[19:47] **Kushti**: Then, yeah, it also would be good to have more liquidity locked, right? And liquidity pools act as sidechain tokens and products. Yeah, so let's have more liquidity pools, tokens, material. All right, would be good, I believe. rate and yeah it's stability and growth.

[20:25] **Kushti**: So yeah but we need also for more experimentation right so somehow to get folks that's why Rust was chosen in particular right to get people maybe thinking already on some blockchains, new blockchains, blockchain-based peer-to-peer networks, right, so to get to the right available and yeah, easy bootstrapping option and then yeah, easy liquidity option, right, so well.

[21:05] **Kushti**: for new proof-of-work blockchains, not just sidechains specifically. There are not many choices regarding centralized exchanges. big need for decentralized on-ramp, off-ramp options. So if I mentioned my inside chain, you will have trustless swaps with Ergo, right? Then presence of Ergo DEXs and then Rosen also writes about immediate bootstrapping against the biggest chains like Bitcoin.

[21:54] **Kushti**: So Monero is coming to us, hopefully. So then it's kind of a win-win, right? So if you want to do some blockchain experimentation, then you are getting liquidity, hash rate, and yeah, Ergo miners are getting some additional rewards. Well, for liquidity traders and so on to unlock more ERGs in DeFi.

[22:31] **qx()**: They'll be able to pull the merge mined rewards as well as ERG, as well as storage rent. It's like a triple.

[22:45] **Kushti**: Yeah, yeah. So yeah, it's basically the next kind of box to unlock right after Storage rent. So, yeah, so emission, then storage rent, then, yeah, merge mined sidechains and so on. Well, unfortunately, we don't have memes, right? But yeah, maybe we'll have some alpha.

[23:18] **Grayman**: Can I ask you a question about this merge mined sidechain security issue? Is that a two-way street? So, for example, if there's a merge mined with Bitcoin and Ergo, in the long run Bitcoin has sort of a security budget issue coming down the pipeline, maybe four years from now, maybe eight, whatever it is. Are we going to be able to help them, especially if Ergo begins to take off as a mechanism for them to engage in DeFi and whatnot?

[23:54] **Kushti**: Yeah, so merge mined sidechains are helping Bitcoin with security budget issues, right? Yeah, well, currently, merge mined sidechains A rather small ride in comparison with Bitcoin, such as Fractal, Namecoin, Rootstock, Rootstock, probably the biggest one. I'm not sure about Stacks, if it's merge mined or not.

[24:23] **Kushti**: For example, for Litecoin, the biggest provider of security budget is Dogecoin, which is a merge mined sidechain of Litecoin. And yeah, currently, well, when you see script ASICs advertisements, so they're advertising doge mining in the first place, not Litecoin even. So yeah, well, but it's helping Litecoin, right, to prevent attacks and so on, so to grow the hash rate also to get more appreciated in this regard. So yeah, then in the long term, yeah, it would help Bitcoin as well. True.

[25:25] **glasgowm**: And we've got a question from Canon as well. Merge-bind liquidity pools require liquidity. It seems that whales and ERG are more passive with their, but for work coin/value, what are the benefits for whales that provide LP at one or two percent? Probably doesn't cut it. How to target that?

[25:50] **glasgowm**: I'd say probably do bigger LPs, but I think the best way to incentivize them is to kind of get them excited about the prospects of a merged chain and things you can do with it. That's the best motivator if they think it has potential.

[26:17] **glasgowm**: And Ella asked, are the plans to make Ergo quantum proof? As far as I understand it, the cryptographic protocols that would be quantum proof just now are still a bit too exotic. And there's no rush, really. The best option would be once they're closer, it's an active threat. You could just fork to a chain that has those cryptographic protocols that are quantum proof. But I think we're still quite away from that, at least Ergo. I know the old wallets in Bitcoin are exposed because they use a weaker form of crypto.

[27:01] **glasgowm**: eight years ago plus and one was actually moved recently and a whole bunch of bitcoins moved and they left a note on trading saying if this is yours come claim it. So people are speculating that sometimes they break that old cryptography on those wallets but it's less of a risk for Ergo because we don't use that one.

[27:30] **Grayman**: Yeah, I asked about that a couple AMAs ago, and I'm not sure, because she gave an answer, but I'm not sure he was specifically aware of that situation. In the OP_RETURNs for some of those transactions, there were sort of almost legalese notifications about seizure and sort of threatening that whoever owned those wallets needed to take action within, I think it was 90 days, which sort of corresponds to American law about squatter strikes. So I wonder, is it possible that those actually were hacked? And if so, how did that happen? It probably wasn't a quantum computer. So is it possible that there was some sort of a problem with the early Bitcoin wallets of that particular type and the way that their seeds were generated. There was also something along these lines about a year and a half ago with Ethereum wallets where a lot of Ethereum OGs were finding their stuff just yanked and nobody really ever got to the bottom of it. And then the scuttlebutt kind of died down.

[28:45] **Grayman**: Can somebody comment on whether or not there is some mechanism that we don't understand or is it something that we do understand and are aware of and have avoided in Ergo?

[28:58] **glasgowm**: Yeah, it was a few weeks ago, so I've had to refresh myself. But yeah, they used early reused secp256k1 nonces. So people have known they've been a lot weaker for a while. But yeah, it's not actually known how they got to it. It may just be the actual person that's got it trying to do money laundering or something. So it's kind of up in the air. It's a bit of a weird one. Why would they post that? only just moving this to an anonymous place and cashing it out. So yeah, it's a strange one.

[29:37] **glasgowm**: Yeah, so the brute force for now due to poor entropy or nonce reuse, which undermined independent security guarantees. We don't use those in Ergo.

[29:49] **qx()**: I mean, in fairness, Mark, I can see both scenarios, or I can see what you're saying, like I lost my keys in a body sitting kind of thing. They're trying to launder the money. But look at Ergo in that instance with the zero-day storage rent bomb, right? There were several good actors who spent the boxes and reformed them to the same amount, of course. to help out the people that the storage bomb rent bomb affected so i don't think it's out of the realm of possibility that there's good actors in the bitcoin sphere that you know said okay somebody's going to steal this eventually but we'll give them 90 days to try to figure it out and then we'll just take it because it's better us than somebody else perhaps

[30:36] **glasgowm**: Yes, it's definitely a possibility. It's just obviously Bitcoin is not that tight-knit anymore, and it was a lot of money. I think if somebody found a hundred thousand on their own ERG, it's probably a higher chance to take it than somebody finding a couple grand.

[30:52] **qx()**: True, wow.

[30:59] **qx()**: HQ, you built anything last night while you couldn't sleep?

[31:03] **HQ3rr**: Well, maybe I merged chains pulse. So there should be decentralized on-chain messaging between two chains. So it's basically sending message on one chain, sending message on another chain into a smart contract in front and you're just compiling and parsing the messages. So both chains users can interact with each other by just signing the access.

[31:28] **qx()**: Oh, wow. So that's Ergo and Alephium. You might be emerging those two?

[31:34] **HQ3rr**: Yeah, I was planning to add Cardano, but looking at that you need to spend two ADA to send a message. I'm not sure if people would like to do that.

[31:42] **qx()**: Maybe people will send smarter messages if it costs 1.7 ADA. They'll really think about what they're saying. Oh, that's pretty nifty. So cool. So in theory, you could have people stay on their home chains and still participate in a chat across all these chains.

[32:02] **HQ3rr**: And the best part is that you can showcase your product there, and if they like it, they can use VoltPay to just swap Alephium for Ergo or Alephium and participate in both things and the ecosystem. So the plan here is to have at least a working or non-communities which are there to create our own global economy.

[32:31] **qx()**: Very cool, sir. Very cool.

[32:39] **Grayman**: Is there an analogy?

[32:41] **Kushti**: Yeah, you can send a kind of financial messages, right? Basically, but then it sounds like wormhole, right? Basically has similar cross-chain messaging protocols.

[32:58] **HQ3rr**: Technically, here we are not doing any cross-chain stuff, so one person is doing one thing on chain, another person is doing another on chain, and the front end is just passing the messages and showing that on this chain, this person is saying this, this person is saying that, another chain, and you can reply to them by registering their TXID or maybe their UTXO box ID, and then you are just threading the messages and showing them in the front end, like it is a proper conversation happening between two chains and two users.

[33:26] **Kushti**: So, I can find those messages only with the front end.

[33:32] **HQ3rr**: I mean, from another... Yeah, you can find them on their chain too. You can find them on... If they are messages on Alephium, you can find them on Alephium and if they are messages on Ergo, you can find them on Ergo. And if you want me to create a registry which does grab all the messages and register them on Ergo, we can do that also and use that as a ledger. So, many stuff can be done.

[33:56] **qx()**: That would get expensive though, I imagine. Posting to all 10 chains at once, if you had 10 chains involved in this, I imagine.

[34:07] **HQ3rr**: Yeah, we can set a fee on top of sending message and it should cover the minimum UTXO amount. Well, on Alephium it is UTXO and on Ergo it is box and Alephium is 0.002, Alephium on Ergo is 0.0004. So we can maybe set 0.01 fee and each person when they are submitting the message, they're just creating another box and they're paying for it. So yeah, I think that can be done.

[34:34] **qx()**: Right, or you could incentivize, you could put extra fees in the box in Ergo and incentivize a batcher to run to dupe messages over to the other chain and collect that fee essentially.

[34:52] **HQ3rr**: Yeah, the main idea here is to somehow find a way to communicate with other people, with real people, real users outside of Ergo, to bring them to Ergo and showcase them the DeFi they have on Ergo. And if there are people who are building nice DeFi on the other end and they want to promote it, they can promote it also.

[35:13] **qx()**: And you still plan to release at least a simple front-end open source so that people can at least use a simple part of it if they want to on their own machine?

[35:24] **HQ3rr**: The multi-chain version you want, there is the Ergo version is already open source, the Alephium version is already open source, I'm just merging them into one. So whatever message you're sending on a Alephium, it shows on a Alephium one, whatever message you're sending on Ergo one, it's showing on an Ergo one, but this one will just aggregate the messages in one.

[35:46] **qx()**: Gotcha.

[35:47] **Kushti**: All right. So, will more blockchains be supported like Bitcoin?

[35:56] **HQ3rr**: I guess we can integrate more blockchains to this. We just have to find a way to how to parse a message on chain and then read it and show it.

[36:05] **Kushti**: All right. But for Bitcoin, you can just use OP_RETURN, right? I mean, it's a bit limited, like 80 bytes, but probably enough for most of the messages, short messages.

[36:22] **HQ3rr**: My main plan was to just go with the UTXO ones because they are not the most simple ones. But yeah, more chains can be added too, but it depends on how the volume and other options come from, because you have to understand that thing has to be here when you stream. As we were talking about, there has to be funding to build something. It's not that I'm asking for integration charges to the chains, but there has to be incentivization for the developer to develop something so more people can use it. If you build something and it's not getting used, it's just like building for nothing, for me at least.

[37:05] **Grayman**: What do you do if you've got an EVM chain and the transaction doesn't go through, gets rejected?

[37:13] **HQ3rr**: Well, then we don't go to the shitty chains.

[37:35] **HQ3rr**: So there is, there is one theory which I was trying to, to, to check is that technically in Europe, you can buy a gift card in any stores. So where you can go and pay and you can get a gift card and you can just redeem that and you get that BTC in your, in your wallet.

[37:55] **qx()**: They don't check KYC, but can you buy it in cash? That's a question.

[37:58] **HQ3rr**: Yeah, you can buy in cash.

[38:01] **qx()**: What? How?

[38:03] **HQ3rr**: Yeah, they're gift cards like, like Nintendo Switch ones, Amazon ones, you just go there and you just pay with cash.

[38:10] **qx()**: And you're positive you don't have to take that gift card to their portal and then register your name and birthday and that kind of bullshit when you, when you try to extract your Bitcoin.

[38:20] **HQ3rr**: The last time I tested, you can input anything you want there. So yeah.

[38:25] **qx()**: And you can have some bullshit account with, you know, some stealth email address kind of thing. Yep. Oh, well, that'd be interesting. Sorry, go on with your pathway. Go for it. Sorry.

[38:38] **HQ3rr**: So what was I'm trying to do is you can buy BTC by that way, right? And then you can maybe swap that BTC with ERG. So you're technically buying with your fiat money. Another thing you can do is you can buy that card or redeem it into BTC and you can buy a prepaid card on VoltPay and you can add that to Banxa too but I'm not sure how Banxa works because as far I heard you are required to KYC on registration because if you have a prepaid card you can add it to Google Pay and Apple Pay and you can buy with that too so instead of fiat you are paying with the credit card you get with BTC so yeah there can be many routes can be done for this so but I guess I will have to the sacrifice code to test all this.

[39:38] **Grayman**: We had a couple of comments from Canon. One was to point out that the MindHealer Cloud app is active and he provided a link to that. It's mindhealer.cloud, which is a service for paying for sort of I guess therapy and also advice like for example dietary advice using the blockchain specifically Ergo right now I suppose that could be expanded using Rosen or whatever and I think that's interesting especially because right now in the United States we have this new process that the Trump administration is launching to get all of the big tech companies to start keeping track of medical records, which sounds like a complete nightmare to me. But it does introduce an interesting potential alternative to that.

[40:36] **Grayman**: And then he also made a comment about merge mining. He said, merge mine liquidity pools require liquidity. It seems like the world, the whales and ERG are more passive with their, with their coins and what are the benefits for whales to provide liquidity of one or 2%. How do we target the whales? How do we get them to be more active in the community? HQ says we already answered that one.

[41:13] **Grayman**: And then we also had a comment from Jumei saying, I guess this is a question for QX asking about updates on the InfraDAO. When is it happening? How is that going to happen? What's it look like?

[41:23] **HQ3rr**: If you guys give me one minute, because right now, as you mentioned, Jumei, I was donated yesterday .erg and .mew subdomains on FAKU. So me and Jumaia are going to find a way to provide hosting on our group. So if there are any people who want to buy a host, so they can just get in contact with us and we can just set up a hosting service for them. A part of that, if you're interested in buying some .org domains or .me domains, so can be done too.

[42:05] **qx()**: Awesome. Yeah, InfraDAO. So the vote just passed. I think I just saw the transaction into my wallet from Paideia. Lovely Paideia, just a reminder. So with Paideia, I put up a vote that says, hey, Sigmanauts, I would like 50,000 Paideia so that we can form the official InfraDAO on Paideia. I am and I'm the vote and I attached 50,000 from the treasury of Sigmanauts in to send to me after the vote succeeded and the vote succeeded and I saw I think it was last night of the night before Ergo monitor bot popped up and said you have 50,000 Paideia.

[42:48] **qx()**: So that's in my wallet now and as soon as I get a moment this weekend I'm going to form the DAO and invite the initial four or five members to it and distribute the tokens there and then we'll dump the rest of the InfraDAO tokens into Paideia once we have those four or five founding members in the in the what's it called in the DAO so that we can invite other members via vote and then we'll go from there but yes it's it's a lift for me to prep the four or five machines that we need to do i just need to clone them and put them out so that's a bit of a lift but the bigger lift is for the people not using our machines we are going to

[43:34] **qx()**: I'm put the version of explorer Docker that I use. It was based off of easy Docker and easy. I forget what it was called. It was called explorer front end. It's on the Ergo Foundation website. It's a little outdated, but you can modify some of the Docker comps in there to grab the latest versions and tweak some things. So that's been fully done. That's what I use. It literally takes, it's like a zip file that I use and I drop it down. to, what's it called? And that's it. And it's been a couple of things to say.

[44:19] **qx()**: So that's one of the steps that I can do that's a little easier than setting up the machines for people that want to join and use their own machine. So you'll see that on GitHub with some instructions on how to do it. And that will be available, I guess, for now if you need it. But the other thing we're thinking about as well is I offered a Ergo hosting just like HQ did on the InfraDAO, depending on You know, it's not just the InfraDAO is not just going to exist for explorer and node It's also going to exist for Ergo docs for sigma verse Those kind of things as well as long as we have room on the machines You know, we can we can fit that kind of stuff and also some machines might not

[45:03] **qx()**: run, explorer, and be part of the InfraDAO. They might be running things like Ergo nodes if they want to jump off. Think of it like a community IPFS essentially, but actually running web servers for that. Currently, as I said, the plan is volunteer out of the goodness of your own heart. It'd be really nice if we could find some method of helping fund this to help pay for electricity or that kind of thing for people. But for now, to build it is just out of your own heart.

[45:39] **qx()**: I don't know if it was last week or this week, it all blends together. There is an InfraDAO dashboard that I built. That's the spin up. And that has the main explorer nodes. It's got all the P2P nodes so far. It's got most of the websites for Ergo as well. And it has test nets up as well. So that dashboard is in chat somewhere. You guys can find it if you need it. And it does more than just a simple ping. It actually does four stages when it tests the websites. It goes in, tries to load content, tries to execute scripts, and responds based on that. So it's fairly thorough in the checks that it does to see if the site's actually mine or not, other than a ping.

[46:23] **qx()**: So that's kind of the first build for that that I put up. So yeah, come along. It's a big project and it's going to slow burn for a bit as we get it. But it's not something that I'm going to let pass away, that's for sure.

[46:42] **qx()**: All right, guys, I need to, I'm pulling off to the airport right now to pick up my friends. So I am going to, I'm going to sign off, but you guys enjoy the rest of the AMA. Thanks so much for joining everybody.

[46:56] **Grayman**: Thank you, QX. We're actually running up on 10 o'clock, so I don't know if there are any more questions. I don't see any in the chat, but now would be a good time to chime in. If not, let's back to the salt mines for all of us, right?

[47:15] **Grayman**: I'm going to take that as a vote for everyone yearning for the mines.

[47:22] **Kushti**: Let's continue over the Telegram.

[47:24] **Grayman**: All right. Welcome to join the Telegram or the Discord. And there's great chats constantly ongoing there. If you compare the Ergo community to many others in crypto, you will see that we are active and people care and it's not just a few VC fans that are hoping that they'll get some crumbs, it's people actively developing and discussing the future. So welcome everyone.

[48:01] **glasgowm**: Thanks guys, so I'll catch you in just a second.
