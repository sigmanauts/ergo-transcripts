[00:21] **qx()**: There it is.

[00:22] **qx()**: Welcome everybody to the Ergo official AMA, right?

[00:31] **qx()**: So you're only seeing me today because I think it's a sign of the evolution of Ergo, right?

[00:39] **qx()**: So I am here to announce today that AMAs in the future are going, for the time being, moving to full-on community peer-to-peer AMAs, right?

[00:52] **qx()**: So that means that all community are involved, all communities sit at the table, and all community can have a chance to chat with legends like kushti, like Joe, like Dan, all once a week on Thursday mornings.

[01:11] **qx()**: So I think that's good news. And I think that's particularly the path that Ergo should take and is taking, right?

[01:19] **qx()**: We're moving everything off EF servers with the InfraDAO. Why not take AMAs and move them off the official propped up EF channel to a community event, right?

[01:33] **qx()**: That's what we're going to be doing starting next week. You'll start seeing promotions about that at least five days in advance to give you guys a heads up of what it's going to be, when it's going to be.

[01:43] **qx()**: We'll start off similar to how we did before and see how that goes with everybody in the frame of this YouTube channel and broadcasts at Twitter.

[01:54] **qx()**: I'm looking forward to it. It's going to be a lot of fun. It's always tough to gather everybody together, kushti, Joe, myself, Dan, with our schedules, and figure out exactly who's going to be there and when it's going to be there on Thursday.

[02:08] **qx()**: So these chats, I think, are great where a couple of us show up next week, next group, next week, and the community's there.

[02:16] **qx()**: So very community-centric, which is exactly how Ergo should be.

[02:20] **qx()**: Also, that being said, this AMA is going to be very short, mainly to announce that. Also to give you some updates on what we're doing.

[02:30] **qx()**: And I can try to answer any questions that are in the capacity for me to answer.

[02:35] **qx()**: Paul Sargeus asks, when live stream with Mark? And he says, no, the Kraken guy.

[02:42] **qx()**: That will be, I just pinged kushti, actually, and Joe's asleep, so I didn't bother pinging him, but MGPi sent me the chat.

[02:52] **qx()**: And so I sent it to kushti and Joe and ask them if they wanted me to facilitate it for them.

[02:58] **qx()**: So I think that's great. If we can get Mark, it'd be amazing if we can get Kraken Mark in a community AMA, but I understand people might want more of a sophisticated podcast between somebody like kushti Mark and Joe to chat about that kind of stuff.

[03:15] **qx()**: So I understand both of them, but either one would be cool. So yeah, let's try to facilitate that and get that going.

[03:23] **qx()**: That's going to be exciting.

[03:24] **qx()**: All right, let's see what else. Ergo's hashrate's pretty not terrible, right?

[03:30] **qx()**: It's been down to five in the past couple of months and the other day it's up to seven. Again, seven, almost eight, so not doing terrible there.

[03:39] **qx()**: There has not been discussion given Ergo added to Phantom Wallet, Gandalf, that I know of. So don't have an answer for you on that.

[03:48] **qx()**: All right, so let me go over some things, new things, at least on my front that I've done recently. It's been a really busy two and a half, three weeks with the semester starting back up at school.

[03:58] **qx()**: So I've kind of been just working with my head down and popping into Ergo when I can, but that doesn't mean that things have stopped.

[04:05] **qx()**: We just added a new user to a new member to the Ergo InfraDAO, that is the Stroof. He is, I believe he's an Oracle runner as well. He's spun up some hardware and we have load balance into as well. So super, super cool.

[04:22] **qx()**: Anybody has those URLs? They're in chat. They're on the InfraDAO page.

[04:28] **qx()**: You can point your Nautilus wallet or your ErgoMobile wallet or whatever you choose to use to the peer-to-peer nodes.

[04:37] **qx()**: And they are geo load balanced. So that means right now we only have East Coast of the US and Australia. So two very different things, and Singapore as well.

[04:46] **qx()**: So depending on where your location is and whatever is closest, the load balancer will send you to that peer-to-peer node or GraphQL or API or Explorer. So really excited about that. Super cool.

[05:09] **qx()**: No, Bevis, it wasn't false. We're still on the short list per se, right?

[05:16] **qx()**: So if you missed it before, we had discussions and chat with, not Mark, but Mark's replacement, whoever that guy was. I think Joe, kushti, myself, Mark, Blaskauer, and chats with him.

[05:28] **qx()**: And it was tough to pin them down in exactly what was the requirement for being listed on there, right?

[05:37] **qx()**: And so the thing that I spoke about in recent AMAs was that the easiest path that they thought forward for Ergo in the immediate, right, long term would be the native coin on the native chain on Kraken.

[05:53] **qx()**: But in the short term, the idea was that we could get Rosen-ERG from Cardano listed.

[05:59] **qx()**: And so then we saw Joe come up with a proposal for Rosen Bridge to actually airdrop Rosen-ERG to people in Cardano to increase the wallet count.

[06:11] **qx()**: And that's still in Paideia. So it's interesting to hear people interested about in chats here, but not engaging in Paideia.

[06:20] **qx()**: So again, what I say is if you're interested in this kind of thing, you should hop on Paideia and you should join in the discussion for that proposal that would take Rosen raised funds from the GARD's and distribute some of them to wallets to make that goal that, this is named Dave, I can't remember his name, Kraken Dave, make that goal of X amount of wallets in Cardano that would say, okay, there's enough wallets and holders for us to do that.

[06:53] **qx()**: I mean, honestly, we're, Ergo is a different beast, right?

[06:58] **qx()**: We're dealing with these, even the guy we dealt with, even Dave, again, I hope his name's correct, seemed to understand, there was confusion at first of what chain we were on, that kind of thing.

[07:12] **qx()**: So once that was cleared up, there was, oh, hang on, I gotta stop this call from coming in.

[07:19] **qx()**: There was talk about integration, right, and how that works. So it was kind of teaching him to be able to do that.

[07:30] **qx()**: So then when he came up with the requirements, it really felt like to us that it wasn't like a sheet. It's not an Excel sheet that he's looking at or a CMS that he's looking at saying, okay, in order to be listed, we need to hit these marks and these marks.

[07:44] **qx()**: It really felt like he pulled those numbers out of his ass, to be frank.

[07:47] **qx()**: So we're still, the idea is we still try to hit that. It's not going to be a challenge to hit that over in Cardano with Rosen Bridge. And we approach with that and we see what happens.

[07:58] **qx()**: So I encourage you again, if you want to see that happen, if you want to see something like Rosen Bridge listed on Kraken, then please go to Paideia, go check out I think it's proposal three or four that is up on the GARD's DAO for Rosen Bridge, but it's obvious in the title what it is or in the body of what that proposal is.

[08:20] **qx()**: It makes some comments on it and then encourage people to vote on it, guys. We're a community, right? Nothing happens. We can't wait for mommy and daddy to push us along, right?

[08:30] **qx()**: It's up to us to take that and embrace that. Because if we can't bootstrap ourselves as a community, then what's the point, right?

[08:40] **qx()**: Augustine says, can you please explain what this new DAO is you're mentioning?

[08:44] **qx()**: Yeah, so the DAO is the InfraDAO, and our goal is essentially to remove reliance on centralized EF servers, right?

[08:55] **qx()**: Ergo is a peer-to-peer protocol, so why should we need to rely on a central entity to host the shell, the core blockchain of Ergo, the nodes, the explorers, and those kind of things.

[09:08] **qx()**: What the DAO does is it brings in members who have their own hardware and have a decent internet connection and uptime. And we've made a package for Explorer and Node.

[09:19] **qx()**: And we have people to run that. And once they're fully synced, we add them to the Cloudflare load balancer. And as I said earlier, geolocation spreads to those people.

[09:30] **qx()**: So right now, it's myself and two other people. A third person has spun things up on a raspberry pie, but it's just not quite fast enough.

[09:39] **qx()**: So they're actually going to get one of my spare machines here. We're going to send it to them. And there'll be a fourth person.

[09:44] **qx()**: There's two people actually from Cardano Stake Pools that we're interested as well. Once we get this fourth person up, we'll talk to those guys again and bring those in.

[09:53] **qx()**: So it's looking really good. It's looking awesome. The hope is that we have 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, it'd be amazing to have that many people on it.

[10:02] **qx()**: So that's essentially the start, right? And once we get enough people running Explorer and Node on there with GraphQL and API, we can look into other hosting methods as well.

[10:11] **qx()**: Say that the Ergo Miner now wants more robust and spread out mining core instances. We could host those on some of them. We can host things like ErgoExplorer run by Aco or SigmaSpace as well, right?

[10:32] **qx()**: That browser. So all that stuff is possible there when you deal with open source and volunteers, right? So that's the idea with that.

[10:50] **qx()**: Sigmanauts asks, we need to be louder on social media. Who runs a Sigmanauts account on X? It's been a week since the last post. Please post more high quality content in community posts.

[11:03] **qx()**: You guys, we're looking for volunteers, right? These things don't run themselves. This is community organization. If you see an issue that the posts aren't coming fast enough and you have the time to see that issue, then maybe you should take the time to be a delegate of the account and post as well.

[11:23] **qx()**: I invite everybody that wants to post in promotion of Ergo on either the Sigmanauts account where you can start off. And if you prove yourself, then we can promote you to the main Ergo platform account.

[11:36] **qx()**: Please, by all means, DM me. We'll start you up on the Sigmanauts account. And if that works, then great. We'll get you up there.

[11:44] **qx()**: But yeah, we need you. We need your help, right?

[11:54] **qx()**: Dan is sleeping, if that's what you're asking. It's probably 11 o'clock in Japan.

[12:04] **qx()**: Something I want to show you guys that's kind of cool. Let me minimize my screen here.

[12:09] **qx()**: We're going to be doing this, hopefully I'm going to make a push to CodeUTXO on this at some point.

[12:19] **qx()**: Something I've done at work here is I've noticed that there's a ton of, there's a good entry point videos, right?

[12:26] **qx()**: So a lot of people have made a lot of Ergo videos about how to set up oracles, how to set up nodes, how to make paper wallets, how to set up cold wallets, all that kind of stuff. People have made videos.

[12:41] **qx()**: But what happens is those things can't interface with AI, right?

[12:47] **qx()**: So what I found is I found that I can take, and I've done this at school first as a test, there's a piece of software called Grasshopper that's built into a 3D modeling program that's a fairly difficult piece of software, but there's a ton of video tutorials out there for it.

[13:03] **qx()**: So I've created subtitle files for these, and I've scripted in timestamps and bookmarks into every single line of the SRT file.

[13:14] **qx()**: And so then I've ingested that into a knowledge base in there, into the AI. And then when you ask it a question, not only does it come through all the steps that it reads from that knowledge base, but it also gives you exact locations of the video.

[13:27] **qx()**: So I want you to think of this as like, let's say I'm setting up a node, right? There's a lot of documentation online that the AI can access. And with the help of these videos that people setting up nodes and the AI knowing all the timestamps of that, you can actually type in, hey, I'm stuck on this part of the node. How do we get past this?

[13:48] **qx()**: Well, then the AI will write to you and say, hey, here's how you do this and this. And here's the exact spot in the video that I'm talking about. And here's another guy that does it. And here's an exact spot in the video.

[13:57] **qx()**: So it works extremely, extremely well. It's a big project to take on. But I think that would be very beneficial for the Ergo community, especially if you notice, I mean, I'm a little older here, but AI is essentially what a lot of the younger generation are using now for, like even their search engines, even like just asking stupid questions.

[14:19] **qx()**: So it's an interface that these kids are really, really used to.

[14:23] **qx()**: So we can swing that around and say, look, if you don't want to scan through 30 hours of videos on how to set up something on Ergo or how to do something on Ergo, then type it into ChatGPT and it'll take it right to that 10 second spot, the sound clip.

[14:38] **qx()**: So for not only we can do that with training videos, but we can also do that with every single AMA ever made on Ergo, right?

[14:45] **qx()**: So now when you type into AI about, hey, what about this in Ergo? What happened to this? The AI can say, well, Joe talked about it in September of 2024. In December of 2024, he gave an update. Here are the two links to those videos right at the bookmark where he spoke about those kind of things.

[15:03] **qx()**: So the possibilities are amazing for engagement and intake of information.

[15:10] **qx()**: I'm going to actually show you how it works really quickly. Let's see. I can share my screen here. Hopefully, I still have the screen correct.

[15:18] **qx()**: OK, so this is based on the application that I did for our classes here. So I can say, how do I make a spiral staircase?

[15:31] **qx()**: So it searches through the knowledge base. It searches through all those SRT files. Just imagine it's an Ergo. And it takes you through every part of the way that it knows how to do it from those videos.

[15:43] **qx()**: And you'll see each part of these lines has an actual link. So if I click on the demonstration, spiral will be a symmetrical points, it literally takes me to that exact spot in the video where it's doing that.

[15:59] **qx()**: Adjusting the radius and height takes me to the exact spot in whatever video that it's doing that.

[16:05] **qx()**: So now, as I said, imagine that with Ergo, with all the AMAs, with every single video that we've ever done, with all the tutorials of wallets or anything like that, now, you can hit that with an AI model and it can spit out those points for me.

[16:21] **qx()**: So, think about it also with somebody trying to, we said we needed help with the Sigmanauts account for Twitter.

[16:31] **qx()**: Now, think about it, that person can just go to this AI model and type in, give me some cool things that have happened in Ergo in the last month that I can make a tweet about, and quote me something from kushti too.

[16:42] **qx()**: Boom. And I'll spit that right out for you from all the media that we've put out, give you the links directly to the video so you can add that to the chat. Done.

[16:50] **qx()**: So this is something cool that I think you'll probably see in the next couple of weeks or so as I'm working on it.

[16:57] **qx()**: And once we try to host it from CodeUTXO on a local server, the credit should be very, very, very cheap as far as that goes. So look forward to that in the future.

[17:15] **qx()**: Any other questions that I could answer properly?

[17:20] **qx()**: Would I trust an AI agent with my key phrase? No. Not my main key phrase. I'd trust it with like a trading bot, probably. If I put a couple hundred dollars of ERG in a trading bot and let it go, yeah, that's fine.

[17:32] **qx()**: You always got to think you're going to lose it, potentially. Not just it's going to be compromised, but the agent's going to screw up in Dumpia or that kind of thing. So just treat it that way, right?

[17:51] **qx()**: All right. So just a reminder to everybody, short AMA today. Thanks for joining. We are moving fully to community events after this for the time being.

[17:59] **qx()**: So I hope to see all of you in chats in the Zoom meeting. Don't feel like you have to turn on your video, but please come in and ask questions in person and join us that way.

[18:11] **qx()**: Continue the evolution of Ergo to the peer-to-peer protocol and state that it actually is and get us to a point that really sets us apart more than we already are from other chains right.

[18:21] **qx()**: All right everybody thanks so much for joining and kushti and I and hopefully Joe will see you next week in community AMA ciao.
