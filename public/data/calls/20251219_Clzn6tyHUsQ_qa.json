      "question": "What is the Ergo Foundation's current transition plan and what costs are being handed over to the community?",
      "asker": "Qx",
      "answer": "The Ergo Foundation's main goal was to bootstrap the community and get things going, and we're at that crossroads now. The EF won't vanish - it could continue signing exchange listings, getting grants, and supporting development. However, there are outstanding costs that need community takeover: market making costs about $10,000-$12,000 every quarter, and the main explorer infrastructure costs about 680 euros ($720) per month on Hetzner servers with 120GB RAM for large queries.",

      "question": "How does Ergo's market maker differ from other blockchain projects?",
      "asker": "Qx",
      "answer": "Ergo has never used market makers that profit from community trades, which many other chains do - they make profit off the spreads when users trade against them. Ergo's market makers are US-friendly and do not make profits off supporting spreads and depths, which is why it costs about $12,000 every three months. This was a stipulation from the beginning to ensure the market maker doesn't extract value from the community.",

      "asker": "Qx",
      "answer": "The Infra P2P DAO is running and can handle 99% of queries, but can't do massive queries requiring 120GB RAM machines. The solution is to run beefy explorers with Qx and Jamai hosting high-performance machines, redirect main explorer traffic to those, encourage P2P node usage for regular queries, and provide developers with a list of individual machines including P2P nodes and main explorer machines for redundancy if Cloudflare goes down.",

      "question": "Why do blockchain projects need market making services?",
      "asker": "HQ3rr",
      "answer": "The sad part of the crypto industry is that you're required to have market making services if you want to maintain or sustain your tokens on exchanges. It's not that we really want to run those bots or trade, but if you want to be part of the ecosystem that crypto has become, you need to have trading volumes and all that. You need basic minimum volumes on exchanges to avoid delisting, which is why community members will run these services for the community in the future.",

      "asker": "HQ3rr",
      "answer": "If we go to more decentralized exchanges and Rosen gets more attention, then we won't be needing traditional market making. If there are more users using Rosen and DEXes on connected chains, and you have enough volume and trades with wrapped assets, you don't really need access to centralized exchanges. This is the path forward, especially considering all the scams, exploits, and shenanigans happening with centralized exchanges.",

      "asker": "Qx",
      "answer": "VoltPay is a service that works with Trocador (known in the crypto community for 6-7 years with good reputation) using multiple providers including swapper and exotics in the backend. You can swap crypto-to-crypto with no KYC, or buy prepaid cards and gift cards with crypto. For example, you select BTC to ERG, choose from four providers, send your BTC to the provider which exchanges on exchanges in the background, creating volume without you directly touching exchanges.",

      "asker": "Qx",
      "answer": "I integrated native pools of SigUSD and Dexy Gold in MewDex because I was getting sick of people asking about 'when SigUSD'. You can now swap inside the DEX and provide liquidity. There are two functions in the protocol - freemint and arbmint - so when there's a price difference, you can free mint to level the price between the LP and the bank. At bank.MewFinance.com, it shows LP price vs bank price and recommends what's best for you.",

      "asker": "CannonQ",
      "answer": "The big issue was there was a common refrain in Ergo that there was no US access. Other than New York, you now have US access with Banksa. People are complaining about the 10% fee, but everyone knew that was the fee ahead of time. If you've used any of these services, you knew it would be around 10% take rate, which is actually less than US betting apps like FanDuel that take more than 10%.",

      "asker": "HQ3rr",
      "answer": "There are people who think crypto and blockchain are the same thing, but crypto is one thing and blockchain is another. You can build anything on blockchain that's not crypto related - use blockchain as a database, validator, verifier, amplifier, or whatever you want. You have to get the dollar value out of your mind. One ERG is going to be one ERG. Just imagine how many transactions you can do with one ERG, or how many boxes you can build with the minimum 0.004 box value, or how much data you can put in registers. That's the power of blockchain and what Ergo offers.",

      "question": "What is socket integration in MewDex and how does it improve user experience?",
      "asker": "HQ3rr",
      "answer": "You can now use socket on MewDex, which means if you transfer ERG or anything to another address and connect it, you will instantly see that you have that balance. You'll be able to create transactions when they're not even confirmed yet using chained transactions. The swaps will be much faster now. The only thing that can happen on the DEX is slippage if many people are trading in the same LP at once - just change the slippage and try again.",

      "asker": "Qx",
      "answer": "In Nautilus Settings under experimental features, you can turn on zero conf which allows you to see incoming transactions as soon as they hit the mempool, before confirmation. You can then send those funds out while still in mempool using chained transactions. This works really well on Ergo - unlike other chains that start with 'E' where you need to add more fees to push transactions through, Ergo's chained transactions are very successful.",
