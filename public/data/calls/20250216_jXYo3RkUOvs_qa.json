      "answer": "According to kushti, Ergo doesn't need sub-blocks because it already has many financial tools available for experimentation. The existing infrastructure provides sufficient functionality for developers to build and experiment with various financial applications without requiring sub-block implementation.",

      "answer": "Ergo core developers chose two-minute average block times as a safety net between being too slow (like Bitcoin) and too fast for proper propagation across nodes. Every transaction needs to propagate to all nodes for consensus and be written into a block for finality, so nodes that are delayed or can't propagate fast enough can cause issues.",
