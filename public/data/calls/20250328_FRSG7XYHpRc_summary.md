# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary

**Call Date:** March 28, 2025  
**Call Title:** Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA - March 27th

## Executive Summary

This community call featured a new interactive format with multiple Sigmanauts members providing updates alongside core developer Kushti. Key highlights included Marc the Shark's report from the Mining Disrupt conference in Florida, where he gathered insights on mining pool strategies and promotional opportunities for the Sigmanauts mining pool. Kushti announced that Ergo 6.0 is nearing mainnet activation with voting potentially starting in early May, following final audits and parameter checks. The discussion emphasized Ergo's focus on creating genuine peer-to-peer money rather than pursuing high TPS solutions that compromise decentralization.

The call demonstrated strong community engagement with practical solutions being proposed, including HQ3rr's idea for a profitability calculator to show miners the additional value they receive from the Sigmanauts pool through demurrage and bonus tokens. Grayman discussed his contribution to the upcoming Ergo Book, focusing on monetary theory and the historical development of currency systems, positioning Ergo as a solution to current monetary system limitations.

## Notable Quotes

**Kushti on Ergo's purpose**: "I think we should be in the space not for tech, but for money, right? But not in the sense of this retarded crypto industry. So, yeah, it should be about reworking money, right? And tech is just tooling after all."

**Grayman on cryptocurrency development**: "This is the stuff that a hundred years from now, nobody's going to remember any of that. And what they're going to remember is what are the concrete steps that were taken by devs that changed the way that money works and that eventually get adopted because it becomes inevitable."
