# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Title:** Ergo PoW Blockchain - Community Chat - October 9th

## Executive Summary

The Ergo community call focused on celebrating the successful activation of version 6.0, which introduced the new sub-blocks parameter that miners can now vote on. The activation was described as "flawless" by lead developer Kushti, who is now working on the sub-blocks white paper. A significant portion of the discussion centered around community-driven marketing initiatives, particularly a new "Raiders" group launched by community member Aberg to coordinate Twitter engagement campaigns.

Development updates included progress on Sigma SDK examples generated with AI assistance, GitCircles nearing deployment for onboarding developer communities, and advancement on Chain Cash and basis implementations. The team also discussed upcoming stable coin deployments using the new USD Oracle pool, which is running smoothly. An in-person meetup is planned for Colorado Springs featuring presentations from multiple community developers and researchers.

## Notable Quotes

**Kushti on grassroots marketing**: "I think community efforts can easily help perform that especially in 2025 because well... Paid marketing did work well back in 2017, 18... but these days, I don't know, so we have like thousands of different blockchain projects... it's just totally tasteless flow of low quality content basically."

**Kushti on Bitcoin OG appeal**: "I think it's quite easy to sell Ergo to Bitcoin OGs... They're quite fond of, especially recently, when I started to describe all the ideas around Chain Cash and so on. How can we realistically separate money from the state? That's the very original idea of Bitcoin."

**qx() on organic growth**: "What I find is that sometimes the most effective thing, at least for Twitter, is it's the initial hit right after the post. From the things that we've seen go big, if we have an initial hit of quite a few people, that seems to get it in front of more people's eyes and then it multiplies beyond that."
