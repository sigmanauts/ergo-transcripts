# Ergoversary 2025 Community Call Summary

**Call Date:** July 1, 2025  
**Call Title:** Looking to the Future | Armeanio and Kushti | Ergoversary 2025

## Executive Summary

This Ergoversary call focused on Ergo's future direction, particularly around building "better money" for global economic challenges and implementing advanced blockchain infrastructure. Kushti and Armeanio discussed the current state of global financial systems, highlighting issues with spiraling debt, inflation, and declining economic freedom. They outlined Ergo's role in creating open-source financial tools and explored technical developments including sub-blocks implementation, sidechains, and merge-mining capabilities.

The conversation emphasized Ergo's commitment to fair distribution through proof-of-work consensus and contrasted this with the current trend of pre-centralized projects and "rugpull" schemes in the cryptocurrency space. Key technical developments discussed include the upcoming 6.0 node release with sub-blocks support, potential merge-mined sidechains (including double merge-mining with Bitcoin), and the broader "Better Money Initiative" aimed at providing financial tools for underserved global markets.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Better Money Initiative**: Focus on creating open-source financial tools to address global debt, inflation, and economic surveillance issues
• **Sub-blocks Implementation**: Final preparation for 6.0 node release with sub-blocks support for improved network performance
• **Merge-mined Sidechains**: Plans for additional revenue streams for miners through sidechains, potentially including Bitcoin double merge-mining
• **Proof-of-Work Advantages**: Discussion of PoW efficiency compared to Proof-of-Stake, emphasizing asynchronous consensus benefits
• **ChainCash and Digital Free Banking**: Development of blockchain-based banking infrastructure for underserved markets
• **Real-World Asset Integration**: Addressing trust issues and building better frameworks for tokenizing commodities and other assets
• **Sigma Chains Concept**: Dedicated proof-of-work chains to utilize different hardware classes and create specialized applications
• **Privacy-oriented Solutions**: Potential for private contract sidechains using advanced cryptography
• **Fair Distribution**: Critique of current "rugpull" culture and emphasis on proof-of-work as the solution to fair token distribution

## Decisions Made

• Miners should update to 6.0 nodes and configure voting settings for sub-blocks activation
• DevNet will be updated with sub-block support by video release
• Public testnet integration with sub-blocks planned for July 2025
• Priority focus on implementing merge-mined sidechains as "low-hanging fruit"
• Better Money Initiative to move from theoretical development to practical implementation

## Notable Quotes

> "The world needs better money, it needs better collateral, and we're kind of still stuck in this cycle of spiraling debt that's growing exponentially across the globe." - **Armeanio**

> "The problem of fair distribution was solved back in 2009, right? And it's proof of work... And then people somehow lost it again." - **Kushti**

> "It would be better to launch some Ergo similar sigma chain, right, with the idea to get rails with Ergo, and then Rosen Bridge since day one, so liquidity with all the chains." - **Kushti**

## Participants

• **Armeanio** - Community leader/developer discussing strategic direction and economic philosophy
