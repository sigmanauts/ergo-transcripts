      "question": "How does PandaVee's blockchain-based access control system work?",
      "asker": "implied",
      "answer": "PandaVee uses the Ergo blockchain to create a secure access control system where each user's entry rights are verified using a unique token ID. This replaces traditional cards or passwords with a secure on-chain identity, and every access event is immutably recorded on the blockchain for full transparency and tamper-proof security.",

      "answer": "PandaVee integrates with Ergonode and ErgoPay to activate Arduino-based hardware and unlock doors. The system uses ErgoPay for user authentication and signing, while transactions are processed through Ergonode and recorded on the Ergo blockchain.",

      "asker": "implied",
      "answer": "Users log in using ErgoPay signing, and their session ID is recorded in the PandaVee server. The app displays a list of NFT tokens from the user's Ergo wallet, and clicking a token generates a QR code that binds the session ID with the wallet address for authentication.",

      "asker": "implied",
      "answer": "When the QR code is scanned, the server determines if the QR is valid, then grants access and opens the gate or door. A transaction is pushed and submitted to the Ergo blockchain, and all transaction IDs can be verified on Ergo Explorer for transparency.",
