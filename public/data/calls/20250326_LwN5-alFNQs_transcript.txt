[00:01] **qx()**: Welcome to the live Ergo developer update with me tonight.

[00:09] **qx()**: I have the amazing, the elusive, the very busy Joseph Armeanio.

[00:16] **Armeanio**: How are you doing, John?

[00:18] **Armeanio**: I'm doing all right. Busy week.

[00:21] **Armeanio**: What is it today? Tuesday?

[00:23] **qx()**: You know, I've lost track, honestly.

[00:24] **Armeanio**: Feels a little deeper in the week than Tuesday, but that's how life goes sometimes.

[00:29] **qx()**: It does. I like to say what a week it's been today.

[00:36] **qx()**: You say that on Monday. That's half my life usually.

[00:41] **qx()**: Let me stick the link in chat so people can join us. There we go. Live link is in chat.

[00:46] **qx()**: All right, guys, we're live with the Ergo update. Joe managed to find some colored beverage in his closet.

[00:53] **qx()**: I am also cheersing to Ergo and its success.

[00:58] **qx()**: And we're going to bring you all the news of the ecosystem from last week and maybe some bullshit along the way. We'll see. Joe, what do you want to talk about tonight?

[01:12] **Armeanio**: I don't know. I haven't been paying that much attention to be honest with the latest bullshit in the crypto space. There's always something going on.

[01:18] **qx()**: Well, I think we got some more official pumping of the Trump token from Trump's truth social account. I saw that this week.

[01:31] **qx()**: I don't know where to start with that stuff, Joe. When are the people that are using blockchain for its intended purpose going to outnumber the people that are just using it to get rich quick or steal money from other people? When's that going to happen, Joe?

[01:52] **Armeanio**: It's hard to say. I think we're going to see a split in the crypto space at some point, right? Because if you look at what's trending in popular at this point, it's institutional adoption, using stable coins to absorb treasuries, creating the regulatory beginning of stable coins.

[02:24] **Armeanio**: I think that generally once something is under the purview of regulators that tends to move more in a ratchet, like one direction, rather than it starts and then that's it forever, right?

[02:40] **Armeanio**: So I think we're probably gonna see some kind of public-private partnership digital money that may not have the greatest assumptions in terms of surveillance.

[02:56] **qx()**: We're gonna see a lot of that stuff, yeah.

[02:59] **Armeanio**: The ability to seize it. With stable coins more, we're probably going to be moving in the direction where there's just a lot more financial surveillance that's possible on public blockchain.

[03:14] **Armeanio**: And then the question is, how do we get to privacy? Right? Because that's something that I think in some sense, the market will demand it, right? And that's kind of an open question.

[03:30] **Armeanio**: We have this idea of confidentiality where you're kind of trusting someone won't reveal your information rather than true privacy assumption, which is where you're trusting the cryptography that's actually concealing your information.

[03:45] **Armeanio**: It's interesting. From my personal perspective, and it could be wrong and I hope I'm wrong, is that generally in the Western consciousness, you have a public private partnership and you have powers on the back end and people can invest in the prison that they live in. They're happy.

[04:13] **Armeanio**: Because then you have the profit incentive, right? We've seen this already with a lot of - you can look at Gmail, you could look at Facebook, you can look at a lot of these public private partnerships that have in the back end that end up giving way too much data information that doesn't really benefit users other than the user experience of it, which even then is somewhat hard to argue.

[04:59] **Armeanio**: I think there's always an equal opposite polarity, right? It's like thermodynamics when it comes to energy and probably also culture too. Where if we do see more institutional adoption and we do see more surveillance and tracking compliance based tooling that's forced on people, I do think that that is the best narrative privacy projects and resilient neutral money has ever seen.

[05:26] **qx()**: So mainstream blockchain adoption, right? I think we're gonna - I think it's so vast and so different. DJ, if you have a question, pop it in there. No problem. It's so vast and different that it's going to be such a myriad of things out there. I think we're going to see a ton of centralization, a ton of controlled assets. As you said, that you can mock down and you don't really have control of it.

[05:56] **qx()**: But we're going to see blockchain adoption to where you don't even have an idea that the blockchain is happening in the background. Like you're interacting with something and boom like I was thinking the other day like with all these AI fakes out there, right? And you can't trust videos or pictures anymore. If Joe's gonna publish a video, what better way to signify that Joe is the owner of that video and actually publish it by putting the checksum of the video in a transaction on chain signed with Joe's wallet then we know right off the bat that it's Joe's kind of thing. So those kind of things can be in the background people won't even know that it's a case, but it's easily look up, and it's resilient cause it's on tons of different nodes and that kind of thing to the point where we also have peer to peer finance institutions where you have the bank of Joe, the bank of QX and all that kind of stuff.

[06:41] **qx()**: I don't think it's going to be one thing and that's it. We have to be ready for the fact that peer to peer be a big chunk, but it might be an outlier as well at some point.

[06:52] **Armeanio**: Yeah, to some degree, I think we need to take a step back and realize what is a blockchain? It's a ledger. From a close-up perspective, it's a ledger that's just replicated around the world, hopefully.

[07:23] **Armeanio**: If you have a single signer ledger, I don't know why blockchain is really the way. A lot of the best properties of something like Bitcoin itself had to do with the fact that it's distributed enough that it's kind of unstoppable, right?

[07:36] **Armeanio**: That's really where I started to gain interest in this space is this idea of saying, if we can create neutral money and it's the system out there that anybody with an internet connection can potentially connect with or interact with, you just remove so many barriers of trade and commerce and expression and exchange between people.

[08:04] **Armeanio**: And so when you get into it's a centralized system, I don't see why it's even worth mentioning to be honest. I mean, there are other database structures that are probably more performant, right?

[08:21] **qx()**: Yeah. And that plays into the part where I don't think the centralized - I don't think at least a peer to peer decentralized - let's take the US, right. And some of the major players, right. I think that's going to be an obvious adoption of centralized structures that they have control over. I don't think that peer-to-peer decentralized networks are going to be widely embraced by governments per se, right? They're built for the individual so that they're on the same footing as the person with insider information or the person with more money or that kind of thing.

[08:54] **qx()**: So I think we'll see that kind of peer-to-peer adoption on a broader scale across the world as opposed to let's hope that the U.S. government picks up Ergo or something. It's not going to happen, right?

[09:06] **Armeanio**: Yeah, I think it's interesting to see how any type of internet technology can potentially remove boundaries, right? We're in a Discord channel or a Telegram or Signal and we're talking to kind of a global audience in a frictionless way. We're communicating, exchanging ideas.

[09:27] **Armeanio**: And so this idea where if you do have these internet protocols, you can open markets, which is powerful, right? I think that's ultimately the main interesting use case for stable coins in a way, is you have this ability to expand the dollar's reach into a cross border environment without having to deal with exchange markets, right? You use Internet technology to bypass a lot of the physical infrastructure that you'd normally have to deal with.

[10:01] **Armeanio**: And so we probably will see a lot of adoption of dollars we already have with USDT. That's one of its more interesting aspects has always been these local money exchanges that will kind of create their own conversion and kind of ramp people to the dollar or dollar exposure and circumvent whatever system they're in. So I do think there's value there. It's just a question of data availability for the user and control functions in the backend that I'm just not a fan of.

[10:43] **qx()**: Yeah, I can see tiered blockchain ledger tiers essentially with centralized blockchains will only expose this part of the transaction or the chain to you at this tier or always ways to sell the data that you're collecting. Absolutely crazy. But you're talking about stable, right? I briefly read an article that things like gold, silver are becoming more attractive, stable options, as opposed to the US dollar, right?

[11:15] **Armeanio**: Well, I think that many people have called the dollar the cleanest dirty shirt in terms of currencies. There's a lot of debt backing the dollar. We're in a weird position in a lot of different ways with humanity. It's just honest. The debt burden globally is huge. We've gone through this rapid acceleration of technology to where we went through the mechanical age and then the electronic age and then the internet age. Now we're entering into the machine mind age.

[11:55] **qx()**: Yep. Absolutely crazy. We're live at this time. It's like somebody's great grandfather had an outhouse in the field, right?

[12:04] **Armeanio**: Yeah, exactly.

[12:06] **qx()**: Now we're moving into the age of artificial intelligence emerging and all kinds of - you can synthesize a dead parent's voice, like I can synthesize my mother's voice and feed her all the emails she's ever sent me ever and then have a chat with her. It's insane. Absolutely.

[12:25] **Armeanio**: So I mean, technology is accelerating. Social consciousness hasn't really caught up with where the edge of that is - it's kind of a wake effect where it takes a while to bleed through to the masses but the tip of the spear there is moving faster and faster and faster.

[12:46] **Armeanio**: So it's going to be disruptive, right? I would say that when you look at technology as it develops, it's a force multiplier. And so we are moving again through probably a decade of disruption where everybody that has a shovel is going to get displaced by somebody that has a backhoe. And I think people have a certain awareness of that, in my opinion.

[13:16] **qx()**: Yeah, it'll be interesting. How do we get to a point where people start? I mean, American stuff, right. In America, you sit back and you say, I don't agree with this administration, but I'm not going to do anything about it. So you have this kind of - I'll just focus on me and my local network. And I'll be good to the people that are in my local network.

[14:02] **qx()**: Yeah, that's true. Local networks important, but I'm thinking about not just the US outside of the US at one point. At one point, if the knowledge is given, these people start saying, you know what, I'm going to take control of my own assets, my own ability to make sure that somebody's not screwing me over. These tooling that can guarantee kind of a predictable manner in how it's being executed, right?

[14:34] **qx()**: At what point does an average person that is being affected, like Joe, we got it easy, right? I mean, we got it really easy, right? We have jobs, we have house, we have those kinds of things. So we can go to the bank, get a loan, we can take money out of the bank, but that's not the majority of the world, right? So my question is, how do we - I guess it's a slow burn, right? Eventually it's a slow burn. How do we get that information in the people's hands that it really does matter for their livelihood about these kinds of changes that'll make a big difference in their lives?

[15:09] **Armeanio**: I tend to think that the best way to do something like that is teach by example. If you're talking about more mature financial tools, the crypto space is a bit immature. We have to be honest.

[15:26] **qx()**: I'm going to have to edit that one out, Joe.

[15:27] **qx()**: Oh, yeah, shoot. We're live.

[15:29] **Armeanio**: Sorry. No. I mean, listen, a lot of the times if somebody that's not familiar with crypto asked me what I do, I say I try to work with open source financial software. Versus crypto. And then it's an interesting conversation. Well, what is that? I say, well, it's this ability to see and understand the system that you interact with.

[15:58] **qx()**: How do you argue against that? That doesn't - that's got to sound attractive to almost anybody.

[16:01] **Armeanio**: Yeah. Then people are genuinely interested because it's like, well, I've never thought that - I go to the bank and I have no idea what their balance sheet is or no idea who's holding the mortgage to my house because it's been auctioned off X amount of times or titles.

[16:17] **qx()**: Your student loans go through like 10 different fricking people.

[16:22] **Armeanio**: If you get into this idea of having different assumptions in the system, the financial system, people are interested in that, right? Because many people are, they've either thought about it and it's kind of a wild thing or they haven't thought about it. You pay off your house. Who owns the title to your house? Yeah, it usually gets passed packaged and passed around. Who owns the title to your car? Who owns your student loan?

[16:53] **Armeanio**: The type of inability to see into our financial system is fascinating, yet the mirror is put on the user where they're constantly wanting to know who are you, how much do you have and where did it come from. Which in some sense is a very weird relationship.

[17:18] **Armeanio**: If I just met you and I'm saying, hey, QX, can you look after my money? And you're saying, well, who are you? And where'd you get this? And me as the person who actually has the money that's handing it to you, what do I get in terms of transparency from that side? It's interesting.

[17:40] **Armeanio**: It's so normal that nobody questions it, but there's a lot of things in this world that are so normal that nobody really questions it. And I think that money is one of the things that when you really start to question what's happening in terms of the system itself, it's a deep and weird hole.

[18:00] **qx()**: It is. And you're talking about are the money makers that made me think like on chain, right? I can - even the layman essentially can see a transaction in your wallet and see where it's going, see what it's like. They might want to be able to read a smart contract, but at least they can go to GitHub in just the whole thing into an AI and maybe ask it what it's doing so they may have an idea when you sign off for a mortgage like - you sign, you're not reading those 800 pages that you're signing, right? You have no clue, just kind of the general ideas of what's happening with that paper that you're signing.

[18:44] **Armeanio**: One of the more interesting aspects of learning machine models really is this idea of being able to digest large amounts of information and spit something out to the user like something is off here. Right? Because it takes a lot of time and energy to dive through that. Can you hear the dog?

[19:05] **qx()**: I love it. It's fine. It's a good background. Guys, don't worry about it, Joe.

[19:10] **qx()**: All right. There's probably like an eight foot bear out back trying to swat him or something.

[19:15] **Armeanio**: Yeah, I know.

[19:19] **qx()**: All right, let's see. We got a question here really quick. Karim says, Spectrum Finance needs to come back strong. You know, I get it, but they don't necessarily need to. We've got all the contracts online. We've got the that are open source. We've got the UI that's open source. Anybody can pick it up and start cranking out more features. MewFinance did it. They took the front end and did a ton of optimization tweaks to it and using the smart contracts for the pools. So anybody can do it. That's the beauty of it. I don't think - we gotta try to stop creating idols, right? We gotta stop creating like, oh, this is a thing that's gonna save us or that kind of thing.

[20:06] **Armeanio**: Yeah, I think that's the better option is just ideate and push for ideas. Yeah, there are some interesting options for decentralized exchange that haven't been explored on Ergo. It'd be really cool to see.

[20:15] **qx()**: Joe, I'm just waiting for you to build a DEX into Rosen Bridge.

[20:19] **Armeanio**: To build a DEX into Rosen Bridge? Well, I think it's better to build around Rosen Bridge. And the reason why is because you have a system that doesn't rehypothecate assets, holds collateral one-to-one. And when you start to seek yield or swaps internally, you create a much messier situation in terms of being able to audit the fact that there's no rehypothecation.

[20:49] **Armeanio**: So you could get into cross-chain swaps, it's doable, but it's not necessarily changing the protocol of the bridge itself. I think sometimes there's a way to make Rosen faster that's relatively straightforward, basically.

[21:09] **qx()**: Right. Rosen fastening.

[21:11] **Armeanio**: Right. What you would do is you would require a premium fee on the person that's bridging, and you would use the bridge protocol in the background, and you would simply have liquidity providers that front an element of weaker assumptions, release funds, and then get paid as the original transaction goes through.

[21:34] **qx()**: Yeah, you want fast pay a premium, right?

[21:36] **Armeanio**: That's kind of how the banking system works, right? You can send something faster and add a little bit of -

[21:45] **qx()**: Speaking of speaking of Rosen and Fastlane and that kind of stuff, I was speaking to - I was helping out a guy who's spinning up a watcher on Aragore, I believe, first, and he's looking at Cardano. And he is one of his questions was - Do you, can I use the same collateral? The 30,000 Rosen and the 800 ERG. Can I use the same collateral for Cardano and Ergo? And I was like, no, I said it's a completely separate set of collateral. You have to actually run a separate watcher. You can't just put both in the same file. And that sounds like a bummer to the person running it.

[22:22] **qx()**: But that's the beauty of ROSIN is that you're forcing a distributed method, even if I'm the same person running three watchers, right? I'm running it on probably three different computers. Yeah, I'm running it on three different computers on two different networks. So you're forcing kind of this distribution, right? Of course, some people are going to run onto the same machine. But still, the smart thing is, I'm going to run my watches on three different machines because I have them. Because if one machine goes down, I don't lose out on all three profits, I only lose out on one profit until I fix it. And then the other two machines are still picking up profits for the chains that I'm on. So with that model that you're doing, you're kind of forcing this spread out decentralization, even among individuals who are doing more than one watcher set. So I think it's a brilliant idea that you're requiring liquidity for both staking liquidity for both for any chain that you go on for each watcher, essentially.

[23:16] **Armeanio**: So that was just an economic friction to create.

[23:23] **qx()**: Yep.

[23:23] **Armeanio**: That's why it's there.

[23:24] **qx()**: Awesome. All right, we've got another question. Dejan wants to know if Ergo is kushti's main thing or he's got a side hustle. Also, same question for developers. Where is money coming from to finance Ergo development? Good question.

[23:44] **Armeanio**: Oh, that's a good question. Let's see, I've worked with kushti for quite a while. I don't think he's actually been paid by anybody since about 2021.

[23:53] **qx()**: I know, I don't think so.

[23:53] **Armeanio**: So it's a question of saying, why? Why would somebody put years of their life into building something that is subject to hyper volatility and is subject to people that are constantly aggressive and people that are constantly quite pushy? And you have no direct financial incentive to do that in terms of salary. It's because he, number one, he enjoys developing.

[24:29] **Armeanio**: What gets him excited is to read research papers and think, what is possible? But actually, the thing that probably interests him the most is kind of the idea of free banking. And I think that just comes from his perspective of the world, seeing kind of the state of the world, seeing technology, seeing what's potentially possible and how that could benefit and change systems and improve people's lives. A lot of crazy shit happens on planet Earth because of our money systems.

[25:02] **qx()**: Greed, money, yep.

[25:04] **Armeanio**: Yeah, well, I mean, it's like the ability to print money is the ability to fund wars. You usually have hyper centralization and Cantillon effects and the downstream effects of that warp.

[25:22] **qx()**: Not just like, you have the power, you have the money printing, look at the US right now, right? They're prolific money printers, we are. And not only that, but we have the power to actually hurt other economies, right? So we can not only print our own money, but we can then hurt other economies strategically during that process, to even bolster a dollar even more. So it's frickin insane.

[25:49] **Armeanio**: I mean, it's a tool of power and control. It's a weird system, right? So I guess from some high level, the question is if you can change the emission consensus around money and you can change the distribution mechanics around money. And you can build systems that are more transparent. That also offer the potential to be more private, that also offer all of these - I think that as systems advance, a lot of exotic financial instruments that were at one point only reserved for the select few will become common. And then things will get interesting, right?

[26:39] **Armeanio**: So, yeah, I don't know. I think his motivation is just simply based on where his passion is and where his understanding of how technology could potentially change things. One of the things that tends to get Alex the most excited is the idea of free banking, which is in a way very, very different than the layer one blockchain attitude, right?

[27:12] **qx()**: The commercial attitude. Yeah, yeah, yeah, 100%. And it doesn't take much to learn that about kushti, right? Read his forum post, check him out on Twitter. And it's very - It's very apparent early on that if that's his attitude and that's his core principle of supporting that kind of self sovereignty of your own right.

[27:34] **Armeanio**: There's a lot of people that don't want to touch the money systems in the world. They want to enhance it. And we're seeing that with stable coin adoption. Well, I think the funnier thing to do is touch the money. Touch the money, change the system. And crypto has kind of gone full circle to where we started. It's kind of like fuck the central banks. And now it's literally let them power the central banks and take bonds and mint dollars, which is a wild turn of events. But I don't know. Different time, different era, I guess.

[28:08] **qx()**: Yeah, my second part of that question is where is money coming from to finance Ergo development? And that's a great answer on that. It speaks to the resiliency of Ergo, right? There's money coming from all right. So there's money from the EF for bounties, right? And then there's project money, right? There's those projects that have posted or have started projects and gotten support funding. Look at Palmyra. Look at Crux Finance. Look at MewFinance. Look at all those kind of things on Ergo so far. But the crux of the matter is that the idea is that - And that makes us resilient, right? Is there's no funding to dry up. kushti's developing as he is.

[28:58] **Armeanio**: I said we're poor.

[28:59] **qx()**: So people are developing because they believe in the cause of there should be some fair system that's out there for anybody to use. Right. And you can't dry that up. Right. That's a cause that people are willing to pick up and fight for.

[29:15] **Armeanio**: So I think it simply goes to this idea of adding value to a system. If you add value to a system, you enhance it, right? And so a lot of the developers that I know that work on Ergo, they're adding value to the system to enhance the value of the system. That's why they develop.

[29:37] **qx()**: Right, and that's the beauty of Ergo, right? Because the Ergo community and Ergo itself, that's literally on the Ergo Manifesto about what its purpose is for. So go to another chain such as Ethereum. You'll be drowned out, right? You start speaking like this. Well, let's make a fair mining. Well, let's say back when Ethereum was proof of work, right? You do a fair mining initiative where you have something like Lithos with distributed miners collectively coming together, right? That possibly could be drowned out because that's not of interest to people trying to make buck or make millions of dollars off that kind of thing. So on Ergo, it's the interesting value of the chain is that we're building for something better, right?

[30:24] **qx()**: Yeah, that's the goal. Of course, there are people in there that want to double or triple or 10 times or 100 times their investment on that. OK, you deserve it. Actually, if you're investing in a project like Ergo early on, sure, whatever. You deserve that kind of thing. But I'd say the meat of the people that are here in Ergo, the developers that are working on it are working on it for that cause. Right. They're here for a reason because they believe in what Ergo is and what it represents. They believe in the mission statement. And that's why they're here, I think. So these bull markets, these bear markets, it doesn't matter. There's always somebody that believes in Ergo that's still building and continuing really cool stuff.

[31:04] **Armeanio**: That's where Bitcoin came from, in a way. There was no direct funding sources from the chain. It was just proof of work. And you can look at Litecoin, proof of work. That's changed a lot, right? The incentive structure in crypto has gotten a lot different over time. Or I would say just things are way more centralized. But yeah, I think that if you're going to raise funds, I've always been an advocate for build a product that's public facing and open source. Right. And which is interesting because that's probably backwards for how most people fundraise today.

[31:50] **qx()**: No, you know, I said that to the blockchain group that I speak that I gave a lecture to. I said, the scary thing about open source is that anybody can take your stuff and spin it up and try it themselves. I said so. So the issue, the challenge that our developers face, the community developers on Ergo when they open source their projects are that they now need to think that, code's all open source, anybody can take out of the spin. So I need to come up with some unique property that makes me better than anybody else that would be trying to run my code, right? And that could be customer service, that could be the interface that they're pumping from. So it opens up a whole new world of competition with this open source stuff that doesn't exist with closed source stuff, right? It's absolutely amazing to watch.

[32:37] **Armeanio**: I tend to think of that from a totally different angle.

[32:40] **qx()**: All right, let's see.

[32:41] **Armeanio**: So if somebody rebuilds a Rosen bridge, that's better. And it leads to more adoption. Fuck yeah, do it.

[32:49] **qx()**: You may lose half your team to that new company, right?

[32:53] **qx()**: Fuck it.

[32:54] **Armeanio**: It's a matter of progress. I don't know, look at Bitcoin or any type of science - you build on the shoulders of those before you. That is progress. That is how progress is made. So if I come up with an open source idea that I pursue and it's retooled in a way that is better, that's awesome, right? Because what am I trying to get rid of - Rosen is trying to disrupt middlemen, right? If we can get around the friction of that in terms of listing access and access to liquidity, amazing, do it.

[33:42] **Armeanio**: If we look at Lithos. If we look at Lithos, it's a matter of putting the best assumptions to miners, right? If somebody else can do that, I think that the idea itself is beneficial because of what it provides. So if somebody can rebuild it in a way that's better, I'm happy.

[34:13] **qx()**: Right. That's scary. And I agree that that's one point of it, right? That's one way to look at it. But it's tough to attract a lot of develop. You got to be kind of a developer with big balls, I guess. And I hate to see I hate to use big balls. Elon Musk has ruined the big balls thing.

[34:32] **Armeanio**: Give me one second.

[34:34] **qx()**: Yeah, I'll keep talking. So I feel it's tough to you have to get a really strong developer that's really confident with those kind of things and recognize that I need to kick ass and Oh, hey, puppy. Hey, buddy, that's a puppy. with little needle teeth. I really need to kick butt and give something that somebody else isn't going to give if I want to stay ahead of the curve. And that drives progress for both sides, right? So I think it's great in that matter.

[35:04] **qx()**: Let's see, what else? What else are there questions? Is this guy going to bite you? Well, what a cutie, what a cutie.

[35:14] **qx()**: Let's see. Any other questions? Smart AI Learning says currently AI can generate and play 3D games within a model as seen in Google projects. If AI generated mining becomes possible, how might it impact other algorithms? I don't think there - I mean, mining is still going to create, still going to be requiring of power, right? You're still going to need something to actually compute the problem that the blockchain is presenting you with. So I'm not sure what you're asking that Smart AI, but perhaps you're speaking about generated mining. That doesn't make sense to me.

[36:01] **Armeanio**: I have no idea.

[36:01] **qx()**: Yeah, so as far as mining goes, there's no way around solving the problem, right? Even if you use AI to try to solve the problem, you're still using a crap ton of video cards to do it, right? So the power consumption might equal out the same there, if that's what you're asking for. If you're asking for other things about if AI or quantum computers essentially can figure out that kind of thing, well, Ergo's kind of got that figured out already in that Joe's idea on sigma chains or side chains can create quantum resistant chains that you can move your store value over to, to protect it. Things like that can always be made. Ergo can kind of stay on the head of the curve like that. So that's what I love about Ergo too, Joe, is that the ability to pivot is freaking insane with a project like Ergo, right? When you have open source, you can always tweak it, always modify it, you can always extend it. So it gives you a lot of flexibility.

[37:02] **qx()**: Yeah, I see the same thing at our college. We have - we're one of the smaller colleges inside Cornell University, the architecture department. And I will say to my counterparts, they're like, what are you doing? And what are you doing? I'm like, I just spun this up the other day. And I threw it at the students. They're like, What? And I'm like, Yeah, who cares? This is a cool thing that we're trying to do. And the students can test it out for us. They like it. They like it. If they don't, they don't. And people in bigger entities just can't do that, and especially when things are closed source. So yeah, I think Ergo really champions at that where they have the ability to just pivot on a dime. kushti can say hey, let's try to think of this or a community dev can come on and do that. But yeah, that's what I love about Ergo the ability to pivot on a freaking time about that kind of stuff. Your dog's adorable Joe.

[37:57] **qx()**: I look at it as a success, honestly, that there's not a lot of demand for a token launch platform. Now, you may say, there's not many projects starting in Ergo, blah, blah, blah. That's why it's not needed. The way I look at it is that there's so much tooling involved in Ergo with airdrops tools, with token distribution tools. Sigma Lock should be coming out any time now. We're waiting for kushti when he gets a free second to review the contracts. That's all. There's so many things and toolings on Ergo that things like Bulbar, things like GreasyCex, things like - What else? All these other projects can launch and do token distribution without even using a platform like that.

[39:08] **qx()**: So I see that as not only, hey, it sucks that Ergopad can't sustain their model on Ergo, but the decks are kind of stacked against them with that kind of open source tooling that anybody can use and jump onto. Did you send your puppy away, Joe?

[39:53] **qx()**: You have little Ergo bird things for your puppies.

[40:01] **qx()**: Oh, Joe hit the wrong button.

[40:06] **qx()**: All right. Let's see. We can jump into the... Let's see if he's still here, actually. What did he mute? One moment. There's he just muted his video. That's all. No biggie. He's probably spanking his puppies.

[40:24] **qx()**: All right. So back to let's see if we have any questions we can answer while he's gone.

[40:34] **qx()**: New world disorder says you can't change the world, but you can change your world.

[40:37] **qx()**: Yeah, exactly.

[40:39] **Armeanio**: You can change your network, too.

[40:40] **qx()**: Right, right. That was back when we were talking about outside of the US recognizing that these toolings are great for them. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. I mean, the centralized systems are louder, much louder much more appealing to people but I think slowly by slowly we'll get more and more people over to the side of where you feel like there's a benefit to being in control of your own bank of your own resources. Yeah I think we're in the infancy stages of it that's for sure that is for sure I think we're pretty early in what these protocols will be capable of. Did you beat your dog Joe? No just outside.

[41:23] **qx()**: You got a bone you can throw him?

[41:26] **Armeanio**: Yeah, just throw a ball.

[41:28] **qx()**: So I used to live in. Before I live in town here where I am now, I used to live in the in the boonies. We had 35 acres, not much the Colorado standards, Joe, but it was pretty good for New York standards. So we have 35 acres and our dogs used to love to run outside, right? You just let him outside it, whatever time they'd come back when they were ready kind of thing. But those puppies would bring back like deer ribs or like a whole leg of a deer. Your dogs do that to you. Sometimes it's just a huge bone in the yard. You're like, okay, where the hell did that come from? That happens. And you get the dewormer out, then you get the shots out.

[42:08] **qx()**: All right. Mark the shark. Mark the shark, everybody. Mark the shark's got a question, but Mark the shark is in Florida right now. He's going to the Mining Disrupt Conference. He's going to spread the glory of GPU mining and peer-to-peer networks. So that's going to be - Awesome that Mark's there. We've never been to district before, it's mainly a Bitcoin focused I imagine Joe right Bitcoin probably So, it's gonna be nice to have him there putting the GPU mining in people's ears the word of Ergo and all that kind of stuff.

[42:52] **qx()**: Don't worry about your dog Joe. We can hear you. It's no big deal. Just shake it off. Really don't worry about it.

[43:01] **qx()**: Alright, Mark the shark says with sub-blocks could make a tool to compete with Zelle - seems it runs similar to a blockchain. Zelle is what Zelle's a cash transaction app, right? Transferring money to each other peer to peer, right? That's so that's what I feel the attractiveness of sub-blocks will be, right? One thing people need to remember is that finality is key, right? Finality is the security that dApp providers and central exchanges are going to rely on. So whether if Ergo settles in two minutes and they say 10 blocks is what we trust that is not going to be rolled back on the chain. I don't think it's ever been a rollback on Ergo, but whatever. Sub-blocks doesn't really change that from a dApp or a central exchange point of view, right? Because as kushti said, these are kind of weak blocks, right? So they're still going to want some sort of confirmation in there that gives them the finality and the trust that they can say, yeah, OK, you've transferred us $10,000. Go ahead and take it out of your bank.

[44:05] **qx()**: What sub-blocks is going to be a boon for is for peer-to-peer transactions, right? It's going to allow me to transfer ones to Joe within a few seconds, then hop off that with chain transactions, all of that kind of thing. So yes, Mark's totally right. Mark, that sub-blocks will be a great addition for these kind of really fast peer-to-peer transactions that you can kind of have a soft finality for. So yeah, looking forward to that.

[44:35] **qx()**: I think kushti just released RC3 for Mining Testnet. I'm still on RC2 for Mining Testnet. So there's no real need to upgrade. But yeah, excited to see the progress on that.

[44:53] **qx()**: Your dog's all right, Joe. Joe, it's like babysitting three-year-olds. You're babysitting your nieces, your nephews, dogs. It might be easier with three-year-olds, Joe. I'd tell you, they'd be asleep by now, I think.

[45:10] **Armeanio**: No, there's a lot of potential applications that that opens up. The big question is just going to be the assumptions of settlement, right?

[45:22] **qx()**: Exactly. Yep. So I think, yeah, honestly, I think it's going to be a big plus to peer to peer kind of things. You walk up to a friend, you send them money, boom, it's done. It's there with sub-blocks. You want to withdraw $30,000 from exchange. You send $30,000 worth of ERGs to the exchange. Yeah. They're going to probably still wait for 10, 20 main blocks for that kind of transaction to finalize. So don't think that that's going to make it any faster there, but yeah.

[45:54] **qx()**: What else, Joe?

[46:03] **Armeanio**: I don't know. Any other questions?

[46:07] **qx()**: My sister got me this candle for a white elephant gift at Christmas. I haven't burnt it yet. No other questions. We can keep going. Let's talk about, why don't we talk about the dev updates and then we can come back to shooting the shit if we get there and we're still awake. Sound good?

[46:28] **qx()**: All right. Let's see. I'm going to hit the dev update button. It's going to switch scenes. Oh, beautiful. Perfect. All right. Do you have the dev update in front of you, Joe?

[46:39] **qx()**: All right. Perfect. The first one, this is from 319. This is an NBR with Nautilus. They released version 1.1.0. And since we haven't done an update yet, since 1.0, everybody should make sure to upgrade to 1.0. Absolutely beautiful, very beautiful wallet for the Chrome plugin extension. Takes dark mode. It looks fantastic. Love it. So he released version 1.10, polished SigmaUSD dApp implementation, fixed a ledger connection bug, fixed Firefox compatibility issues. Added semi-automatic release CI, which has built the different targets and release happens in the CI workflow. Publishing in stores is done manually after functional and security tests. Minor UI tweaks. Next up, add internationalization support. That's a big word to save for three cups of peach schnapps.

[47:41] **Armeanio**: All right. Looks like next we have kushti. He's been working on the Ergo protocol and reference client doing some research and development. With Scripto 3.1.0, with Scala 3 support released, along with new version for Scorix, Utils, and D-Box. So Josnia has been on that for PRs working towards that end. So that'd be nice to see Scala 3. Ergo 6.0.0 RC3 has been released. A couple of fixed PRs for 6.0 has merged into the 6.0 branch. He's working on polishing to propose for review. So everybody out there, please take a look. It looks like polishing 6.0.0 PR for the node. It's a proposal for review as well. For sub-blocks, Forks resolution is done and covered with tests, planning the peer-to-peer layer for sub-blocks propagation. So that's another step.

[48:42] **qx()**: And also, people who are running nodes, please, if you're starting up a new node, don't take 6.0, right? Drop down. Those are pre-releases. It's not going to work on the normal node. You have to drop down to 5.2.1 or whatever the latest 5 is kind of thing. So make sure you do that. And also FYI, our community note update. The RocksDB database loves SSDs. Man, that thing is fast, Joe.

[49:12] **qx()**: For some reason, my node on my aero.aep.cornell.edu explorer just chunked out. It toasted. I can't remember why. It's been too long. So I had to rebuild it from scratch and I use the latest RocksDB and holy cow. Nothing is fast. If I go to my SigmaUSD oracle wallet, you know, usually on the old node that took about 15 seconds 20 seconds to load that things loaded in five seconds, because that thing has like 30 40 50 thousand transactions from SigmaUSD oracle but yeah RocksDB if anybody has the time to and they want to redo it to RocksDB. It loves SSDs super fast. It's fantastic.

[49:56] **qx()**: All right, let's see what else we have. kushti says, ChainCash. He's got a paper out. It's done. Will appear on preprint server shortly. Awesome. I'm really excited for ChainCash. ChainCash is like the thing that, no, it feels like - It feels like we're taking power away from the government with this kind of thing. If it goes on, if people actually use it and use it for what it's made, it means that entities and groups can actually mint notes based on their reserves and people can pass them out and actually use them as forms of payment for things that represent the reserve. Like, how cool is that? How cool is that for an entity to be able to mint their own currency? Right. That's flipping awesome. And you may say, well, why don't they just mint a token and sell their token and that kind of thing? This is totally different. This is literally a note that is backed up by a reserve from a treasury of an entity that does it or backed up by anything else. It could be backed up by physical goods at some point, depending if they can figure out a best way to rationalize that on chain. But yeah, super cool, super excited for ChainCash. That's going to be really cool.

[51:15] **qx()**: Joe, your dogs are fine. Don't stress out, buddy. All right, what else we got?

[51:24] **qx()**: I'll go with Dexy since it's still kushti. Dexy, he says deployed UI for Testnet. They've got the XYZ link right there for Ergo-Fi. Please give it a try. On Sigma Rust, Python binding is done by disk and pushed to PyPI. PyPI. I've reviewed and approved another couple of 6.0 PRS by do sec. Great. It looks like you got Kobe Selardoor.

[51:55] **Armeanio**: All right. So it looks good to be back. Good to have you back. Kobe. The Ergo node open API fixed, issue 2199. It's worked on open CI issue 2202, with sigma state getting to know the Merkle trees for sigma script. Like he reviewed one of Joe's next PR node reviews for sigma state and script.

[52:26] **qx()**: Oh, all right. Let's see what else we have.

[52:31] **qx()**: Oh, holy cow, Joe, we've got a Paideia update from Luivatra. I need a sip of peach schnapps after this.

[52:43] **qx()**: All right, Luivatra, we got Paideia fix an issue, breaking display of token amount for some tokens and send funds proposals resulted in and. Man tracking down a bug that happens around start of new staking cycle, causing the stake to be corrupted. A reset of the off chain bot fixes this, but not ideal. So trying to make permanent fix. If anybody has Paideia sitting on the wallet, please, please join the General's Paideia DAO, right? Stake that Paideia, get more Paideia and participate in voting on changes on the overall Paideia DAO. So you're missing an opportunity there if you're sitting on Paideia in your wallet or the crux. Added better error handling on some of the endpoints inspired by tokens being minted with funky registers. I wonder what Luivatra's funky definition is.

[53:37] **qx()**: All right, you got Joseph Mice there.

[53:39] **Armeanio**: All right. All in Beene. I've been putting the final touches to finally close the first version. I've done a great job to significantly improve the front end. Once we have everything tied up, we'll proceed to implement support for other tokens besides the ERG. With Celaut.

[54:06] **qx()**: I'm still working on refining and maturing what I have to take confidence steps forward, although I'm happy with how things are going.

[54:22] **qx()**: Joe, I think we need some meme coins with your dogs. I think we need some dog meme coins.

[54:37] **qx()**: Do your dogs ever sleep, Joe? Do your dogs ever sleep?

[54:48] **qx()**: All right, what else we have here? Let's see. Anything else?

[54:58] **qx()**: We've got some debugging going on, some cross help here. Issues requested for Sigma Rust. We're going to contribute to it and they're prepping for the developer chat tomorrow. Yeah. Cool, that's it for that chat there. You switch back to our double window here. OK, we're switched back.

[55:31] **qx()**: Let's see what else we have for question here we have. No more questions we have. Would be sick to see a Stripe type app for Natalie to plug into this AI-generated games, Mark says. By the way, Mark's developed, for those of you who don't know, Mark's fine-tuned a LLM to, what did he do? He fine-tuned an LLM to respond back with node queries or something like that. I've had too much peach schnapps to really center on exactly what he did. It's been too long, but something like that. So Mark does LLM tuning in his IRL life, in real life life stuff. So he's really diving into that for Ergo.

[56:19] **qx()**: For those who don't know, Mark runs the Sigmanauts mining pool. If you guys are mining and you're mining to anything other than the Sigmanauts pool, consider pointing to the Sigmanauts pool because there's bonus tokens that are there. We also are the only pool that collects storage rent. So there's a lot of extra ERGs in there that come out each week as well as bonus tokens. And there's a really we're on Telegram, big chat in there, super fun to hang out there and chat. So there's no reason why you shouldn't join the Sigmanauts pool there as my plug for the Sigmanauts pool.

[56:53] **qx()**: What did you do with your dogs? Did you strangle them, Joe?

[56:55] **Armeanio**: No, I put the puppy in the box. It's got the little cage, the quiet box, the wire box.

[57:05] **qx()**: Oh, that's funny. It doesn't try to bite the wire.

[57:08] **Armeanio**: No, no, no. It's just like a state of depression.

[57:12] **qx()**: It's like crap. I screwed up.

[57:17] **Armeanio**: Yeah, probably should have started there, to be honest.

[57:20] **qx()**: No, it was cute hearing your pups, Joe. All right, what else? Anything else to chat about? It's 11:05. I'm sure my wife's in bed, so it doesn't matter what time I go to bed at this point.

[57:34] **qx()**: What's new for Rosen Joe? What's on the roadmap after Doge?

[57:38] **Armeanio**: Oh, after Doge. I definitely like to get more focused on the Nervos bridge. I think that if we're going to talk about EVM environments, there's definitely the possibility to go to something like base or ink, get into the exchange sphere, just because there's liquidity there. If we're talking Bitcoin forks, probably Bitcoin Cash. It's a big community and I don't know, generally is a little bit more, I would say aligned with UTXO. That's some good development happening there through time. So let's see.

[58:21] **qx()**: All right. I know there's some, when the Sigmanauts was an ask to use some EF funds to help bolster, there was the Binance pool. Or the I think it was PancakeSwap. I think it was a Binance pull on Pancake or something like that. So I think that I think the EF was like, yeah, we'll put up for a vote and it probably will pass. So expect to possibly see some more liquidity in that pool. So that's super sweet.

[58:51] **qx()**: Oh, Byron asks when the US Ergo meetup Joe, you've got a building.

[58:56] **Armeanio**: I have a place in Colorado Springs. If the community ever wants to have a U.S. meetup. Yeah, I've got keys to.

[59:04] **qx()**: That's pretty central, too. I think that's a good spot for it.

[59:06] **Armeanio**: Yeah, I've got keys to a place in Colorado Springs.

[59:09] **qx()**: We have like a we got to have activity lists of like an Ergo hike where we hike to the summit of some mountain.

[59:15] **Armeanio**: And I mean, it depends on the time of year. There's always stuff to do around Colorado, but it's pretty much downtown, downtown. So it's a good spot.

[59:25] **qx()**: All right. I wonder how many people get out there.

[59:29] **Armeanio**: I don't know. I've always said I have keys. I don't really want to do anything more than that. And I think that's a pretty good contribution. So community gets building.

[59:40] **qx()**: You figure it out.

[59:42] **Armeanio**: Yeah, exactly. I mean, yeah, I got a pretty busy life. I can't really I don't have the bandwidth for that, but I do have a place. So if people want to make that happen, we could definitely do it.

[59:56] **qx()**: Maybe we should talk about it more in the next couple of weeks or months to try to get more people interested.

[60:01] **Armeanio**: I've done my part.

[60:05] **qx()**: You've done your part. You've offered Joe. Yeah, perfect. Well, what else do you have on the back burner besides Rosen? Anything else kicking around?

[60:14] **Armeanio**: Working through the rollup contracts, a lot of potential edge cases to be aware of. So that's something just go slow, do it right. And everything will go kind of downhill from that point in terms of coast. It's like the hardest part of Lithos, probably the humming.

[60:33] **qx()**: I think we can get qx() to come out to Colorado.

[60:37] **Armeanio**: I don't know, maybe if you ask him.

[60:43] **qx()**: So talk more about Lithos. What step are you at? I saw an update the other day.

[60:47] **Armeanio**: At this point, basically refactoring the rollup contracts. At that point, everything from there is kind of downhill. It's just like, let's tweak it. Let's see how it performs. Play around with the LETS token. So we'll actually have kind of a public test net after this next milestone, which would be real cool to see.

[61:16] **qx()**: And there's no, this is not, you know how, well, let's take Rosen for example, right? Everything's written back to the Ergo chain, right? Lithos. So if another chain wants to adopt it, there's no write back to Ergo chain for any of the settlements, right? It'll be purely on their chain if they rewrite it for their chain.

[61:35] **Armeanio**: Yeah, we have the potential to take Lithos across Bitcoin, just proof of work in general. So it is designed to be pretty modular.

[61:49] **qx()**: So for those people watching that aren't familiar with Lithos, in short, it's an ability to kind of solo mine but still pool mine based on chain. So you don't have to join something like Herominers, a single mining pool. You're essentially solo mining, but still collectively you can join a decentralized pool, essentially.

[62:12] **Armeanio**: Yeah, you'll be able to join kind of a special type of mining pool that will allow you as the miner to build blocks and you'll still have the potential to get shares. It's just how that's calculated and done is not a secret.

[62:30] **qx()**: Awesome. Awesome.

[62:32] **Armeanio**: I think somebody's happy. I put the puppy in the box.

[62:36] **qx()**: I think that's a thing. A big thank you. What's this one's name?

[62:41] **Armeanio**: This is Bella.

[62:43] **qx()**: Oh, Bella. Italian. Very nice. What kind of dog?

[62:51] **Armeanio**: Shepherd mix, I guess.

[62:53] **qx()**: Oh, very nice. Would she be able to take your no, your child could take everybody, right? There's no question about that.

[63:00] **Armeanio**: No, she and the shower friends.

[63:03] **qx()**: Oh, that's sweet. That's very sweet. Do they does your child sleep on your bed with you?

[63:10] **Armeanio**: No, usually close up in front of the doors to the house.

[63:13] **qx()**: Really like guard dog?

[63:15] **Armeanio**: Yeah, he's that's kind of their nature.

[63:17] **qx()**: That's amazing.

[63:19] **Armeanio**: Yeah, so he's got the house on lock 24/7.

[63:24] **qx()**: All right, I think let's see how long we've been going on for we've been going for oh an hour and four minutes Joe And rusting just said good night. So if rusting says good night, and we don't have anything else to talk about let me finish this up here

[63:47] **Armeanio**: All right, everybody, thank you for coming. Sorry if the dogs were crazy. I'm watching an 18-month-old puppy, and it's kind of half velociraptor and half crackhead. So I'm doing my best. Productivity has declined for the last day, but I can eat it.

[64:07] **qx()**: I got to make it back to the liquor shelf to put this away, and then got to stumble upstairs. I don't know if I'll make it. My wife might find me on the landing in the morning, Joe.

[64:18] **Armeanio**: Well, Taylor, I said I'm sorry.

[64:20] **qx()**: Thanks, everybody, for watching. It's fun to do these live Dev updates. We'll do them as often as we can get Joe to function at this hour.

[64:30] **Armeanio**: All right. Have a good one, everybody.

[64:32] **qx()**: Ciao.
