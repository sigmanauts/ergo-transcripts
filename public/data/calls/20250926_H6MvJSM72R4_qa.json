      "answer": "Sub-blocks DevNet is progressing well and should be ready for community testing in a few days. There are some issues to fix but not many. Initial support for sub-blocks in mempool and the node's wallet is mostly done, and they're testing by bombing the devnet with transactions.",

      "answer": "Some exchanges like BitGet now automatically show tokens that have sufficient liquidity on Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain pools through AI filters. By providing liquidity on these chains via Rosen Bridge, Ergo could get exposure on major centralized exchanges for free, and potentially get native integration if trading becomes active.",

Every party has an individual risk profile, so the system doesn't fail entirely like in 2008 - some circles could fail during crisis while more conservative actors would survive.",

      "answer": "Reputation would be built based on trading history, which is essentially a summary of transaction history. Since we don't have state control, reputation systems could include incentivized agents to probe and challenge reputations, with on-chain challenges and defenses with deadlines to prevent spam.",
