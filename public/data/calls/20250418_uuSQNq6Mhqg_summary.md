**Date:** April 18, 2025  
**Title:** Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA - April 17th

## Executive Summary

This community call featured significant updates on Palm token's successful multi-chain launch using Rosen Bridge, making it the first official multi-chain token to launch with Rosen technology. Dan Friedman reported that the launch went smoothly with approximately $150,000 in daily volume and strong staking participation, with over 250 million Palm tokens already staked. The call also covered major Ergo ecosystem developments including the announcement of ErgoSummit 2025 in Colorado Springs (October 10-12) and updates on node improvements, mining pool enhancements, and Kraken listing progress.

Key technical developments discussed included kushti's continued work on sub-blocks with a rough protocol now tested between two peers, and the successful full sync of Node 6.0 RC3 with mainnet. The community also explored innovative ideas for gamifying mining to attract the gaming community, with discussions about integrating idle gameplay mechanics with mining rewards.
