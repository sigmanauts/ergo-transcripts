      "question": "What percentage of miner votes is needed to change the number of sub-blocks parameter in Ergo 6.0?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "Just 50%, so it's pretty much like block size or block cost limits. It's an ordinary parameter that miners can change by one sub-block up or down each epoch. So if it's 30 sub-blocks per block on average this epoch and miners want to raise it, then next epoch it would be 31, then 32. It's an absolute change of one sub-block per epoch.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "For Chain Cash, it's fully on-chain. But currently we're working on Basis, which is off-chain cache using trackers. You need parties which track state of debt nodes issued off-chain. It's an open source solution, kind of like BitTorrent where you can connect to different trackers and choose freely. Trust can be minimized through federation like Oracle Pool or Rosen Bridge.",

      "answer": "The plan is to update the bank towards using the new Oracle, but they're compatible - it's just about the ID to be updated. There are some different parameters like delay in Oracle version 1, and the epoch is the same but with delay. For new applications, it's better to use the new oracles.",

A raid lasts 15 minutes where members click the link, like it, and help achieve the targets. We're growing with 20 members now. Only admins can post links to ensure we promote good content, not trash tweets. Members get notifications and real-time updates on progress.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "Yes, I think it's quite easy to sell Ergo to Bitcoin OGs, especially when describing ideas around Chain Cash and how we can realistically separate money from the state - that's the very original idea of Bitcoin. When you talk with real OGs in person, it's quite a different experience than public Bitcoin maximalists. If you're not about separating money from states, then you're not quite a Bitcoin OG.",

You can combine these - like cold wallets with withdrawal limits and whitelisted transfers, creating complex financial machinery as building blocks.",

      "asker": "Grayman",
      "answer": "We need multiple messages targeting developers, miners, and non-technical people. A progressive approach with KPIs - posting a set amount per day consistently. The algorithm rewards consistency with more exposure. We can create memes, controversial tweets (approved first), and push our vision and values. It's about assessing who you're talking to and narrowing your message for different venues.",
