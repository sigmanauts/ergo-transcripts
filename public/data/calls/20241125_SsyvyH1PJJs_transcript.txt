[00:10] **Marc the Shark**: All right, Mark, what's happening, man?

[00:13] **Marc the Shark**: Hey, tim.erg.

[00:14] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, I'm doing pretty well. Beautiful weather out here in Colorado. How about yourself?

[00:19] **tim.erg**: I'm doing well. I've been super busy. Just moved back to New Mexico a little while ago, so still organizing my life. But overall, pretty good, brother.

[00:30] **Marc the Shark**: Nice, nice. Yeah, I'm about to move. I just packed everything up in the pod. About to ship that off here today to Florida. I'm about to be in it.

[00:41] **tim.erg**: Yeah, dude. We got some cool stuff going on around ERG. I see we got a hackathon coming up. You want to talk about that a little bit? I don't actually know that much about it. I haven't had time.

[00:54] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, certainly. So there's the, I think it's the ErgoHack 9. It is on enhancing user experience and user experience innovations and UX. This is really confusing to read, sorry. Enhancing user experience innovations in UI, UX and mining. I think it's because it has user experience in there twice with the UX. It's in any case.

So whether you are UI and UX designer, front end developer, blockchain enthusiast or mining expert, this event offers the chance to collaborate, learn and create. And so yeah, highly, highly recommend, even if it's just like sort of a white paper, putting some ideas on paper. I think it's great to get feedback. It looks like there's a schedule this time to where there's going to be a workshop, several workshops. So workshop on the first day, seems like every day in between, even some Q and A, whereas I don't think that's been the case before. That's great.

[01:58] **tim.erg**: I like the workshop idea. So that's just like how the community is, right? It's like, people just, if someone's willing to work on something and learn, everyone will help you kind of do it.

[02:13] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, totally. I mean, you just got to show the initiative because I mean, I think oftentimes someone would be like, hey, I have this cool idea. Let me hand it off to you. And it's like, dude, people are already working on stuff. So it's like, and maybe you don't have time and that's fine, right? But if you do have time and it is your idea, maybe there needs to be some more pillars, right? To help support you and the community will come in and do that, right? They've done that with me for sure. And then from there, you can kind of have your own support and then kind of go on your own sort of, whatever you're trying to do.

Like me and Tim, I talked to Tim yesterday about creating a dApp. And so yeah, I think the Ergo hacks are great, great opportunity for people to kind of just to figure out the ecosystem to one, be able to ask for help because the whole event is to sort of do development. And so it's a perfect opportunity to be able to ask for help and to get help.

[03:15] **tim.erg**: Yeah, that's cool. And I think UI UX is a really good place for us to invest some time and energy. I'm just imagining some of the dApps are like, the bones are there. It's really cool. But yeah, just to take that next level. I'm just thinking of just the ones I've used the most like DuckPools is like almost there. It's the dApp side into the back end. It's working. And then just like that next little level to make us on par with really the top top chains.

[03:56] **Marc the Shark**: What do they have exactly? Sorry, not to cut you off. But what do they have? Because I always hear that, oh, well, the Ergo dApps, they don't have the user interface or the user experience that we're kind of used to. Like, can you explain what is sort of like the vibe and feel that when people say that, what are we talking about, I guess, in more like words?

[04:18] **tim.erg**: Yeah, sure. So, okay, I will preface this by saying, I think DuckPools is awesome. And I don't mean this to be like any cutting criticism. But so things I've seen before is just like, really clear indication of when I might be liquidated. And just little things like that, or I've seen... 

There was one app called Balancer on Ethereum, and I thought this was really cool. It was like, you could just create your own pool, and it's more than just two coins. So you could set up a whole portfolio. I want 15% this, 20% that, and just build the whole pool. And that will maintain your the proportion of all your positions and then route trades through your pool to help balance that as prices change. Which is sick. And so but just like setting it up was just very, very easy. And I was able to get more information about my positions.

[05:31] **Marc the Shark**: Gotcha. Okay, so kind of like an understanding of like what it's doing, why it's doing it, and then like maybe why you would want to do it. I kind of, I guess less of like clicking buttons, I guess, right?

[05:46] **tim.erg**: Yeah, yeah, just like a polished dashboard. And I felt like I had all the information that I needed to make decisions right away. And I guess I wouldn't say that's true of everything in Ergo, right? Like, SigmaFi, all the info is right there. It's good. I kind of like it.

There's maybe some other things. Sometimes there's a lot of loans that show up in SigmaFi. Being able to kind of filter those might be cool, might be a little bit better, or I'm excited about, what is it, the proposals currently kind of go one direction, so you might make a loan request. I think they're going to implement a lend request as well. Which is interesting and helpful.

[06:43] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah. OK. Yeah. I mean, so that's really good feedback, because I mean, for somebody who does want to do something in the UI UX ErgoHack, right. So now if you're going to design something right, take some of what Tim was saying here and integrate that sort of into your design, because I mean, I think totally right, especially with blockchain needs to be simple, clean, concise.

Doesn't need to have like all this sort of stuff sort of happening, I guess, in the background. And then, but I mean, even I know from making the Sigmanauts mining dashboard, at some point, though, it's like, all right, this is too much. But also, I cannot not have this metric. And so there's got to be a definitely a balance. But I'm glad I'm not really a UI person, because that's a lot.

[07:31] **tim.erg**: Yeah, I think something I keep hearing is we need to get to the point where people don't realize they're using the blockchain. And I think that's probably a great benchmark to hit. It's like, oh, no, I'm just doing banking or I'm just using this application that I need to do my business. Totally. I'm not to feel like a hacker.

[08:03] **Marc the Shark**: Right, and then and that even comes up with like, or comes back to sort of like, okay, so the user interface, what is that? Should that even have like tons of crypto feel? Right? Should have these crypto tokens. And I know some of the Ethereum sort of wallets and stuff. And they got these crazy headers, things are bouncing. It's like a, you're like at a casino kind of a thing. And it's just like, hey, I'm just trying to buy a token or something like that.

So yeah, definitely, again, more you have really good feedback, because I mean, you're totally right, right? Like, if I was going to buy, if somebody was going to legit buy a loan that's backed by a blockchain, or not a loan, or it could be a loan, a loan or insurance, whatever, they want to make sure again, that's trustworthy, it's reputable. And then a lot of this other crypto stuff meme coins and stuff has like sort of a bad connotation to it. So definitely got to be choosy with the audience demographic words verbiage.

[08:59] **tim.erg**: Yeah, and the symbols like I always was kind of taken aback by the food themed everything. Like, I guess like, sushi swap is kind of huge now. And nobody even thinks about it as like a food thing, but then we, now we have SundaeSwap and PancakeSwap on, come on about that.

[09:23] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah. All the toasty swap. I think that's a food, right? Yeah, there's a lot. Yeah. Yeah, totally. So it's like, and that's even kind of going to some of the Ergo, I guess, manifesto and stuff, like in the sense of like, we're trying to be unique. We're trying to do our own thing, trying to pave our own path, I suppose. Yeah.

[09:47] **tim.erg**: I guess something I wanted to bring up and I guess a good point here. It's okay if people just kind of have some fun too. We have a new dApp called MewFinance. Have you seen that?

[10:02] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I bought some cyberverse emotes on it.

[10:06] **tim.erg**: I bought some honey.

[10:09] **Marc the Shark**: Oh, okay. Yeah.

[10:11] **tim.erg**: Yeah, awesome. I bought some honey. So I don't know when that's coming in. But I thought it was a pretty cool. A pretty cool use. Like it was actually really easy. I didn't feel didn't feel janky at all. Yeah, excuse that stuff cooking for sure. Yeah, I just I mean, I just like bought food off the internet from somebody I don't know. So that's like a little bit of a risk. But we'll see. We'll see. I'll give it the smell test.

[10:42] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, yeah, I'm excited to see where this goes. I was talking to qx(), he wants to do sort of like a hash rate system or not hash rate system, a GPU system where we can buy and sell them. And then we can escrow them. And so we'll test them to make sure they're good. And then we're in all those details and stuff. So it's just like, kind of started from like the Sigmanauts swag where that qx() got for Vegas and then now it's like become this and so I'm pretty excited to see like maybe a year from now it becomes like this just diverse on-chain real world asset sort of ecosystem of just like buying and selling stuff and then the mining pool we might get linked up in there and so then we could be like

Oh, that cup of honey or the jar of honey, whatever. I want to mine that. But it takes me two weeks to mine however much you bought it for say, but it'll be like a layaway sort of thing. So I mean, there's just so many different applications to be able to use this sort of thing, especially if shipping is cheaper if you can get around like deport or the taxes. But that's I don't know.

[11:50] **tim.erg**: Yeah, dude, I think it's cool. And something I remember, I think it was a TED talk a while ago, a guy was just like getting into the black market and just like seeing what he could buy several years ago. And one of the things that he learned was that when it's like this open market, reputation is literally everything. And so the quality control that people implement on these open markets is really high, because all they have is the reviews.

And there's not this barrier of entry that protects people. So when I go to Smith's or whatever and I get rotten grapefruits, it's a recent experience. It doesn't matter if I go bitch them out because nobody else is selling grapefruit. But on an open market, your reputation is everything and there is competition because the barrier of entry is very low. Right. So that to me just really vibes with Ergo's whole philosophy and my own.

[13:06] **Marc the Shark**: 100% man. I mean, and now like, if you make if you can have like a little hobby that does something like you make key chains, you can sell those key chains straight out of your house. Now, start to build a brand in some aspects, join the Sigmanauts do it for the Sigmanauts. Like, yeah, man, there's gonna be a lot more grassroots I feel like can maybe happen now. Whereas early on it's like, the idea is cool and it's like nebulous, but how can I help?

And then as we kind of move forward, sort of, it's like a river and it's like slowly growing and then, and then that like is affecting the ability or the applicability of the technology and then usability too, I suppose. And so now it can like affect more people. And so, like you were saying earlier, where it's like, what if someone can buy something on MewFinance, buy it with dollars, switch to ERG, do all that stuff in the back end, not even know they're using the crypto, and then just know that, like, oh, MewFinance is this like peer to peer system, it's got a reputation system, and I'm going to trust it, as opposed to this other stuff. And then, yeah, that's just so cool.

[14:17] **tim.erg**: Yeah. So, another thing kind of taking steps forward is Rosen. Do you see what's going on there?

[14:25] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, right. They've crossed the bridge to Ethereum. I haven't seen any bots pop up on X or anything, so that's been good. But yeah, exciting, right?

[14:38] **tim.erg**: Yeah, yeah. Not a ton of LP over there yet, but I saw like a screenshot of the last, I don't know, 24 hours of volume and like there's ERG is getting picked up on that side and. It's just out of an exciting first little day of activity over there.

[15:00] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah. And I think someone started an Ergo raffle too. So you can afford the liquidity and there's some stuff. So I'm not sure if that's still going on, but definitely check that out.

[15:09] **tim.erg**: Yeah. You can, he'll give you your LP tokens, right? Is that? Yeah, I think so. Something like that. So I really wonder how that's all going to work out because I, I guess as soon as somebody is interacting with both chains, they're just going to realize it is like 1% the cost to operate on Ergo.

Like you could make a position, take it away, do a different one, take it away. But in ETH, you just have to be really sure that what you're doing is correct, because it costs you $17 to do something. And unless you're putting in thousands of dollars, it's not even worth it. Right.

[16:00] **Marc the Shark**: So you think the ecosystem will start to see more Ethereum-related apps? Or I guess it's made on Ergo, but for Ethereum? Do you think those apps will start to be created.

[16:14] **tim.erg**: I didn't get that. Maybe. Maybe. I think either it'll be large positions of ERG on the Ethereum side where the fees are worth it. Or people from ETH are going to be like, oh, this is maybe nice over here. And so I don't know if they would just bring their ETH over or would they pick up ERG? Probably they would want to keep their ETH. I don't know if they would invest in a coin that they didn't fully understand. It's just going to be interesting to see.

[16:54] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, yeah, because I guess like, now what's the incentive? The incentive is now here for Ethereum developers, right? It's like, you don't have to just be an Ergo developer and just to support Ergo. Be an Ethereum developer, come over here, use our TX fees, right? And then do whatever you need to do on our chain and then facilitate it back over to Ethereum. Or just keep it in Ergo because you can have the RSV asset and so I they've been pumping out a lot of those so and I'm not really too keen on I guess the Ethereum ecosystem but it would be an interesting sort of idea to kind of

even for like a hackathon to sort of attach on sort of dApps for other chains, but they're on Ergo, I mean, similar to Rosen Bridge, I guess, but to save in those fees. So and then be able to swap back or whatever the case.

[17:46] **tim.erg**: Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how people use it. I I'm also interested in like, how are the other tokens, like you mentioned all the tokens from ADA, like SundaeSwap tokens are now on Ethereum. What are the consequences of that going to be? Who knows?

[18:08] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, yeah, now those tokens are susceptible to like all the bullshit in terms of like, or not bullshit, but just like, potentially getting locked on Ethereum, right? Or like stolen on Ethereum or, whatever people, like we were just talking about people developing stuff. Well, all that is still, all that stuff that has happened to Ethereum is still maybe gonna be applied and now maybe new attack vectors for specific tokens are now open, right? Because they're on, I mean, arbitrage, right? That's a new thing because now we have all this, and it's almost like an oracle in and of its own sense, right? Because the oracle rate isn't just catching up fast enough because people aren't exchanging, buying and selling on these individual sort of island of tokens and stuff.

So it's going to be interesting to watch the landscape kind of is it a weevil wobble tilting towards one maybe crypto, hopefully Ergo, right? Or is it gonna be balanced or is it, how's it gonna look, right?

[19:12] **tim.erg**: Yeah. How interesting. I'm excited for the rest of the crypto sphere to get connected. They're talking about Binance chain. Yeah. I don't know much about Sui, but I saw that come up. I'm really interested to see Monero get connected. They're waiting on a major update that's happening there. And then that might be a priority. Yeah, that would be sweet.

[19:46] **Marc the Shark**: What do you like in terms of privacy that Monero, I think we talked about it a little bit before, but what do you like about Monero specifically that maybe Ergo doesn't have?

[19:57] **tim.erg**: I think that it's necessary to have an option that is, so privacy is optional on Ergo. And I think that's probably the most widely usable way, I guess. How do I say? If you're building something for everyone, privacy should be optional, not mandatory, but I think everyone should have a choice to use Monero because it's like 100% private by design, like in the core protocol. And I don't want to say 100% private because nothing's 100% private, but that level of privacy is just there, and it's simple for people.

Whereas for us, it's like, oh, we have to download the front end for the mixer and do these steps. There's a little bit of a barrier. And people might not prefer that. And I think if you could just, oh, I'll just bridge to Monero and then make a transaction and then bridge back to a new wallet. mixed.

[21:14] **Marc the Shark**: Okay, I see what you're saying. So you're suggesting maybe taking your funds, bridging them to Monero, then do the whole privacy and then maybe bridge back again from Rosen Bridge, but then to a new Ergo wallet and then go from there, right?

[21:30] **tim.erg**: Maybe. Yeah, yeah, that's something that could happen. And it could also happen the other way where Monero is like, oh, I have all this Monero and I want to borrow against my Monero. and accessed proper DeFi, that's not quite possible there on Monero.

[21:51] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, no, that's a great point. And then like to that point, right, if you think about the total crypto market cap, right, from a loan perspective, it's like we've got all this money to loan out. Because people are probably just sitting on their bags and stuff. And so using DeFi and Ergo as that sort of ability, like you're saying, DuckPools is awesome. I love DuckPools, participated in the IDEO yesterday.

But yeah, having that capability and, again, going back to trustworthiness, it's like, okay, yeah, I'll give out some of my ERGs to loan out or whatever the case, SigmaUSD when that was popping. We were looking at a thing this last weekend, man, it was like 40% or 20%. That's crazy. It's dropped a lot.

[22:36] **tim.erg**: Yeah. Oh, man, it was really high for a while. It was like, 60s, like 70% like it was it was high. It was 120% at one point. Yeah, dude.

[22:53] **Marc the Shark**: It's 2.5 right now.

[22:57] **tim.erg**: Interesting how interesting you would think people would be like going long now.

[23:03] **Marc the Shark**: Right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's kind of weird for sure. Maybe they all got wiped out. Yeah, right. Nobody else has any funds. That's why it's just stayed around like 65 cents, 70 cents. Yeah. Yeah. I was just waiting for Bitcoin to carry the way it carry us through. Right. The wave.

[23:21] **tim.erg**: Yeah. All right. So hey, I had a couple other things for us to talk about. So something that I came across when I first joined Ergo was called Metal Saturdays. And I just thought this is so cool. Have you seen Metal Saturdays?

[23:40] **Marc the Shark**: No, I haven't.

[23:42] **tim.erg**: I saw kushti say, hey, can I get proof of metal? And so everybody started just sharing their YouTube links for their favorite metal songs or just whatever they were jamming that day. And it's kind of every Saturday. I say Saturday, but it's like a UTC type of thing. So like, I don't know if it's Friday or Saturday. And every week I probably, you probably see like 20 or so links to, I don't know, just somebody's Lamb of God or, whatever they got going on.

[24:22] **Marc the Shark**: What channel is that happening in?

[24:24] **tim.erg**: Just the main one, just the main one. It's every now and then somebody will start it off. There's a guy named MX, you know MX. No, he's one of the OGs. He's, I think he's kind of the anchor and kushti as well. And then we'll see, cafe and all the people who've been here for a long time and like throwing their stuff in. I just thought it was cool. Like when I first started in crypto.

everyone was serious. Not serious, but it's about this thing. And then I just got to see actual culture emerge from this thing. And it's like, oh, these are humans. These are humans. And they like to rock.

[25:08] **Marc the Shark**: Do you like something else that I like? Oh, that's awesome. Yeah.

[25:11] **tim.erg**: Totally. Yeah.

[25:13] **Marc the Shark**: I'm not a big fan of metal, I would say. But I will listen to it. I'm a big fan of reggae. Oh, yeah. like 311. I'm like blanking at all the bands right now. Revolution, Irish.

[25:30] **tim.erg**: Cool, man. Yeah, yeah. I would say I'm not like a metal fan either. Like, there's a time and a place.

[25:36] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we can start a reggae Sundays. Yeah, any case, that'd be funny.

[25:45] **tim.erg**: So that kind of inspired me to start something a while ago. I don't know how long it's been. But so I started a channel called the Ergo Fight Club. And it's not terribly popular. But so every every Saturday or like every other Saturday, any Saturday that there's a fight, there's a group of maybe there's probably like eight of us that we just hop on the chat anytime there's a UFC event or like maybe a headline boxing match or something. We got the tipper bot in there. So we're, betting one ERG here and there on who it is.

And I think this next big event, I think in November, we're going to do like a parlay, like, you're going to pick, we're going to pick the whole card. the outcome and whoever has the most correct guesses is gonna take the pot.

[26:44] **Marc the Shark**: There you go. That sounds like fun. Well, yeah. Where can people find out about that? Cause I know they have like that big list of like all the groups, but I don't think I've, I don't think I'm in there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You should get that out and talk to Glasgow or something.

[26:58] **tim.erg**: I will. I will. Yeah. Every now and then I'll put it out on, on Twitter just to like, see if anyone wants to join, or in the main one. But every time we do it on Twitter, you would pick up like seven bots and then have to just remove it.

[27:10] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, that's how it goes, I guess. Yeah, I put it in the main because Ergo platform one.

[27:17] **tim.erg**: Yeah. But yeah, so that was me just trying to contribute after seeing like, Metal Saturdays, like people just doing the thing that they like. And then turns out there's a bunch of people that enjoy the fights too. So yeah, so crazy thing happened actually. So got to talking with one of the guys there. And I won't say who it is just for privacy. Turns out that me and him trained at the same gym in like 2011. Like we were definitely training at the same gym at the same time in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

[27:51] **Marc the Shark**: Oh, wow.

[27:53] **tim.erg**: And like, that's as far as it went. We didn't see each other. We don't live in the same state. And it was just like, oh, I was there. I trained there for three years. I was like, oh, yeah, me too.

[28:06] **Marc the Shark**: And like, that's as far as it went, you know, we didn't like, did you guys recognize each other after like, you saw each other again, or?

[28:19] **Marc the Shark**: That's so funny. Yeah, it's funny how that all works. That's hilarious. Small world. Yeah, absolutely. You're like, oh, I can't remember if I kicked your butt or not, but I definitely did. No. That's awesome. No, that's super sick. Have you talked to CannonQ about some of this? Because he's developing a dApp called The Field. And then you'll be able to do the parlay stuff on chain.

[28:47] **tim.erg**: and bedding and stuff. I'm super excited. So I really, I was really disappointed when Night Owl casino didn't pan out. And I saw Jay around actually recently, but I didn't bring anything up, but I was super disappointed because I wanted the sports betting. Like that's a killer dApp. and I'm really glad that CannonQ picked it up and just looking forward to it. Tipper bot's cool. Sorry, Lou. But this will be better.

[29:24] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, for sure. So how do you guys do the tipper bot? You just say, hey, I'll take this bet. Someone's like, all right, agreed. And then whoever wins or loses, wins or loses. Then you're like, all right, tip it out, one ERG or whatever.

[29:35] **tim.erg**: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We just keep it small. That way it's never like, you know.

[29:40] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. No, that's a lot of things. That's a lot of fun. I mean, especially to like if you had, like with CannonQ's app, like get something integrated to where you can just put, connect to your credit card, translate some ERGs, and then again, going back to you're not even know this user's crypto.

[30:03] **tim.erg**: Yeah, that'll be cool. So I was thinking, it's on the topic of culture and principles. Some of the apps that I've seen, I just thought it was so cool when I first was exploring Ergo. It was like the Ergo Lend or EXLE. And they've kind of set up this, I guess, relationship. They've built a relationship with people in Kenya, just kind of regularly take out some 0% loans and they pay it back and then they take another one and they pay.

I mean, to me that just really underscores the power of what this is capable of doing. And I'm excited to see it grow. I don't know anyone in Kenya, but one of the guys that's around for a long time, his name is Riro. Do you know Riro?

[31:08] **Marc the Shark**: I've heard the name.

[31:10] **tim.erg**: Yeah, he's he's in Mumbai. And just like, nice guy in Mumbai just sends pictures of like, what he's making for dinner or whatever. And it's cool. It's like, this is benefit him or people like him. Totally see an actual change.

[31:30] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, yeah, for sure. Finance and kind of benefiting us and more of a like you're saying cultural ecosystems kind of raise everybody up by the bootstraps rather than just like a select few.

[31:43] **tim.erg**: Yeah, yeah. And then that that kind of gives gets into like the local exchange trading system. Have you come across that yet?

[31:54] **Marc the Shark**: Okay, no, I haven't heard of that one then.

[31:59] **tim.erg**: So LETS is like a circular economy. So it will kind of be a dApp. And it's kind of like ChainCash maybe. I think ChainCash is maybe more of an open ecosystem where you can have something as collateral and then you can lend your token or send your token backed by that. And then you can always somebody can always redeem the token for the collateral. And ChainCash also has this aspect where like the next person can have collateral. And so the tokens are actually backed by everyone's collateral eventually. Okay.

And that I think has like, bigger implications like a country or a state might like, I have all this oil and I want to issue a coin against it. So people can interact. But LETS is more like small. So let's say if you had like, I don't know, just like a little village or something and you needed a system for accounting, that's it, right? It's like, here's the tokens. They could have it be backed by something. And it's just like, for them to monitor. And it's actually an old idea, local exchange trading system, it's been done a bunch of times.

But now it's like, with this technology, and, you bring up all the other stuff, NIPoPoWs, and whatever. It's like, yeah, anyone can do this. Like you just need like a tiny bit of internet and you're good to go.

[33:35] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, that's pretty powerful. I think I did see LETS on like, one of the EIPs. They were talking about like, some dApps and like suitable ways to like mock them up. But yeah, I mean, again, bringing real world, applications is going to be huge and where blockchains really shows its strength are these applications to where you can loan out somebody on a good faith loan. Yeah here Don't worry about any of the interest but know that you're going to get paid back There is collateral collected within the blockchain. So if they don't pay you back, that sucks, but there are things kind of in place to kind of facilitate that And be able to kind of

you know, I guess in a sense, siphon some of our wealth off into these other places. And then again, just start to bolster up these other economies. That'd be cool to see. Yeah, man. Probably be some years before it's all like out the wild, but yeah, probably more dApps, easier to use, like you were saying, from a real world, I'm curious how they would actually use it though in Africa. Right.

And then like connected to all on chain, and then like how many computers did they have access to? And then like, so what sort of dApp would be even optimal to facilitate that? And then, of course, replicating it and stuff. Yeah, I think probably are, yeah, indeed, some time away just because I think we're still igleys and Ergo's kind of facilitating the, I think that we have dApps right but I think we're on the verge of just like explosive dApps and sense of like, we have a lot of them, or they have a lot of punch not the not to say that the ones don't now but.

I think we're attracting more people to the ecosystem, especially with the Ergo hacks and things like that. And so hopefully we'll start to see more and more of these types of applications. I know with the good things that qx(), wants to do more lending and do things like that. So that'll be really neat. I wonder what he's doing with that. We'll have to ask him next time he's on. Yeah.

[35:52] **tim.erg**: Yeah. So anyways, that's my list of topics for today. You have anything else you want to chat about?

[35:59] **Marc the Shark**: I don't know. That's all good on my end. I need to get back to it. The boxes are calling. Not the UTXO boxes.

[36:09] **tim.erg**: Best of luck with that, man. Drive safe and don't let your cat cause an accident.

[36:15] **Marc the Shark**: Absolutely. All right. Take care. See you everybody.
