# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** September 14, 2025 (Call Title references September 11th)

## Executive Summary

The second weekly Ergo Community AMA brought together core developers and community members to discuss accessibility challenges, development updates, and community growth strategies. The conversation centered heavily on the friction new users face when trying to participate in the Ergo ecosystem, with community member Ben highlighting the complexity of simple tasks like donating to Ergo raffles. The discussion evolved into practical solutions including fiat on-ramps, educational outreach to non-crypto communities, and improving user experience through projects like GitCircles.

Development progress was shared across multiple fronts, including Node 6.0 improvements, sub-blocks testing with extreme DevNet parameters (30-second blocks with 60 sub-blocks each), and updates to various ecosystem projects like Nautilus wallet, Machina Finance, and anti-spam measures. The community also discussed marketing strategies focused on reaching ordinary people seeking decentralized money rather than typical crypto influencers.

## Key Discussion Points

• **User Accessibility Crisis**: Ben's experience highlighted the multi-step complexity of participating in Ergo ecosystem (Coinbase → KuCoin → wallet → raffle), leading to discussion of Apple Pay integration and fiat on-ramps
• **Sub-blocks Development**: Intensive testing on DevNet with 2 sub-blocks per second, revealing synchronization issues across geographic distances
• **GitCircles Project**: New community currency system for developer communities, targeting Rust frameworks and planning airdrops to existing developer bases
• **Marketing Strategy Pivot**: Discussion shifted from crypto influencers (who demand high payments) to targeting travel bloggers and ordinary users seeking borderless money
• **Rosen Bridge Integration**: Explored cross-chain raffle participation allowing Bitcoin/Ethereum users to contribute via bridge liquidity
• **Anti-Spam Measures**: Community-driven approach to mark scam tokens and addresses, with Nautilus wallet implementing automated protection
• **Autolykos DAO**: Grayman promoted the venture capital collective's upcoming "Sow Round" and payment gateway development

## Decisions Made

• QX committed to testing dual fiat/ERG fundraising (GoFundMe + Ergo raffle) for future Sigmanauts events
• Community will continue developing spam token/address blacklists for Nautilus wallet integration  
• Infrastructure machines ready for shipment to increase P2P network
• Plans to migrate ergoplatform.org hosting from Google to community infrastructure to reduce EF costs

**kushti**: "The idea is to avoid [crypto KOLs] at all and, yeah, attach to like ordinary people. Because, well, we cannot fight, right, with so-called crypto. We can just build some alternative or original, actually, vision, right?" - On marketing strategy philosophy
