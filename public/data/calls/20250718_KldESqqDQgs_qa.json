      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "There is 90+ percent support for Ergo 6.0, so we will see activation around October. After that we can think about sub-blocks. We'll try public testnet first and then consider mainnet activation timeframe.",

      "answer": "There is a need to explain how sub-blocks are designed and implemented in more detail. We will do this in coming weeks, maybe with some videos. The main benefit is for DEXes and applications that are completely virtual - you can do operations in like two seconds instead of two minutes.",

      "asker": "Alex T",
      "answer": "The idea is to have a double merge mined sidechain with design like Ergo. Bitcoin miners work on Bitcoin mining along with Bitcoin merged blocks, while Ergo miners work on Ergo mining along with Ergo merged blocks on that sidechain. Every block is proof-of-work backed and state from both blockchains are brought to the sidechain for use in DeFi.",

      "asker": "Richie",
      "answer": "Bitcoin miners work on Bitcoin mining along with Bitcoin merged blocks, while Ergo miners work on Ergo mining along with Ergo merged blocks on that sidechain. They just need to read data from other blocks to refer to them. It's not a single hash calculation - each blockchain uses its own mining algorithm.",

      "asker": "Hermes",
      "answer": "Lithos is a decentralized mining protocol - it's kind of a decentralized pool which is backed by contracts on Ergo blockchain. It's done efficiently in a rollup-like way. Instead of reporting to a local server on a pool, individual miners put their effort proof on chain itself.",

      "asker": "community member",
      "answer": "There will be some library available to easily build merge mined sidechains. The question is also how to make miners and mining pools pick them easily. We will create easy tools for mining pools - it should be like a UI where they just pick chains they like and mine them.",
