      "answer": "Yes, the implementation of Gluon on Ergo was independently audited by Krasavice Blazen and no further vulnerabilities were found. The audit included not only inspection of the code, but also a simulation of the protocol itself.",

      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "The new frontend has no dependency on a backend anymore making it more decentralized, provides more transparency in fee calculations, displays the protocol's state including reserve ratio and total value locked, and features a more familiar swap-style UI/UX that users had been requesting.",
