# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary - June 5th, 2025

## Executive Summary

The weekly Ergo community call covered significant technical progress with the release of Sigma 6.0 RC6, potentially the final release candidate before the official launch. Kushti announced upcoming conference appearances in Dubai (July) and Korean Blockchain Week (September), while also discussing the integration of new chains like Kaspa and Tari into the Rosen Bridge ecosystem. The call featured extensive discussion about real-world blockchain applications, particularly Dan's Palm Economy work with cocoa and pineapple supply chains in Africa, highlighting the potential for Ergo's technology to address market inequities through transparency and traceability.

The community also announced details for the Ergo Meetup 2025 in Colorado (October 11th), featuring an innovative "AI Devs vs. Old Timer Devs" hackathon competition. Additionally, the Ergo Foundation launched a raffle for Banxa integration, providing direct on-ramp access for purchasing ERG with fiat currency in most regions. Technical discussions included the future applications of ChainCash and Dexy stablecoins, with particular focus on hybrid physical-digital asset backing for commodities like lithium.

## Notable Quotes

**kushti**: "It would be interesting to get into some high-level definition of financial contracts using templates, contract templates we have in Ergo. AI, so probably then not so much, you know, freedom for AI to get here into its hallucination, so it would be quite interesting."

**Dan (SPEAKER_02)**: "You know, we have to kind of stop with this feeling of entitlement. You know, nobody owes us anything. You know, we owe it to ourselves. We owe it to ourselves to use technology to build stuff... If you think that this blockchain is so good, and it is, Ergo is that good, build on Ergo."

**qx()**: "The interfacing with Ergo platform, kushti, when I use AI to code, or even when I don't, it's the easy part. It's insane how easy it is to interface with the tooling and the blockchain, the node, the explorer, all the API endpoints. So easy. The hard part is the actual app itself."
