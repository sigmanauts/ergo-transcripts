# Ergo Community Call Summary - July 31st, 2025

## Executive Summary

The July 31st, 2025 Ergo community call covered significant progress across multiple development fronts, with particular emphasis on upcoming infrastructure improvements and ecosystem expansion. Key highlights included updates on the SigmaLock platform approaching final testing, substantial progress on sub-blocks and merge-mined sidechains development, and the successful conclusion of ErgoHack with budget planning for continued development support.

The community demonstrated strong collaborative momentum with several innovative projects in development, including HQ's multi-chain messaging system connecting Ergo with other UTXO chains, the formation of the InfraDAO using Paideia governance, and various initiatives to improve user onboarding through tutorial creation and fiat on-ramps via Banxa integration.

## Key Discussion Points

• **SigmaLock Platform**: Ready for testing phase with domain at sigmanauts.com, featuring official code review by kushti funded through DAO vote (70,000 Mew tokens)

• **Sub-blocks & Merge Mining**: White paper development underway, API methods being added, with plans for Rust-based merge-mined sidechains to provide additional security budget for miners

• **ErgoHack Completion**: Event concluded successfully with winner announcements, EF focusing on budget optimization and editorial content expansion

• **Wallet Updates**: Minotaur 3.0.1 released for desktop and Android with Multi-Sig improvements; Nautilus wallet integrating Banxa fiat on-ramp

• **Multi-chain Messaging**: HQ developing cross-chain communication system allowing users on different chains (Ergo, Alephium) to interact while staying on their native chains

• **InfraDAO Formation**: Vote passed for 50,000 Paideia tokens to establish official InfraDAO on Paideia platform for community infrastructure management

• **Tutorial Incentives**: kushti offering 20K Mew bounties for creating guides on MewFinance, MewPhysicals, and related services

## Decisions Made

• SigmaLock contracts will undergo official review by kushti using purchased development time
• InfraDAO will be established on Paideia with initial 4-5 founding members before broader community invitation
• Tutorial bounty program launched with 20K Mew rewards for educational content creation
• Multi-chain messaging system development to proceed with Ergo-Alephium integration first

## Notable Quotes

**kushti on ecosystem development**: "We need to do as much as possible positive circulation of different monetary value of ERGs and tokens in the ecosystem... the more circulation, the more velocity, the more services being created and sold along with condenser and so on, the better for the ecosystem."

**kushti on merge mining benefits**: "If you want to do some blockchain experimentation, then you are getting liquidity, hash rate, and yeah, Ergo miners are getting some additional rewards. Well, for liquidity traders and so on to unlock more ERGs in DeFi."

**HQ on cross-chain communication goals**: "The main idea here is to somehow find a way to communicate with other people, with real people, real users outside of Ergo, to bring them to Ergo and showcase them the DeFi they have on Ergo."
