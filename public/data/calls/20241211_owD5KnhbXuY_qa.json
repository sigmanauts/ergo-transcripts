      "question": "What problems does On-Ergo aim to solve in the blockchain ecosystem?",
      "asker": "Implied from presentation",
      "answer": "On-Ergo addresses the problem of information overload that happens as blockchain ecosystems grow, similar to what occurred with Cardano where it became impossible to stay updated on developments. It also tackles the complexity barrier that prevents most crypto investors from withdrawing coins from centralized exchanges due to the complicated nature of on-chain interactions. The platform provides a clear, consistent guide for navigating the ecosystem and encourages newcomers who are scared to make mistakes with their money.",

      "asker": "Implied from presentation",
      "answer": "On-Ergo provides four main components: an event calendar for tracking community meetups, dApp launches, and updates; an educational platform with gamified learning quests; a Discord bot that acts as a community assistant; and incentive systems including leaderboards, raffles, and rewards to encourage ecosystem participation. The platform aims to be a comprehensive hub for both new and experienced users.",

      "asker": "Implied from presentation",
      "answer": "The team is still polishing the details for event posting permissions but wants to make the rules as decentralized as possible. Potential solutions include Discord bot integration or using NFTs to grant posting privileges. They're also considering integrating the Discord bot into Ergo ecosystem Discord servers to follow announcement pages, run posts through AI checks, and automatically add mentioned events to the On-Ergo calendar.",

      "question": "How does the educational quest system work on On-Ergo?",
      "asker": "Implied from presentation",
      "answer": "The educational platform features a gamified quest roadmap where each quest is a learning opportunity that unlocks sequentially. For example, the first quest might be creating a wallet, followed by sending a first transaction or integrating with an app. Each completed quest brings rewards, so users are learning while playing a game and earning along the way. The goal is to build confidence and knowledge, guiding users from newbie to Sigmanauts step by step.",

      "question": "What is the development roadmap for On-Ergo?",
      "asker": "Implied from presentation",
      "answer": "On-Ergo will start with the essentials - the event calendar and Discord bot to establish the foundation. Then they'll expand with more educational quests, enhanced incentives, and user-driven updates. The team plans to open source the project later so the community can contribute directly. The roadmap is designed to be flexible, adapting and improving based on community growth and feedback.",
