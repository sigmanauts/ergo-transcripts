# P2Podcast Episode 5 - Ergo Community Call Summary

**Date:** December 16, 2024  
**Call Type:** P2Podcast Episode 5

## Executive Summary

This episode focused heavily on the current Bitcoin bull market momentum, with Bitcoin approaching $100K and the positive crypto sentiment under the incoming administration. The hosts discussed how this bull run might benefit Ergo, analyzing market cap versus price performance and noting that while Ergo's price appears low compared to all-time highs, the market cap ratio is more favorable due to reduced emissions.

The conversation covered several active Ergo ecosystem developments, including ErgoHack 9 (focused on UI and mining themes), promising projects like the Minotaur multi-sig wallet, and innovative visualization tools like 3D Ergo block explorer. Marc the Shark presented his ErgoHack submission, the Miner Rights Protocol (MRP), which creates a novel token distribution mechanism tied to mining activities.

## Notable Quotes

> "If you look at the price, it looks bad, like per coin, right? But if you look at the market cap, it's not as bad. So market cap, we're one eighth of the way. So we're at a hundred million right now. And all time high was at like 800 million." - **tmr.erg** on Ergo's current market position

> "I think it's a good indicator in some sense of like, you know, the ethos of the community that we haven't had a hard fork for like Ergo Classic or some shit like that, because it's like, you know, we are true to our values." - **Marc the Shark** on Ergo's community cohesion

> "When you kind of get married to a bag, you get in some blind spots. And I was trying to be a little bit funny with some of these. But also, I don't know, maybe illuminate some of these things like Litecoin." - **tmr.erg** on the importance of objective project evaluation
