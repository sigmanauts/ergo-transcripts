# Ergo Community Call Summary - October 2nd, 2025

## Executive Summary

This community call covered significant technical progress across multiple Ergo projects, with major updates on the USC stablecoin, Git Circles development, and the upcoming Node 6.0 activation. The discussion highlighted Ergo's evolution from a foundation-led project to a truly community-driven ecosystem, with emphasis on decentralizing development and governance. The community is preparing for an in-person meetup in Colorado Springs, demonstrating growing real-world engagement. A key theme was leveraging AI agents for development and testing, showing Ergo's embrace of cutting-edge development practices.

The call also addressed governance transparency questions and explored ideas for enhancing community participation through mining DAOs and improved social media presence. With Node 6.0 activating in just five days and emission rewards dropping to single digits, the timing reflects Ergo's maturation as a blockchain platform ready for increased adoption and commercial applications.

## Key Discussion Points

• **USC Stablecoin Progress**: Oracle pool version 2 launched with 12 oracles running, launch parameters being discussed for the bank and LP components
• **Node 6.0 Activation**: Scheduled to activate in approximately 5 days (3,000-3,500 blocks), representing a major protocol upgrade
• **Git Circles Development**: Making good progress toward initial testing phase this month, focusing on digital financial circles for open source development communities
• **AI Integration**: Kushti demonstrated using AI agents (Cursor + DeepSeek) for rapid prototyping and testing, with specific rules to limit AI to testing code only
• **Basis Chain Cash**: Month scheduled for demos and wallet development, with two-phase approach for community trading and agent/robot solutions
• **Monero Bridge Research**: Ongoing exploration of bridging possibilities despite technical challenges with data storage limitations
• **Foundation Evolution**: Discussion of EF's transition from bootstrap entity to community-driven governance, with plans for commercial entity development
• **Mining DAO Proposal**: HQ suggested creating mining DAO for chain governance votes using Paideia platform
• **Colorado Meetup Preparations**: Equipment and streaming setup being finalized for in-person community event

## Decisions Made

• AI agents will be limited to testing code only, with security-critical main code remaining human-developed and reviewed
• Need to improve Twitter/X strategy and content frequency, considering automated posting from Telegram discussions
• Plan to invite Palmyra team (Sam/Dan) to future calls for clarity on collaboration status
• Explore expanding SIGS mining DAO to include all pool operators for governance participation
• Work with Glasgow to restart weekly summaries and extract social media content from community discussions

## Notable Quotes

**Kushti on AI Development**: "So yeah, well, it's understandable why trolls are going mad. So now it's quite easy to get code concepts, right? Even without coding skills, kind of."

**Kushti on Ergo's Evolution**: "So it's the time for that is over. And he actually over like a couple of years ago. I think so. Now it's time to to grow in all the directions."

**qx() on Foundation Transition**: "So eventually. Hopefully, I think at some point they spoke about the EF being some sort of research wing or something like that. But even at this point, I don't know what the possibilities are considering kushti's offshot is developer DAO, which could turn into research and development as well."
