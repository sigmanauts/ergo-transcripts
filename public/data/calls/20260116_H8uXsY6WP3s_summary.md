# Ergo Community Call: AI & Vibe Coding

## Executive Summary

This community call focused on "vibe coding" (AI-assisted development) within the Ergo ecosystem, showcasing various applications built using AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT. Participants demonstrated unstoppable dApps, discussed AI's impact on blockchain development accessibility, and explored how AI is being integrated into Ergo's development workflow.

## Key Topics Discussed

• **Unstoppable dApps on IPFS** - QX demonstrated self-contained HTML applications for reporting, messaging, and social media hosted on IPFS
• **Mobile dApp development** - HQ showcased Android mobile wallet integration and VoltPay frontend development
• **NFT marketplace enhancements** - New bulk buying/selling features and drag-and-drop functionality for MewMart
• **AI-assisted smart contract auditing** - Using LLMs to verify ErgoScript contracts and identify common security vulnerabilities
• **Testing automation** - Generating test cases and mutation testing for Ergo node and Sigma interpreter
• **Mining pool interface conversion** - Converting server-based applications to serverless IPFS-hosted versions using AI
• **Developer onboarding challenges** - Managing increased volume of AI-generated pull requests and maintaining code quality
• **Voice cloning for educational content** - Potential use of AI voice synthesis for Deco tutorials and multilingual content

## Notable Announcements or Decisions

• **New developers joining** - Michael and CannonQ mentioned as new vibe-coding contributors to the ecosystem
• **Upcoming community call** - Next Thursday will feature a ChainCash and Basis-focused spaces discussion with kushti and Fitz
• **Core repository AI policies** - Node and interpreter repositories now include agents.md files restricting AI use to testing code only
• **Sigma book project** - x10zyn is creating a comprehensive book on ErgoScript internals using AI analysis of repositories

## Technical Concepts Explained

• **NIPoPoWs integration** - Using Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work for lightweight blockchain interaction in unstoppable apps
• **UTXO smart contract auditing** - Common ErgoScript vulnerabilities including register correspondence checks and double-spending prevention
• **IPFS application deployment** - Creating self-contained HTML applications with embedded transaction building capabilities
• **Mobile wallet dApp integration** - URL-based dApp loading within mobile wallets without requiring separate APK downloads

## Action Items or Follow-ups

• **Developer template creation** - HQ proposed creating GitHub templates with multiple frameworks (HTML, SVELTE, Node.js) for easier AI-assisted development
• **AI-focused hackathon planning** - Discussion of organizing a small hackathon with existing framework templates and modest prizes
• **Ergo book revival** - kushti committed to reaching out to Joe, Grayman, and Martin to resume work on the Ergo book project
• **Pull request review backlog** - Ongoing need to review approximately 100 AI-generated pull requests across repositories
