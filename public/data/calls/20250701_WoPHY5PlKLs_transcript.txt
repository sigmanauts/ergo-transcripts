[00:13] **Mick**: What's up, everybody?

[00:14] **Mick**: This is Mick from BlitzTCG.

[00:16] **Mick**: It's been a little while since we've had any sort of a real update from Blitz.

[00:21] **Mick**: First, I want to say pretty much all my fault.

[00:25] **Mick**: My life has been quite busy, and to demonstrate that fact, I thought I'd start with something I know pretty much no other update's going to give you, and that is a look at my life and what I've been up to for the past four to six months.

[00:40] **Mick**: Where do I start?

[00:42] **Mick**: I moved back in November. I changed jobs back in November. I'm getting married so that's a thing. I started building this horse pasture, putting in these posts by hand - some of my 225 posts. I built this horse shed.

[01:05] **Mick**: This is sort of like a work-in-progress picture. Let's see if we can find a newer one, or I guess a more completed one.

[01:12] **Mick**: Here's a more completed one.

[01:14] **Mick**: Here's the horses themselves.

[01:17] **Mick**: So needless to say, I've been quite busy.

[01:20] **Mick**: Funds have been quite lacking, as you might imagine, just given the state of the world, number one, the state of crypto, number two, and Blitz is of course a project that requires funding to complete, primarily because I am not talented enough by myself to do the very many things that need to be done to make the game successful, and of course to highlight that here, any of you are welcome to sort of peruse the many people that have helped bring Blitz to where it is today.

[01:52] **Mick**: That all is to say though, at the end of the day, Blitz is still a passion project for me, still near and dear to my heart.

[02:00] **Mick**: I still hope to complete it in totality sometime in the near future.

[02:04] **Mick**: It is slow going, of course you all will know that from those of you who are still following along.

[02:12] **Mick**: But I do keep it up to date security-wise. Everything's still working on the integrations, APIs, the back end, so on and so forth. We're all still working as you would expect.

[02:22] **Mick**: There have been some minor updates here and there. In fact, development was pretty much continuing up until, I want to say, April.

[02:31] **Mick**: And then I had to pause again due to some funding issues where I think about - I don't want to overstate, but maybe about halfway into completing all the abilities necessary for Blitz.

[02:44] **Mick**: So that's a positive.

[02:46] **Mick**: And then the game itself, as many of you know, is already downloadable, technically playable, but you of course know if you have played it, it's not in a great state right now just because everything isn't done.

[03:00] **Mick**: So you can still log in, and I actually added some animations. Animations are freaking expensive, by the way, for any of you who are curious about how much hand-drawn animations are.

[03:11] **Mick**: They're a lot.

[03:13] **Mick**: The metrics screen is up there. I updated some buttons to take you to the website and stuff.

[03:19] **Mick**: Deck Builder still works. I think I made some updates to this to make it a little bit more snappy and also a little bit more accurate for the cards you actually own versus those that you don't.

[03:30] **Mick**: So you can see I own one of those.

[03:32] **Mick**: I fixed all the hover to discover options at one point or another. So basically you can hover over each of these different things and it'll tell you what they mean because there's a lot of different things going on.

[03:45] **Mick**: And Blitz that get a little confusing depending on how knowledgeable you are about the game.

[03:53] **Mick**: So all that's still in place.

[03:55] **Mick**: Oh, and all the game boards are programmed, so you can actually use all the game boards now if you haven't played around with that.

[04:00] **Mick**: So a few things have happened.

[04:03] **Mick**: But of course, I'm not going to beat around the bush and make it out like we've done everything that needs to be done. We've done a lot. There's still a lot left to do despite the game being in, I'd say, a semi-decent state right now.

[04:18] **Mick**: What else? I think that's really it. As soon as, I don't know, the market bounces even just a little bit, and I have some more free time on my hands, I hope to pick this back up.

[04:30] **Mick**: I'm a little bit anxious to get my hands back on the keyboard and do a little bit more programming here. It's been a while since I've really gotten into the weeds of things, so hope to get back into the weeds of things soon.

[04:42] **Mick**: I'll keep you all updated when I have updates.

[04:45] **Mick**: The Discord knows that I don't post updates too often, but if you do have questions or you have any concerns or just want to talk things out, I am available in the Discord pretty much 24-7 and will respond to you if you reach out.

[05:04] **Mick**: What do I want to end this?

[05:07] **Mick**: Let's just say the Ergo community is near and dear to my heart. I really appreciate all of you. I hope to see all of us succeed.

[05:14] **Mick**: I hope to see Ergo succeed.

[05:16] **Mick**: And I hope to see all of you doing and building on Ergo succeed.

[05:21] **Mick**: I mean it's a lot of work to even bring something to this degree live on a blockchain and on a backend and on a front end and with a website - it's a lot of work. So make sure you all don't knock our community developers too hard because a lot of work goes into this stuff even if some of these projects aren't maybe to the point you want them to be quite yet. All that being said, thank you all again. Truly hope everybody's life is going towards the positive in these crazy times.

[05:54] **Mick**: I'll stay in touch and best of luck in the year folks. Take it easy.

[06:02] **Mick**: Bye.
