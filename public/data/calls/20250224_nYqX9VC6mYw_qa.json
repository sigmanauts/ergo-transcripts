      "asker": "implied from presentation",
      "answer": "The Sigmanauts mining DAO is the only pool that collects storage rent and operates as a DAO-based mining pool. When you join, you get a token that lets you use Paideia to create votes that can change miner payout methods for bonus tokens. It gives miners voting power on how to run the mining pool, recognizing that on Ergo, miners have control to change some parameters in the entire chain.",

The SigmaUSD Oracle pool has been updated and the script now allows updating the pool to version 2.

      "answer": "The goal is to create an LLM where you can type in a prompt describing what smart contract you want, and it outputs a smart contract that has gone through numerous training sessions. For example, you could request a simple locking smart contract or time release contract, and the system would generate it for you. There's also consideration for another fine-tuned LLM to double-check the generated smart contracts.",

      "answer": "It's very important to have all watchers up and updated because if you don't update, you're just burning electricity and the watcher won't watch any events. There was a database migration in a recent update where Docker had pulled a different version of the Postgres database, which required following specific instructions to avoid permission denied errors.",

This demonstrates that they are the only major pool currently implementing storage rent collection, while other major pools running multiple chains haven't implemented this feature yet.",
