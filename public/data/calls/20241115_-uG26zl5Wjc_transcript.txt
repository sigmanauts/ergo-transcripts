[00:15] **qx()**: Hello and welcome to the weekly Ergo AMA.

[00:22] **qx()**: Today with me, we have, wait, what's your name? I forgot.

[00:26] **MGpai**: Hey guys, I'm MGPai. Super excited to be on again.

[00:32] **qx()**: MGPai, aren't you that guy that was working on Ergo names?

[00:36] **MGpai**: Yeah.

[00:38] **qx()**: How's that going?

[00:41] **MGpai**: It's such an intricate project. I bet.

[00:44] **qx()**: We're just busting it right off the bat. What's new? What's new?

[00:49] **MGpai**: I've been trying to get some work in for Ergo names. I definitely want to finish it off. I just been really busy with school. We just had midterm midterms and all. So we have Thanksgiving coming up in the US in about a week and a half. So hoping to use that time to get more involved again in Ergo names, but we have Thanksgiving and Christmas. So I'm pretty confident I can finish it then because all our smart contracts are done. It's just off chain stuff, getting the contracts to run itself. And that's all already has progress on it. So hopefully we can have that going.

[01:31] **qx()**: So it'll be a nice little Christmas present you're saying.

[01:34] **MGpai**: That's my hope.

[01:36] **qx()**: Fantastic. Fantastic. What else is new? How's Palmyra? How's ZenGate? How's all that cross-chain business going with commodities and trading of them?

[01:46] **MGpai**: Yeah, it's going pretty well. A lot of progress. We keep onboarding new developers and scaling, because there's just so much work to be done and so many opportunities to seize with RWAs. It's quite popular, especially in this new cycle right. A lot of people are realizing that RWAs are really the path for real world utility and involvement rather than just NFTs itself right. Something a little more beneficial so yeah, a lot of progress is being done. I think the community will be really happy. Again, I don't know how much I can say, it's not my control so I'll just leave it at that.

[02:35] **qx()**: You're not gonna pull a Tom Holland and give away everything after me. That's right, that can be pretty scary can it? Dan's probably no, he sees a wake. I'm sure right now. It's pretty early over there. Nice nice. Well, what do you think of the... are we in a bull?

[02:59] **MGpai**: Oh yeah, it's pretty cool to see Bitcoin go across 90k, right? Again, it's always kind of weird though, right? From like 2022 or 2021, where alts were also pumping. It's really just Bitcoin. Little liquidity, I guess, started to flow into altcoins, but it's still not significant, which is very surprising. Hopefully, we'll see at least something, right? When Bitcoin crossed its original all-time high from 2020, it was still pretty, it was very stagnant the altcoins, but now at least we are seeing something like 10% 20%. So yeah, so maybe it's the small spark to something.

[03:45] **qx()**: 10% 20% on what?

[03:47] **MGpai**: Like across most altcoins.

[03:52] **qx()**: Yeah, well, I would say Ergo's performing quite a bit better than that. Yes. Yeah, but on average I would say probably that yeah. Yeah, so it'll be interesting to see when that if it's gonna keep on kind of a trickle in flow or it's gonna be a season again where it just spanks out and you're like, whoa, there it goes kind of thing. Exactly. Who knows, but very happy with the Ergo movement right now coming back to what the price was about a year ago and...

[04:21] **MGpai**: So hopefully the community can take advantage of this momentum. I'm very happy Rosen is doing that. I've been talking to Joe a lot about the progress for Rosen. We have Dogecoin coming up and I don't know if you guys follow the US news, but it seems that Trump has opened a new department called Department of Government efficiency DOGE. So that's quite something. So I'm sure Dogecoin will pump in the future.

[05:01] **qx()**: Yeah, I think it's up from 11 cents to 30 some cents last time I checked or something. So it's already three times.

[05:02] **MGpai**: Absolutely. But we're gonna take advantage of that right. We're gonna go to DOGE right and... Again, it's just like Bitcoin, so people don't have much to do there. So maybe we can convince them to leverage the Rosen Bridge and do something on other ecosystems with their Dogecoins. And then we're also getting Binance Smart Chain. And now I think you will start to see more fun. We've been seeing some transfers to Ethereum, but the problem is it's very expensive. So having on Binance Smart Chain allows you for a very similar environment with high liquidity, but much, much, much cheaper fees.

[05:49] **MGpai**: And another cool thing I realized is Alephium has their Binance Smart Chain bridge also coming out. So it might even be possible to interact with Alephium through each other's chains because I think they can also bridge native assets. And since Rosen already bridges native assets, maybe it's possible to go to Alephium without using Rosen, using whatever bridge infrastructure they have, since they both connect to Binance Smart Chain. So that's interesting. I've been talking to some people, but that would be pretty cool to have working. I think definitely these UTXO blockchains needs to work closer together, since there's just so few of them with less liquidity these days. So I think that'll be fun to see.

[06:45] **qx()**: Yeah, and I think once, I don't want to say more mainstream, but once people get used to the fact of crypto isn't just going to something like Robinhood on your phone and clicking and not having your own custody of your assets, and they get used to that, it's not going to be instant. I think it's going to be a long time before that happens. You'll see, I think you'll see a big spread out of liquidity across these decentralized bridges. That's where Rosen's goal is. So that's the hope I mean.

[07:23] **qx()**: I think it's good that there are things like central exchanges around for people who want that comfort, but I think in order for the survival and the sustainability and the kind of unstoppable-ness of crypto, there has to be a healthy liquidity and a healthy amount of things like Uniswap, like those kind of decentralized exchanges. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Otherwise it's like, no, we don't feel like interacting with you, MGPai. Sorry. Or we don't like a country of origin that this person's from. Nope. That's it. Bye bye kind of thing. So yeah.

[08:02] **MGpai**: I mean, exchanges certainly already do that with US citizens. Right.

[08:08] **qx()**: Right. Yeah. I was trying to, speaking of that, I was trying to give a little plug out for Cyberverse right now. Cyberverse, as some of you know, are working a lot cross-chain. So they've moved to Cardano. They are now working on the gaming chain, trying to get in there. It's called Ronin. And there's a vote up on the Ronin Discord right now. In order to be part of that, you have to have some Ronin in your Ronin wallet and connect it to the Discord, and then you can vote in Discord kind of thing. Discord DAO, I guess. Joe Arminio likes to call them. So I downloaded the Ronin app to support Cyberverse and I clicked the buy fiat, buy from fiat button directly, you know. It's gonna put in my card and I was like, nah, sorry here in the U.S. Womp womp.

[08:57] **MGpai**: Yeah, so common.

[09:00] **qx()**: So I just pinged Dan this morning. I was like, Dan, can you send me a couple ADA so that I can simple swap them over to Ronin and then vote for those guys? So I suggest if any of you guys have heard of Cyberverse, if you're up for supporting an amazing Ergo project that's actually a really fun game too, it's really simple. Just download a Ronin wallet, join the Discord and use Simple Swap to go from ADA to Ronin. You can do a very small amount. You can do like 20 ADA and you'll get a handful of Ronin on the other side and then you can vote for them in the Discord. I think they're aiming to be in the top 13. And I think they're teetering on that. So any support here...

[09:45] **MGpai**: Yeah, let's help them out. Yeah.

[09:46] **qx()**: Would be very, very helpful. Yeah. Oh, thanks. You have ADA? Of course. He told me you didn't. I'm just kidding.

[09:57] **qx()**: And what was I going to say earlier about... what were we talking about? Liquidity. I can't remember. What's new in the Sigmanauts? We have, if some of you have noticed, we found a guy from the drama a couple of weeks ago. We found a guy that came forward and was like, hey, I'll help you run the account. And that's SuperGeometry. He is doing an amazing job at the Sigmanauts Twitter. So if you guys are seeing that and appreciating that, please interact with that account and talk to it. I think he's done a post almost every day now, good posts, gives giveaways, those kind of things. He's also put up a vote for, I think, 100 ERGs giveaway per month, so he can kind of design these giveaways to get engagement on that platform and get people interacting. So that's really awesome, very active. I'm trying to repost as much as I can from the main account that is suitable, but yeah, so that's fun.

[10:55] **qx()**: We are also in the midst of getting a new multisig in the Sigmanauts. The issue with the current multisig is it's made up of early members and those early members are not always in the ecosystem hanging out. So when we want to do a transaction it takes quite a while. I think this last one took two weeks and it failed because we weren't on the same version of Minotaur. MGPai that reminds me. Where's Minar? What is it? Minar Finance? What's the name of it?

[11:28] **MGpai**: It's Moria.

[11:29] **qx()**: Moria Finance, where's Moria? Is it ready for us? Come on. Moria Finance, for those that don't know, is a very awesome web interface for multisig. It's kind of like a Cardano roundtable, if you guys have seen that, but it's very simple. You go there, you connect your own wallet, which is your own part of the multisig, and then you put in other wallets and they can go there, they can connect and sign, and it does like a round robin. It lets you know who's next and that kind of thing. So it's a really cool project for, you did for ErgoHack, two ErgoHacks ago?

[11:59] **MGpai**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, two ErgoHacks ago, yeah, yeah. I would definitely maybe that'll be Easter or something. I think possible work or Christmas because I need Nautilus like an updated version of Nautilus and Nemo has been working on it and... So I think it should be out pretty soon. I don't know if you guys have been following, but Captain Nemo has been doing a lot of updates for Nautilus as well. It's really, really good now. Especially the UI, the transaction history, and now even better transaction submissions called chained transactions. So we're definitely getting upgrades and it's preparing for sub-blocks. They've been doing really good work. So I think they've been a bit busy trying to do my interaction because it's very cryptography heavy, which is boring for anyone. But I think they'll have it. So Nemo told me that they'll get on it.

[13:07] **qx()**: The new version will show incoming transactions that you can then send before they're even out of the mempool, right? You can chain transactions. So something can come in and you can be like, oh crap, I sent it to the wrong one.

[13:22] **MGpai**: That's perfect. Yeah. I mean, developers could always do that, but we need a better, we need a good interface so anyone can do that, right? Exactly. That's the challenge.

[13:30] **qx()**: Yep. Yeah, that is neat. So the multisig we put in a vote to Paideia to have some new multisig members that are very active Sigmanauts. I believe it's Luivatra, CW, Mark the Shark, Jake the Snake, and CannonQ. We had CW like just Jake's and CannonQ myself. And I think that's at least seven of us. So once that vote passes, it should pass later today, I believe, unless a big no brigade comes up, we'll create the multisig in a little ceremony with wine and cheese, maybe some sausage. And then we'll send one big transaction from the old multisig to the new one.

[14:19] **qx()**: And then we'll talk about, eventually, the eventual goal, guys, is that we fully rely on Paideia. But as Paideia is just moving out of beta into non-beta, you know, production, it's still, we only hold maybe a couple thousand ERGs in there just to be safe in case something really bad happens. Like I think in the beta guys we had a vote going on and I made the vote and luckily, I didn't attach any money to it as a reason. Well, I guess that wouldn't have mattered but I made the vote and it... And Louie didn't use, he used a greater than sign instead of a greater than less than equation. So the vote could never reach consensus because I set it to, oh, that's what I did. I made a vote that would change the configs to have more of a consensus. And Louie wrote us immediately, he was like, guys, that's going to break your DAO. Because you're never gonna be able to get any money out of it because you're never gonna be able to get greater than a hundred essentially. And so the new version that he wrote actually has a greater than less than there so you can do those kind of things and they shouldn't fail.

[15:36] **qx()**: But yeah, so we're just being cautious there. Once we fully trust that, you'll see most of our funds flow into Paideia there for that kind of group management as opposed to something happening on Paideia and if it's more than a couple thousand ERGs we need to pay out or a special token that we have in the treasury then it's up to the manual multisig there to say yes we're seeing the vote and we're going to obey the vote and go from there. So yeah soon, super super exciting. Love Paideia.

[15:59] **MGpai**: I guess we should talk. What's that? It's awesome. It's awesome that Paideia is out. I think it's been in development for almost three years, right? Two and a half, three years. So that's a really big milestone, especially for Luivatra and the team behind it.

[16:16] **qx()**: Yeah. Well, let's talk about real quick the announcement yesterday about ErgoPad, right? Marty is kind of winding down at least his oversight of ErgoPad and Coinecta. I believe both IDO platforms on Cardano and Ergo. And I was talking to you last night about it. I think Ergo is... So, I don't know what the term for is it, but we have so many options on how to non-KYC these kind of token launches that Paideia, not Paideia, ErgoPad and Coinecta I imagine have a tough time competing with that kind of thing. You can come in, you can lock your tokens, do some other stuff. We're working on SigmaLock with you guys as well, which you can do it through. It's just it's a tough tough call there. So I feel for Marty, I feel for that. But he did offer that right. It's code that he can let anybody use and keep spinning up. So if the Sigmanauts want to take it over and have it there just so people can unstake that still don't come around for six months then that's fine. You know, I don't imagine it's too hard to keep that up. But the tough part is managing all the KYC in the back end and doing that. I imagine that is a thankless hard kind of thing to do. That's a very big headache.

[17:53] **MGpai**: So I don't blame him when you got this state of the community, right?

[18:01] **qx()**: Yeah, right. Right. Exactly. All right. Let's see, anything else in the Sigmanauts we've had... I think that's it. Why don't we jump to questions and we can go off that. Let's see what we have.

[18:19] **qx()**: Alright, let's see we have HQx says good morning. That's very clever HQx from MewFinance. We have Ahmet says do you like the QX Turkey group? Is there a specific QX Turkey? Were you asking if I like the Turkey group? There's a Turkey group, it's like at least the one that I was sucked into a couple months ago, maybe six months ago, felt like a mix between Gulag and the old bad Baseless kind of thing right in between there. It felt like the outcasts from Baseless before they got put into Gulag. At least a group I was in. I don't know if I was in an official Turkey group, but there were some pretty angry people in there. But then there were also some good people that reached out to me on DM and said, hey, don't listen to this guy. He's just being crazy. So you get a mix of everything. But I haven't been in there in a while. Maybe I'll check it out again. We'll see. We'll see what it's like.

[19:25] **qx()**: Let's see. Oh, here we go. It's a good question from Wombo 22. Hi, MG. How's it like being in the EF? Anything you can share from an insider perspective for others wanting to look in?

[19:41] **MGpai**: Oh, yeah. I mean, EF, it's very, very good to get oversight and understanding of their operations and all. And I would say a lot of cool things that I get to do as part of EF is on some development proposals. So EF is open to anyone submitting a proposal for, like making the ecosystem better or more specifically like development-wise, right? Like make a better infrastructure. For example, we support like Sigma Explorer or something along those lines. It's an explorer by PGR and it is a really good explorer, a very good UI and it has a completely different back end built from the ground up. The Ergo Explorer just uses the same API as the normal main Explorer. But this new Explorer, Sigma Explorer, it's completely done from the ground up. So it's very impressive and it has the best performance. It's definitely the fastest and most scalable Explorer we have today.

[20:56] **MGpai**: That's one of the projects that we help sponsor for hosting and all, because it gets expensive when you need it to scale. And we help out with Stability Nexus, right, with their protocols, such as Gluon. Yeah, a lot of projects, what is it, Cyberverse as well, we helped out. So that's really cool. We get to vote, there's also a bunch of projects that we can't, right? But we try to help them if they have an impact on the overall ecosystem. I think a recent one is the Sigmanauts mining proposal so I think that's very interesting and I'm supportive of it so we're still waiting to achieve a consensus on that because it's a good chunk of funds that they requested but I believe mining is an integral part of Ergo and we really ought to push for mining when we have this momentum because there's really no good GPU mineable coins at the moment. Maybe like one or two but they're all new blockchains so you don't have much trust or... They're just not very hard. Or they're just tokens that you mine on other blockchains, which is also just as much more useless. It's just a mineable meme coin at that point. So Ergo has a huge gap to fill. So hopefully, the Sigmanauts are doing a great job at trying to claim it.

[22:28] **qx()**: And to speak of that, Mark, for I think a day or so, on Monday the 11th, released his technique for mining Rosen tokens or ecosystem tokens. So the way it works is, you point to the pool you go to the dashboard where the stats dashboard and the payout dashboard? So you go to that and there's a mint button and on that mint page you can choose I want all Rosen tokens or I want all Rosen Bitcoin or I want all Rosen ADA or I want all CYPX or I want all ERGs and then you can say I want you to pay me out when it reaches the equivalent of 20 or 50 or so for the big miners. They're not getting their wallet dusted every time we get a block. So you can set that there. But then the cool thing is, too, is you can set percentages. So I can say, look, I want 10% of my token in CYPX, because I love Cyberverse. I want 50% in ERG. And I want 20% in Gluon Gold. So you can actually mine gold. It's countless thing. And so then you just leave that NFT that mints in your wallet, and Mark's software will scan your wallet and do your payouts based on that.

[23:47] **qx()**: So it's super, super cool. He had it on for, I think, two days and then pulled it back and turned on mine core payments again. He's just got a couple more tweaks to do. Sometimes when you're doing stuff in testnet, and you have, even if you have a couple people using it, there's so many things that you don't get like you would from the main group and 45 people banging against it kind of thing. So, of course, that's the beauty of the Sigmanauts DAO, Mining DAO, is that everybody that's there for the most part, is in agreement that this is a community-run mining pool and we're all there to test it, we're all there to push kind of the boundaries and do that. So that's super cool that we have that platform to do that on and that we have somebody like Mark the Shark to do those kind of new things and testing.

[24:35] **qx()**: So that's also kind of what the proposal is for the EF that Mark put out there. As well as kind of utilizing Ergo mining as an education tool for other miners and other non miners. So big project. Super cool. I hope the funding comes through for them. Because I think that's wildly important. I mean we're a proof-of-work chain. It's how we secure the damn network. We need to make sure that people know why it happens and how it happens and make it cool.

[25:10] **qx()**: I mean mining, mining core has been the same or mining pools have been the same like forever, right? Now that we're doing storage rent and this kind of swap in the middle, that's like super cool. There's what, there's that mining site that you can CPU mine like bitcoin even kind of thing? It's like a swap site. Oh nice hash. No, no nice hash...

[25:41] **MGpai**: unMineable

[25:43] **qx()**: No, no, no, no, there's a specific site you go to and you can mine whatever coin you want with whatever card you want, swaps in the background for you, but people have gone there on mine. Oh, yeah. There you go. Thank you. And the fees are just absolutely outrageous. Complete, when you're dealing with a small margin when you're mining, you got to be careful with those fees because it's gonna eat into your damn thing. So Mark is very positioned it very competitively.

[26:09] **qx()**: Yeah, HQx says unMineable here. Yeah, so competitively, so that's super cool. The other cool thing about the mining is that we've been getting a lot of notice on socials on Twitter saying, holy cow, Ergo is like number two or number one in the profitable coin to mine when it was up around 130, which I think it's around 124 right now. So we're in that threshold there where I see people saying, oh, I'm firing up my GPUs again. I'm pointing to Ergo again. Kind of thing. So that's really really exciting to see. Yeah, yeah.

[26:47] **qx()**: All right. Let's see. Who do we have here? Ahmet wants to know if kushti got mad at him. That's why he's not here. I don't think kushti stays too mad for too long, but no, he didn't get mad at you. Andy explained in the next bit there. Oh, here we go. We got Jonas, Jonas, Jonas, Jonas, if he's European, Jonas, Keystone wallet soon. That's a PGR 456, right? I think he said the end of the year recently. He said for sure.

[27:26] **MGpai**: Yeah. Currently we're blocked by a library, a rust library. What is it? There's some issue with one of the Sigma rusts, how the code works. So we have another developer, Dusek, who works on the rust. So he's trying to fix that up. So as soon as he fixes that up, PGR can continue the Keystone work he's been doing. Again, it's some cryptography thing, which is quite time consuming and tedious.

[27:56] **qx()**: And for those PGR is the guy who also did Sigma Explorer, the new explore. So just so you guys are aware of what his capabilities are. Super, super cool. Yeah, I'm looking forward to buying a Keystone wallet. They look pretty damn cool. At least the paper, like the paper like one, right? With the paper, the E ink screen looks really, really cool. Right now I use, let's see... Is this a Nano or something? I don't know. But this is pretty good. But the issue is when we do a refill of the GARD wallet, are you doing this or is this LGD?

[28:43] **MGpai**: For Cardano, it's LGD.

[28:46] **qx()**: LGD? LGD? I don't know. I forget. I mix it up.

[28:53] **qx()**: Okay, so the funny, that's LGD. The funny thing is when you do that, they're like you have to verify like 15 transactions, 15 outputs. So you're literally like with your little two fingers going button button button button button button button button button button. Like so many times you have to view it, verify it then say yes and slide over and you have to do that like ten sometimes. So while this is cool and functional and... It definitely hurts for those bigger things. So it'll be nice to use Keystone for that kind of thing. I guess you can already for Cardano, right? Yes, yes. So I could get that up there in the pipes and test it. Yeah, cool.

[29:32] **MGpai**: You should, yeah.

[29:37] **qx()**: I should. You want to send me one, MG? We've got Ahmet is on fire today like third question. Asked is Kraken listing imminent. Well, I mean at this point after that leak on the Sigmanauts Twitter, whoever that was, we fired them. They're no longer working for the Sigmanauts Twitter anymore. That's why you have SuperGeometry there. You know as much as we do at this point. That means that we're on the shortlist. They have a backlog of things on the shortlist, so we're at their whim essentially when they decide to look further into us and put that work in.

[30:29] **qx()**: That being said, I still DM Mark Twitter little sweet nothings. I think my last DM was that I couldn't stop thinking about him and gave him a Willie Nelson YouTube link "Always On My Mind." He left me unread this time. Usually he answers me. So that's I'm hopeful. I'm hopeful he left me unread for a reason. Usually he writes. Yeah. Yeah, it's on the backlog, nothing no news yet kind of thing. So we'll see. I'm hoping, I'm hoping, I'm hoping these central exchanges at some point will think, in order for us to survive... Cause these meme tokens, right? These meme chains, like you saw the post from Mark the other day, he's like, Oh, I can finally retire. I got dog with hat listed in the U S or something. And like, like...

[31:24] **qx()**: I can imagine Mark coming home from work and he sits down and his wife and kids are like, Mark, did you change the world today? And Mark's like, I did. I brought dog with hat to the U.S. for purchasing. And they were like, that's amazing.

[31:41] **qx()**: In all seriousness though, I think eventually these central exchanges, when this kind of money runs out, if it will, or when it burns down a little bit, we'll eventually see that there's value in listing something that's unstoppable, that's sustainable, that has an amazing community, like Proof of Work Ergo, like other projects as well that are similar, and they'll see a value in that. And then at some point, of course, when while trading on exchanges becomes a little more I don't know legal or whatever that's gonna be perhaps we'll be forced to actually invest in things and onboard things that are legal and are organic. So that's that's my hope there of our overall kind of thing.

[32:30] **qx()**: But then my crypto cyberpunk hope is that they all burn up in a fire and they go away. And we rely on decentralized exchanges and fiat on-ramps direct into the ecosystems for that kind of stuff. So my word to the central exchanges are, you know, be nice to be on there, but hopefully you guys can get with the times and start backing projects that are sustainable, legal, and are organic. So that's my message to them.

[33:08] **qx()**: Alright, let's see. Here we go. This is from Odi Boja. I hear Cardano will build a layer 2 partner chain where BTC will be the token. Wouldn't it make sense if Ergo joins the effort? The new chain would be a partner chain on Cardano and a layer 2 on Ergo? Are you talking about Bitcoin OS? Is that a whole other layer kind of thing? Yeah. I mean, we already have that function, right? You can bring your Bitcoin over to Ergo and do whatever the hell you want. And you can bring your Bitcoin over to Cardano, do whatever the hell you want. You can bring your Bitcoin to Ethereum and do whatever you want. I mean, I get the idea, but I don't see if we already have that functionality. Of course it's an open system, whatever anybody wants to do. But we already have that functionality as far as that goes, right. In some parts. What's your thoughts there? Are you paying attention?

[34:05] **MGpai**: Yeah, I think their technology is interesting. They use ZK proofs instead of a multisig bridge, which is very, I think, new. Not many people have done it. It's very convincing, right? The idea is you don't even need any multisig trust, right? You just have to trust one person or something like that, and you can make that yourself. That's the whole idea behind the bridge. So I think that's very interesting. Also, you've got to remember Cardano has so much money, so much developers, right? So they can do so much compared to us. We're just basically hobby developers, except for kushti. So there's not too much we can do, but I will say that whatever layer 2 they achieve, Rosen will be able to bridge to that.

[34:57] **qx()**: Right, right, right, right. Didn't kushti at some point during one of the ErgoHacks, two ErgoHacks ago, develop some sort of messaging or consensus mechanism? He read Bitcoin proofs and verified them on the Ergo chain? So is that a similar thing that they're doing with their tech? Is it the same kind of thing or no?

[35:14] **MGpai**: I mean, I guess it's more advanced, right? But I guess the ideas were quite similar.

[35:21] **qx()**: Right, right, right. Right, it's like, kushti's like rule 34. Do you know what rule 34 on the internet is?

[35:29] **MGpai**: Oh yeah, the artwork thing, yeah.

[35:34] **qx()**: It's uh, this is not a PG show MGPai. It's all right. Rule 34 states that if it exists there's porn of it on the internet, right? So kushti is like a rule 34 of crypto space. If it exists out there, kushti's probably done it six months ago. There's got to be a kushti rule 34 or something like that. That's usually the case. Oh, yeah, I did something like that a couple years ago when Ergo first came out. Yeah, it didn't work out and this is why so we did this kind of thing. The common thing you hear from kushti.

[36:04] **qx()**: All right, let's see what we have here. We have, oh, Bayoke saying good night from Indonesia. Let's see. Oh, here we go. Here's a question for you, MGPai. Let's see how much time you're spending deep in the ecosystem. HQx wants to know your thoughts on MewFinance, which I imagine includes like the utility tools that they have, the shop that they have, the mart that they have, that's the physical site as well. They're kind of staking tiers where you can get discounts on listing things based on how much you're staking and also like I think they have revenue sharing as well in those tiers as well kind of thing. So all built in there. What are your thoughts? Oh also escrow service, right? You can I can go there I can put something in a package and put your address on it and then you can come pick it up if you pay the fee that I say. What are your thoughts MGPai?

[37:08] **MGpai**: Yeah, of course, I think it's very cool. And I'm glad that people are spinning up new projects in the ecosystem. I think they're trying to fill up a gap that Spectrum DEX kind of left us. They're not really maintaining much on Ergo. I mean, they built really a lot of cool tooling already. But it's good that it's the power of open source. If it dies, the community can always take over. And I think that's what we are seeing that's happening. I know I heard that, I think a couple of Sigmanauts are selling on that, the marketplace, right? So I think, that's very interesting.

[37:43] **qx()**: Yeah, he's selling like organic honey on there as well. Sigmanauts have some, yeah.

[37:54] **MGpai**: Yeah.

[37:55] **qx()**: And then we have, I posted these guys. Ooh. So if anybody, I posted them for 75 ERGs. They're Radeon 7s. One of them doesn't post on Windows, the other one runs fine. I ran it for a day at 75% and just needs a little fan work, that's all. So 75 ERGs and you can get two Radeon 7s which... I guess if nobody buys it, I'll lower it down. I just want to get out and get them out of here. And I want to get people pointed towards MewMart. So it's more of an experience kind of thing, but they're sitting on the side of my desk, ready to be boxed up for anybody that wants them. So super cool that you can go there and get approved and sell actually physical merch. Super, super neat.

[38:50] **qx()**: Alright, let's see. Oh, Wombo, what are your thoughts on Ergo needing memes? So I talked to kushti about this last week, right? And unofficially got kushti's idea of what memes are, right? MGPai, I'll let you start. What are your thoughts?

[39:11] **MGpai**: Yeah, I think, of course, that's how you gain viral posts. I think Joe's been doing a good job. He's been posting a lot of... Oh, he's been killing it with those two videos, right?

[39:24] **qx()**: Like the wedding video from... Was that Old School? What was that? That was Old School, the wedding video with the Will Ferrell and then the show where the Sal guy from... Oh, yeah beats crap out of everybody on the bus. Absolutely. Yeah, I think the first one, the first video with Will Ferrell got... I think 10,000 views, something like that. So really, really good exposure. I wrote Joe, I was like, that's great. And he's like, is that good? I was like, for not having breasts, Joe, that's a pretty good post. I mean, it's true, right?

[40:04] **MGpai**: Yeah, of course. I told Joe to make it shorter right because if it's too long then you lose attention. I think five ten seconds is much better right because if people like it they'll spend that much time where you have to grab attention in the first few seconds. But yeah it's very good. I'm glad he's doing it. It's a good way to convey his point.

[40:30] **qx()**: And you'll start seeing slowly, kind of, not like crazy memes, but you'll start seeing slowly some more, kind of, not official, but more appropriate memes from the main Ergo account, perhaps, until people get really pissed. But we'll see. Right now, SuperGeometry is doing a great job from Sigmanauts. He's got a lot more leeway to post kind of crazy content. So he's doing that and filling that role greatly. I sound like Donald Trump. And we'll try to start, interacting that from the main account to with memes. So we'll see how it goes. If you have a good one send them to us and we'll see what we can do.

[41:15] **qx()**: All right. Let's see. Wendy moon. Hi, Wendy. Wendy is a frequenter. Is there any way to swap between Ergo and BTC and keep it off exchanges? Just do it in your wallet wrapped or BTC wallet. Yeah, yes, of course. Right. We have, you can do it on any chain, right? There's a lot of liquidity, where's the most BTC liquidity is in Cardano or is it in...

[41:44] **MGpai**: I think Cardano, but I'm not sure. I haven't messed with it. I have no reason to go to BTC.

[41:51] **qx()**: Let me see. But yeah, yeah, of course, Wendy, you can go to, let me go to ErgoDEX right now while I'm talking. You can go right from BTC through Rosen to wrapped BTC and set it right in your Ergo wallet. That way you didn't even hit ErgoDEX, or right now you could. Let's see. Let's see what the slippage is. If I want to swap a thousand ERG. Yeah, if I want to swap a thousand ERG on ErgoDEX right now without even touching Bitcoin and just get Rosen BTC, you'll take a 7.8% hit on liquidity. So liquidity is not that high on ErgoDEX, at least, or MewFinance, same smart contracts. So your best bet would be definitely to send it over the bridge, most likely if you have more than that, and just hold on to that Rosen BTC in your Ergo wallet, knowing that you have the security of Rosen Bridge and the security of another proof of work chain.

[42:52] **qx()**: I thought it was interesting that, and I talked to, mentioned this with Joe quite a bit in our talks, maybe late at night when you're drinking whiskey on the live versions of the dev updates. I thought it was interesting that people would want to send their Bitcoin to something like Ethereum. I get that there's a lot of liquidity there and a lot of financial tooling, but it's literally, I feel it's literally like taking your money out of a bank and just leaving your wallet and walking through the market essentially, whereas Ergo has developed a massive amount of tooling that lets you interact with it right from the bank and the security of that kind of thing, or essentially walk around with a safe in your pocket. So I always thought it was interesting that, that's not a thought like I'm actually going to a less secure chain essentially from something like Bitcoin. So I was, the thought that the allure of at least Ergo and the financial tooling that we have would be like, we are not compromising any security by going over to Ergo and using the financial tooling there. So I think that's something we need to try to sell a little bit more as well for that.

[44:13] **qx()**: Let's see. Answer that already. Oh, here's a hype one. You like hype questions. A big 3D question to both of you. Do you guys think Ergo can hit top 20 this bull market like Dan believes? Like Dan believes, we got to check in with Dan. I'm gonna send him that one. Yeah, you know if Dan believes it I certainly believe it. I think I think anything can happen. I'm not trying to predict anything, but I think Ergo at least has the ability to shine in the manner of security and the tooling that's there already. The lending protocols, the I mean your let alone your NFT release platform is awesome and... All the projects we have that are ready and fully baked and ready for customers, essentially, there's no reason and sub-blocks.

[45:19] **MGpai**: You guys aren't ready for that. It's going to be really good. I mean, that's a big missing piece.

[45:26] **qx()**: Hang on. MGPai. Do you have your hat?

[45:29] **MGpai**: Oh, that's a bit far away.

[45:34] **qx()**: There we go. Make mining great again. Yeah, I think we're primed for it. I think we definitely have the ability to be there and sustain, have sustainability there. The question just is, is the rest of the space ready for that are going to realize that? So we can't predict it, but...

[45:57] **MGpai**: My assumption is that Ergo closely follows Cardano, right? So if Cardano does well, I'm certain Ergo will do well. They always move so super close to each other. So I know Cardano is going to do well for sure. They've been doing really good stuff lately. So I'm certain Ergo is going to go up much more.

[46:22] **qx()**: You heard it right there, folks. That's not with your EF hat on though. That's with your community developer hat on. You said that. Right. Perfect. All right. All right. Good timing. Kilver, Kilver, our buddy Kilver. If you miss Kilver hasn't streamed in a while. Kilver, have you streamed in a while? Where are your streams been, buddy? Maybe I've just missed it. But Kilver has been an avid Cyberverse player, community member, and streamer of Cyberverse. Do you guys think now with Trump being so crypto friendly, we will see a new alt mining resurgent? You know, regardless of political standings there, I will say, I think I said it in the last AMA, prepare to be not surprised, but prepare to be like, from what I know about my experiences with being an American or a United States citizen and having Trump as president for four years and what he promised before campaigns and what he delivers on some of these things. Some of it's hype, right? Some of it's just to get voters kind of thing. But you got to look at actions. So the facts are that he's brought on your buddies, Elon Musk, right? Who is fairly, I don't know if, is Elon...

[47:43] **qx()**: Considered crypto friendly with Elon.

[47:45] **MGpai**: He's not against it. But I don't know if it's like friendly. I don't know. He's really weird. He just does Dogecoin like I think it's more of like personal amusement for him, right? Like you guys are bored, right?

[48:03] **qx()**: I really feel that way. I do. I do. I feel like if you ever finish a video game, think of it this way, and then you put in the cheat codes, you just get bored after a while. You start throwing people off cliffs or shooting people up in crazy stuff. You just do crazy stuff. So I wonder if Elon... And I think he's such a bored.

[48:23] **MGpai**: I think some people try to say he's like manipulating the market. Like he's a billionaire. I don't think he cares. No, I think he has more money than the market cap of Dogecoin or something. Yeah, market cap Dogecoin is like what 30 40 billion and he bought Twitter for more. So like I don't think he's trying to manipulate anything. He's just...

[48:43] **qx()**: No, no. No. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, he's definitely poking stuff. So I hope I still have a worry that those kind of things with how he talks about Dogecoin and those things like what's the utility of Dogecoin right now, right? Is there any utility in Dogecoin? No, no, I mean he's obviously promoting something for the social aspects and the idea of I guess a currency that's so you can spend on chain I guess. I don't know. So I think overall it's obvious that people believe that Trump is gonna be good for crypto based on the price of Bitcoin right now and some altcoins and...

[49:21] **qx()**: But I think it's my jury's still out for me, verdict's still out on the holistic approach of how crypto is going to be seen by the administration? Is it going to be seen as this? Let's I mean couldn't say Trump came out with his own token, right? And it's 70% down like come the hell on. Like they're obviously riding the same kind of speculative market that most of crypto is. So is it good for crypto? If you ask me that question as in, oh, I guess it's alt mining resurgence. We totally missed the point of the question.

[50:01] **qx()**: But in general, I think Trump is going to be good perhaps for the speculative side of crypto. Do I think he's going to be good at real organic adoption of chains that are actually making a difference in doing something? Maybe that's a side effect there. My opinion only, but we'll get to see. He's not even in office yet guys. Let's talk in January about proof of work mining resurgence. I think all it takes for a proof of work mining resurgence is the price of Ergo to go up and then people are going to mine the shit out of it. Right. That's it.

[50:38] **qx()**: All right, let's see. What else do we have? Wombo says there's another fish in the CQX, don't worry. Oh, Mark, because I was trying to seduce Mark from Kraken. Right, right, right. Oh yeah, FC, FC CannonQ. MG, Palmyra going to launch a coin or project, do you know any timing?

[51:07] **MGpai**: Oh, you're asking me, I can't say.

[51:12] **qx()**: That's, is it on, it's not on, it has what's it called? The IDO they did. People don't have the coins in possession right or the tokens in possession. They have them just investing tokens.

[51:25] **MGpai**: It's just like a pre-sale or something, right? They have rounds of that. So definitely, I can say we're having more pre-sale rounds. I don't know how many more, but that's certainly available. And again, I don't think it's open to US citizens. You have to have different passport if you want to participate, I think, but I'm not completely sure. I know the past ones were not open to US citizens.

[51:55] **qx()**: All right. All right. Let's see. What else do we have? We won't comment on that one. I think Kilver says quality content right there when we were talking about rule 34. Thank you, Kilver. Appreciate it. Any news from Sky Harbor team about the work on the marketplace? You know, Kilver, I don't know if I said this the other day, but I think mid last month I pinged Quokka during the AMA and he didn't get back to me till after, but he says the front-end UI version 2 has finished and in testing will be releasing the open source code when deployed. The backend is being worked on and there's not much work left, so the dev is still slowly chipping away at it. That was a report from Quokka. So that'll be nice when that's up. As I said, when it's up, we're hoping that we can organize the Sigmanauts to kind of take it over and manage a front end version of it from that open source code and use it as a treasury revenue stream as well as maintain it so that we can have a dev that can continuously work on it and make it better.

[53:04] **qx()**: Wombo wants me to do the dance QX. But Dan, Dan does a great job at it. He's very good at it. Kilver says that he's not, he's moving into a new house, so he hasn't streamed in a bit. He's going to start again one to two.

[53:22] **MGpai**: Congrats.

[53:24] **qx()**: Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention, guys, I've been putting some liquidity into TradeHouse on the Rosen side. I think I put about only about maybe a couple hundred ERGs worth on the Rosen side for Rosen-ERG pair as well as maybe about 200 ERGs worth of CYPX in there as well. I encourage all of you guys to go to TradeHouse and just put your project tokens in there or SigmaUSD or something. Just get a little bit in there. That's a great opportunity, that's a great place for people to come and swap where they want to be able to visually see and kind of control their slippage. They can say I'm going to set an order here and only take it at this price. And then if it matches then it's great. If not, then maybe they'll come out to your price, but it's a good tool. We're going to try to push it more on the TradeHouse Twitter, as well as try to retweet from the main account and Sigmanauts account. But we need to get liquidity. That's a big thing. That's what attracts people to these dApps. And that's what keeps things pumping. So please, if you can...

[54:41] **qx()**: Don't let that stuff burn a hole in your wallet, your Nautilus or your Terminus or your Minotaur. Go ahead and use it. Put it out there. Even if you, so let's say you're just like, I don't want to sell any of my CYPX. I don't want to sell any of my MewFinance token or Mew's not on TradeHouse, but you get the idea. That was a big thing for me too. So don't, then put it at like 10% above Ergo. So remember the way the order book works is when you put in an order to sell, you're not selling your CYPX or your Rosen or whatever for a dollar amount. You're selling it for an ERG amount, right? So you don't have to touch that. Let's say the price of Ergo goes up. Right? Your order in the price of your token that you've matched it with doesn't go up with ERG. Right? So now, nobody's going to buy that thing because it's way too expensive compared to the price of ERG. Because you're still asking for one ERG for a thousand tokens. And if ERG goes up and the token doesn't go up with it, you're asking for a higher valued ERG for the same amount of tokens. So you don't have to worry about switching it. You don't have to worry about losing or anything like that. You can take it off and put it back there.

[56:00] **qx()**: So the idea is if they both raise similar which if anybody follows CoinGecko in their portfolio or anything like that any other portfolio. What's the Ergo one that Louie made? Oh, Crooks Finance? Crooks Finance, yeah. And it is a portfolio, too, like that. You'll notice that most of the time, on average, over a series of days, these guys all raise, right? Ergo raises up, rising tide raises all ships, kind of thing. So your token rises up. The cool thing is once in a while you'll get tokens that go a little above, go a little below and catch up. So that's where you'll get those deals that people will come in and buy. So if you're worried about selling your project token then set it at 10% higher because if it spikes or ERG dips and the project token stays up then that's a good opportunity that'll come in and do that and you're not losing money essentially kind of thing and then you can always buy it back if you want to. But in short use TradeHouse, use the order book system, provide liquidity, yeah, provide liquidity. That's the big thing. That's why we look at these other chains and we're like why is everybody using these exchanges barely anything on there to do kind of thing.

[57:24] **qx()**: Well, they're using them because it's a massive amount of liquidity in the ecosystem, right? So you can do a swap and you're not losing 5% on anything. So in Ergo, we don't have that. We don't have the big VCs that are going to be pumping liquidity into these kind of things yet. So it's up to us, right? In all it takes, there's 10,000 people in chat, guys. If everybody in chat, how many in the Ergo chat? Do we know? Hang on, let's see. 11,435 people in the Ergo chat, just on Telegram's side. If everybody puts in one ERG and a thousand CYPX or a thousand Rosen and a couple ERGs, that's just a tiny amount in that order book. You're going to have $10,000 or $20,000 worth of depth in those order books. It just takes a little bit from everybody. That's it. That's it. And that's our weapon against this kind of thing. That's our answer to one dude or woman in Ethereum who puts in a million dollars of liquidity somewhere. We have to do this individually. It doesn't mean that you have to put in $10,000, just small amounts combined with everybody's effort. And we have the same effect, guys. That's all it's going to take.

[58:43] **qx()**: All right, what do we have? Well, we're at 59:05. Since you joined five minutes late, MGPai, that's the hour. Anything closing? Are you missing class for this?

[58:57] **MGpai**: No, no, we're an hour behind our daylight savings, right? So no classes start yet.

[59:03] **qx()**: Nice, very nice, very nice. All right, anything to close with, sir?

[59:08] **MGpai**: I don't know, we're going to the moon.

[59:13] **qx()**: Good closing. All right. Thanks everybody. And if you didn't hear what I said, the last five minutes invest in the ecosystem projects, play Cyberverse, list things on MewFinance, liquidity into TradeHouse, list stuff on Ergo auction house, all that kind of stuff. Use the ecosystem. There are plenty of ways to use it without the fear of losing your project tokens. If that's your worry. Cause I know a lot of Ergo people are just, let's hold it in our bags. It's so precious. We don't want to lose it. So. Do it. I have, as I say, I have about 50 liquid ERGs right now. Everything else is tied up in ecosystem projects, so do it. Don't be afraid. All right, everybody. Thanks for joining. We'll see you tomorrow for the community chat. It's on Zoom. Everybody's welcome. I'll post it on Twitter again. Just come in chat. kushti will be there. Joe might be there since, no, Joe might not, Joe's not going to be there. But we're getting devs. He announced it in the dev chat. MGPai, you're going to try to be there too. It's 3am for Dan, but maybe we can get him there with the enticement that somebody's going to yell at him. Dan likes punishment. So we'll see. Come tomorrow, I think, what is it, 4pm UTC? What was it? And check our Twitter. You'll see the link there. Thanks everybody. Enjoy your week.

[60:36] **MGpai**: Bye guys.
