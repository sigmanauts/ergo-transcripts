[00:10] **Marc the Shark**: Mark, what's up, man?

[00:12] **Marc the Shark**: Hey, Tim.

[00:13] **Marc the Shark**: Good, man.

[00:14] **Marc the Shark**: Long time.

[00:15] **Marc the Shark**: How's it going?

[00:16] **tmr.erg**: Dude, I'm doing very good.

[00:18] **tmr.erg**: I just moved and got my life in order.

[00:22] **tmr.erg**: But happy to sit down for a minute.

[00:25] **tmr.erg**: This will be episode two.

[00:27] **tmr.erg**: We had a little hiccup with our episodes.

[00:30] **tmr.erg**: And so this is episode two.

[00:33] **tmr.erg**: And today, we kind of wanted to talk about some current events.

[00:39] **tmr.erg**: First thing was just like a big thing.

[00:43] **tmr.erg**: I think it's super cool.

[00:44] **tmr.erg**: Like just the emission reduction just happened.

[00:47] **tmr.erg**: Do you want to kind of talk about that?

[00:49] **tmr.erg**: Like where are we at and where are we going?

[00:52] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, absolutely.

[00:53] **Marc the Shark**: So I think we're at 21 now as a block reward.

[00:58] **Marc the Shark**: And so I think I counted this morning, we have six more steps from a decrease of three to get to three.

[01:04] **Marc the Shark**: So sometime in 2026.

[01:05] **Marc the Shark**: So I think the miners are definitely starting to feel it.

[01:09] **Marc the Shark**: I mean, especially from earlier this year, we were at like 30, really like 33 or something like that.

[01:14] **Marc the Shark**: And then now we're... What does that make sense?

[01:17] **Marc the Shark**: Anyways, we're at something like that.

[01:19] **Marc the Shark**: And then now here we are at 21.

[01:21] **Marc the Shark**: Next one's about to be 18.

[01:22] **Marc the Shark**: So less and less are being mined, and the price is still sort of consistently the same.

[01:29] **Marc the Shark**: So it's an interesting sort of trade off from a mining perspective right now to where we're getting even less ERG.

[01:35] **Marc the Shark**: Essentially the same electricity costs around the same sort of cost to sell it.

[01:41] **Marc the Shark**: So hopefully start to see some pressure one way or the other, hopefully up, to kind of alleviate some of the mining struggles at the moment, but kind of exciting, nonetheless, another sort of halving but not so.

[01:55] **tmr.erg**: I mean, honestly, it's more than a halving since when I started, I think when I got in at 21, it was 72, right?

[02:06] **tmr.erg**: That's a lot of ERG right now.

[02:08] **tmr.erg**: And it was a lot of ERG, and we were at $10 or something.

[02:16] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, absolutely.

[02:17] **tmr.erg**: When I think about that I just learned so much about like trading and stuff like, oh, I should definitely have taken profits. I knew it was gonna happen.

[02:29] **tmr.erg**: And it was actually more aggressive.

[02:31] **tmr.erg**: The emission was more aggressive.

[02:34] **tmr.erg**: Before we changed it.

[02:36] **tmr.erg**: Do you want to talk about the emission, the contract, the new change that happened?

[02:43] **Marc the Shark**: I'm not too familiar, I guess.

[02:47] **Marc the Shark**: So yeah, why don't you go ahead and take it away?

[02:49] **tmr.erg**: Sure.

[02:49] **tmr.erg**: So there was an initial emission curve that had all of the ERG being emitted, I think in like eight years.

[03:01] **tmr.erg**: So like before 2030, like all the ERG would have been emitted.

[03:07] **tmr.erg**: And so it was like really aggressive.

[03:11] **tmr.erg**: And then they voted on this via mining, which is sick.

[03:16] **tmr.erg**: So they had people indicate their preference with a setting in their config file.

[03:25] **tmr.erg**: And they got 90% consensus, which is sick.

[03:31] **tmr.erg**: And so now, that's all.

[03:34] **tmr.erg**: Yeah.

[03:34] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, 90%.

[03:36] **tmr.erg**: I'm going to take an aside.

[03:37] **tmr.erg**: I'm going to skip the story.

[03:39] **tmr.erg**: I'll come back.

[03:40] **tmr.erg**: Anyway, so now some of the ERG gets put into a re-emission contract.

[03:46] **tmr.erg**: So that initial emission is split.

[03:53] **tmr.erg**: So some of it goes to the miners, some of it goes to a contract, and that contract is then delayed.

[03:59] **tmr.erg**: And so that is how we've created a longer tail to 2045 or something.

[04:06] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, so after we get down to three ERG, it's all going to be coming from the re emission contract.

[04:15] **tmr.erg**: Okay, right.

[04:16] **tmr.erg**: Not very much ERG.

[04:18] **tmr.erg**: And it's just a lot of pressure.

[04:22] **tmr.erg**: And kind of like you said, one way or the other, it's going to go someplace.

[04:28] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, absolutely.

[04:29] **Marc the Shark**: And it's, I kind of remember now, now that you're saying that where it's like, it was kind of a big deal in the ecosystem at the time to where I think Coastal Crypto made like a video to where it's like, the devs are like stealing your ERG, basically, it's like, oh, they're changing something in the blockchain.

[04:49] **Marc the Shark**: And in reality, you could shape it how you want, but in reality, it's like, it's for the longevity of the chain.

[04:57] **Marc the Shark**: And I'm looking at it right now, it looks like actually 2044, this month on the 27th, it looks like it'll go to zero right after that.

[05:12] **Marc the Shark**: So I mean, yeah, that's quite a long time to be mining ERG from then.

[05:18] **Marc the Shark**: And then we have storage rent as well.

[05:23] **Marc the Shark**: Because we're starting to hit it now within our mining pool within the last four years, but there just needs to be these incentives for miners to stay on the network.

[05:32] **Marc the Shark**: And even Bitcoin has that sort of kind of built into their protocol too.

[05:37] **Marc the Shark**: But like you were saying, it's, I think it's even way further out, right?

[05:41] **Marc the Shark**: Isn't it like 2144?

[05:43] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah.

[05:44] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah.

[05:46] **Marc the Shark**: Right.

[05:46] **Marc the Shark**: So that's an extremely long time that they're going to be slowly, slowly mining.

[05:51] **Marc the Shark**: So it will be interesting as well.

[05:54] **Marc the Shark**: Like we're sort of approaching these limits.

[05:56] **Marc the Shark**: So like very early on, a lot of tokens will be distributed on our network, Bitcoin's network.

[06:02] **Marc the Shark**: And it will be interesting as I guess we're approaching some sort of like a limit with respect to that.

[06:08] **Marc the Shark**: And we'll see how that actually gets to play out.

[06:10] **Marc the Shark**: It's like these sorts of parameters that we get the change now.

[06:15] **Marc the Shark**: We'll actually get to see those end results and how well Ergo's protocol worked out compared to Bitcoin and vice versa.

[06:22] **Marc the Shark**: So that'll be kind of interesting.

[06:24] **Marc the Shark**: And like in 20 years, man.

[06:27] **tmr.erg**: 100%.

[06:27] **tmr.erg**: And I'm also just really excited to see how adjustable fees and the storage rent and also things like fair initial mining offerings can support mining in that really low emission environment.

[06:45] **tmr.erg**: Like once we get to three, I feel like it's gonna make other things quite valuable.

[06:52] **tmr.erg**: It's like, you're gonna need to be paying attention to the storage rent, to like what can be scavenged and collected by your mining pool.

[07:02] **tmr.erg**: And if your mining pool's not doing that, it's probably not gonna be profitable.

[07:08] **tmr.erg**: So it's going to really incentivize innovation and people finding new ways to identify things faster or offer rewards to the miners for starting their projects.

[07:29] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, I mean, that's a great point.

[07:31] **Marc the Shark**: Because people are actually doing that now where they're able to get these, the UTXOs with storage rent, but without hash power for some reason.

[07:39] **Marc the Shark**: I don't really know the nuances of it, but somebody is able to essentially run a script and gather those UTXOs, I think without hash at least.

[07:49] **Marc the Shark**: And qx() would be the better person, I guess, to explain that to myself.

[07:53] **Marc the Shark**: And so I think, yeah, just continuing to push innovation with this sort of thing is interesting.

[07:58] **Marc the Shark**: But then you brought up fair initial mining offering.

[08:03] **Marc the Shark**: So would that be more of like a just a token on like a network to where it's like, would that be a side chain?

[08:09] **Marc the Shark**: Would that be sort of like a layer two?

[08:11] **Marc the Shark**: What would that sort of be, I suppose?

[08:14] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah.

[08:15] **tmr.erg**: OK, so I think it could be either.

[08:17] **tmr.erg**: I guess when I was talking about it, I was imagining, let's say you wanted to come up with a new protocol, like a lending protocol or whatever, and you wanted to distribute your governance tokens or something.

[08:31] **tmr.erg**: You could offer them as mining rewards to be collected.

[08:39] **tmr.erg**: So you could just add, oh, I'm going to input 10 tokens every block to be mined.

[08:47] **tmr.erg**: And I'm not sure if that's done through some sort of script, maybe like mimicking the re emission contract, or if you would just like set the block height to whatever you want it to be.

[08:58] **tmr.erg**: So it could be collected like garbage.

[09:02] **tmr.erg**: Probably either way.

[09:04] **tmr.erg**: Totally.

[09:04] **tmr.erg**: But yeah, and then it's just like, whoever gets it gets it.

[09:07] **tmr.erg**: And they're not like paying you, not a security. Howey test.

[09:13] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, absolutely.

[09:16] **tmr.erg**: And you brought up side chains and layer twos.

[09:21] **tmr.erg**: So I think also it's like those are getting mined also, right?

[09:29] **tmr.erg**: And so if you're running your miner and there's a side chain going on that's the same algo as Autolykos, it's like you're kind of getting both of those rewards at the same time, I think.

[09:43] **Marc the Shark**: Okay, interesting.

[09:45] **Marc the Shark**: Because I think it's an interesting concept and there's a lot of, I suppose it depends on like the security aspects and what you're trying to do with it.

[09:53] **Marc the Shark**: Because I think from like a token perspective, it would be interesting because I feel like that would be like the lowest hanging fruit.

[09:59] **Marc the Shark**: And if you had like all you would need to do is essentially if your mining pool supported it, you could just say, hey, look at my participation when we find a block on Ergo.

[10:10] **Marc the Shark**: Oh, you found that block on Ergo.

[10:11] **Marc the Shark**: Here's the reward you get from like Mark and Tim smart contracts, and then you get 10 tokens for that block reward and then that distributes.

[10:22] **Marc the Shark**: But then I guess you'd have to build in some like why I guess why would you want to do that, aside from like the fair initial mining offering standpoint.

[10:33] **Marc the Shark**: Would it make sense for just one pool to support it or do all pools need to support it?

[10:36] **Marc the Shark**: So it's kind of an interesting, how fair do we want it to be?

[10:42] **Marc the Shark**: Because fairness is in some sense subjective.

[10:45] **Marc the Shark**: And so it's like a spectrum even, I guess.

[10:49] **tmr.erg**: So I think when you get into like, when you get into a side chain, like you might have an application specific side chain, right?

[10:56] **tmr.erg**: So it's like a chain running, kind of leveraging Ergo security, but it has a specific purpose.

[11:03] **tmr.erg**: Like maybe there's like one dApp that just has its own little chain.

[11:08] **tmr.erg**: And then maybe it's like, they kind of to your point, like they don't want everyone to get those tokens.

[11:15] **tmr.erg**: They might want their tokens to be distributed under certain conditions.

[11:21] **tmr.erg**: So I think it just allows a lot of things to be possible, which is super cool.

[11:29] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

[11:31] **Marc the Shark**: It'd be fun to work on something like that.

[11:33] **Marc the Shark**: I saw I think Armeanio posted that as sort of like an idea for the next coming ErgoHack for somebody to work on.

[11:40] **Marc the Shark**: So hopefully somebody picks that up.

[11:41] **Marc the Shark**: That'd be cool to see.

[11:42] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, for sure.

[11:44] **tmr.erg**: So dude, did you see NiceHash is starting to require KYC?

[11:50] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, yeah, that makes me somewhat nervous as like the mining pool operator for, and even qx() right for the Sigmanauts mining pool.

[11:58] **Marc the Shark**: We've talked a little bit about it and what we're going to do and stuff.

[12:01] **Marc the Shark**: But yeah, I mean, it's cool for a lot of our tools, right?

[12:05] **Marc the Shark**: The whole point is to be permissionless.

[12:06] **Marc the Shark**: I don't need anybody's permission to join the network.

[12:09] **Marc the Shark**: So I think it's like, in some sense, bullshit, right?

[12:13] **Marc the Shark**: If I can say that here, but I don't know, what are your thoughts?

[12:18] **tmr.erg**: Oh man.

[12:19] **tmr.erg**: Like, so every time something like that happens, I just, it reinforces that I've kind of made the right choice to associate myself with Ergo.

[12:29] **tmr.erg**: Just my values align and it's like, no, like just we're trying to enable freedom and have a open permissionless transparent network for anyone to participate in.

[12:44] **tmr.erg**: And like, oh, I have to register with you and give you my personal information.

[12:51] **tmr.erg**: Like, dude, I honestly I hate doing that because I've gotten four notices in the past, I'll say 18 months that some organization has been hacked and lost my data.

[13:05] **tmr.erg**: And like, right, like what, like, stop, stop doing that.

[13:11] **Marc the Shark**: Stop asking.

[13:14] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, and then you have to give it to them for free.

[13:17] **Marc the Shark**: They're not safeguarding it.

[13:18] **Marc the Shark**: There's no protocol in place to where it's like, hey, I'm going to give you this information, and I don't necessarily have to trust your own security and privacy.

[13:29] **Marc the Shark**: Let's let the blockchain do it for us.

[13:31] **Marc the Shark**: But here we have all these people in the way with their sort of, I guess, systems that are hackable in some sense.

[13:38] **Marc the Shark**: And then here we are where it's like, yeah, then all your data is distributed.

[13:43] **Marc the Shark**: which is crazy because like even from like a business sense, you can come up with LLCs and trusts that obfuscate your own name away.

[13:51] **Marc the Shark**: So like, so in theory, like that could be a legitimate way for somebody to maybe avoid like you are tied to like this mining rig, like come up with an LLC or trust, I suppose.

[14:03] **Marc the Shark**: But so then at least it's tied in some like entity, I guess, and things like that.

[14:08] **tmr.erg**: But but yeah, dude, so something really interesting about LLCs in the United States.

[14:16] **tmr.erg**: They just made a law that you have to now associate your LLC with your legal name.

[14:25] **tmr.erg**: So there's KYC on LLCs now, so that's going away.

[14:28] **Marc the Shark**: Oh, really?

[14:29] **Marc the Shark**: Interesting.

[14:30] **tmr.erg**: Yeah.

[14:30] **tmr.erg**: I think at the start of 25.

[14:31] **Marc the Shark**: OK. Well, I better get mine ready to go then.

[14:39] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah.

[14:39] **Marc the Shark**: So I mean, then it comes back to like the first principles of Ergo of just like, again, why, like being permissionless privacy is important.

[14:47] **Marc the Shark**: Like, I'm getting ready to move to, I'm going to rent out my house.

[14:51] **Marc the Shark**: Like I don't really want my renters knowing what I own, knowing what I have.

[14:55] **Marc the Shark**: I want them to know my name.

[14:56] **Marc the Shark**: So like privacy is like extremely important especially when you're doing just like day-to-day sort of like deals and then then there becomes like all these attack vectors as you could say once you actually know somebody's like who they are and where they live you know there have been like home invasions because certain people have found out where they live they know

[15:18] **Marc the Shark**: their YouTube personality like on, or something like that, right?

[15:23] **Marc the Shark**: And then they try to steal their crypto keys or, it's shit like that.

[15:26] **Marc the Shark**: It's crazy.

[15:27] **Marc the Shark**: So I mean, to be tied to that.

[15:29] **Marc the Shark**: It's just like insane.

[15:30] **tmr.erg**: And the whole thing around KYC and blockchain is it's kind of funny to me, because it's like, I think through zero knowledge proofs, like you could you could absolutely prove that it's not you without giving away your identity.

[15:47] **tmr.erg**: That's the magic of ZK.

[15:51] **tmr.erg**: You can prove that it's not you.

[15:55] **tmr.erg**: So then what?

[15:56] **tmr.erg**: Why do I have to give you all my info?

[16:00] **Marc the Shark**: Totally.

[16:00] **Marc the Shark**: Well, I think it's just maybe like regulation trying to catch up with crypto and they're trying to do their best.

[16:05] **Marc the Shark**: They're like, oh, I don't really understand this.

[16:07] **Marc the Shark**: And they don't, I guess, maybe understand like why certain things are so important.

[16:11] **Marc the Shark**: But I think on the other hand, because it's kind of like, if you think about it, like, it's sort of like this predator prey sort of like kind of mindset and model, you can model it as to where Bitcoin to say this prey in this example, starts to come up, there's a lot of like Bitcoin people, we need to get regulation starts to come down some more predators.

[16:32] **Marc the Shark**: So there's like a balance between this sort of ecosystem model, I guess you could like sort of envision.

[16:39] **Marc the Shark**: And then eventually, I guess wondered depending on the I guess the ecosystem right you know what the predator or the prey becomes extinct right and so hopefully I guess in this case neither because they really the game is to continue to play the game and so hopefully you know we create more tools to kind of get around certain things that we essentially want to get around from a legal perspective and the legal systems like oh I see.

[17:02] **Marc the Shark**: this is really important for that reason.

[17:04] **Marc the Shark**: Okay, let's adjust this over here and kind of vice versa.

[17:08] **Marc the Shark**: We need to, I think, have the talks, but the way they're doing it is not the right way to kind of go about it, I would say, it's very, very much a lot of control.

[17:16] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, yeah, totally, man.

[17:19] **tmr.erg**: And it and it's like, just reinforcing how much they don't get it.

[17:23] **tmr.erg**: Yeah.

[17:24] **tmr.erg**: Right, right.

[17:26] **tmr.erg**: Like, bless his heart, Trump is starting his what's it called, like, freedom, finance or something.

[17:33] **tmr.erg**: And it's like, oh my gosh, right.

[17:35] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, one KYC, like, right.

[17:38] **tmr.erg**: Yeah.

[17:39] **tmr.erg**: But lucky for us, the ethos around Ergo is leading to like some really cool solutions, Lithos coming online,

[17:50] **tmr.erg**: For those of you who haven't heard of that, Lithos is like a distributed permissionless mining pool, kind of run on the blockchain.

[18:01] **tmr.erg**: So you don't, it's not like a centralized thing, like NiceHash where like somebody's responsible for all your stuff.

[18:07] **tmr.erg**: It's actually run on the blockchain.

[18:09] **tmr.erg**: And so that's coming online as 6.0 gets finished, Node 6.0.

[18:17] **tmr.erg**: I don't really know enough about it to talk about it.

[18:20] **tmr.erg**: But I think that's a sign for us to get a guest on here who has something to contribute there.

[18:29] **tmr.erg**: I think, I bet kushti would come and tell us about 6.0.

[18:33] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, absolutely.

[18:34] **Marc the Shark**: I mean, that'd be a lot of fun.

[18:35] **Marc the Shark**: I mean, just to, cause I think with 6.0 comes a lot of things just from, so yeah, we have Lithos, I think Sigma protocols.

[18:45] **Marc the Shark**: So I think that's side chains, so really sort of like, it's a door and potentially a pretty big door from like ecosystem perspective.

[18:56] **Marc the Shark**: So then once we have this, there's a lot of little, not little, I suppose, but other things we can sort of tie and attach to and then more applications, more applications mean more real world applications.

[19:09] **Marc the Shark**: And that's gonna be really cool to see.

[19:12] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, man, I think side chains are one of the things that I got most excited about when I started learning about Ergo.

[19:20] **tmr.erg**: I remember, what was it called?

[19:22] **tmr.erg**: Ergo.meta, right?

[19:24] **tmr.erg**: And it's like a sidechain cookbook is what I remember kushti characterizing it.

[19:30] **tmr.erg**: So it's like, it's just like a dev kit, right?

[19:34] **tmr.erg**: But for these like, here's how you make your sidechain.

[19:37] **tmr.erg**: And my imagination kind of goes wild.

[19:42] **tmr.erg**: Like we talked about application specific side chains, but I also like to think about building like Monero on top of Ergo.

[19:52] **tmr.erg**: That way it's like kind of capturing the more, I don't want to say extreme, but like the more maximal viewpoint of like, I really get why people like Monero.

[20:03] **tmr.erg**: It's, I think that is maybe the most valid maximalism in my view, it's like I see Bitcoin maximalism as like being conservative and not wanting to like risk all your money on some like brand new shitcoin.

[20:19] **tmr.erg**: I get it.

[20:21] **tmr.erg**: But I also think somebody who's like, No, we need to have an unstoppable tool.

[20:27] **tmr.erg**: That's Monero.

[20:28] **tmr.erg**: That makes sense to me.

[20:29] **tmr.erg**: And it just needs some legs.

[20:32] **tmr.erg**: Like we need to have DeFi, you need to have lending and borrowing and stablecoins and all this stuff and if we can we can put that on Ergo on it as a sidechain or somehow bridging it I don't know I'm not the guy to give you the technical details but if we can give Monero some legs like now we're cooking with gas

[20:53] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, yeah, that would be huge.

[20:55] **Marc the Shark**: And isn't Monero mined with CPUs?

[20:58] **Marc the Shark**: I think, right?

[20:59] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, so I mean, that's just so accessible, like everybody for the most part has a CPU in their mining Ergo, so you could probably dual mine in some aspects.

[21:09] **Marc the Shark**: And it would be cool opportunity for the Sigmanauts mining pool to kind of stand up other pools on these side chains to kind of support that and

[21:17] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, I mean, especially just with this whole KYC thing having that privacy aspect that privacy buffer just to be able to say, hey, no, I hear what you're saying government, but I'm still going to do this, and protect yourself, right?

[21:32] **Marc the Shark**: Because like, ultimately, in some places, it is against the law.

[21:36] **Marc the Shark**: I'm not trying to get arrested.

[21:37] **Marc the Shark**: I have a little one at home.

[21:38] **Marc the Shark**: So it's like, let's make sure and so having those tools building for war so to speak is gonna be very important that you have the proper tools right so if you're going against war against somebody who has bullets and all you have is a shield that can't stop bullets or something like that that's not really gonna do too well versus having like so we need the proper equipment to be able to say hey no I hear what you're saying but we're still gonna do this and it's like you're saying unstoppable so yeah it's a powerful idea

[22:06] **tmr.erg**: Yeah.

[22:07] **tmr.erg**: So I think this means we need to get somebody smarter than the two of us to teach us about side chains, about 6.0, all that.

[22:17] **tmr.erg**: All right.

[22:17] **tmr.erg**: So I'm going to move us forward.

[22:19] **tmr.erg**: We wanted to talk a little bit about something that happened a few years ago, just like a little story about something that Ergo went through and was hardened by.

[22:31] **tmr.erg**: I'm going to share my screen, and hopefully this doesn't mess up Andy's beautiful work.

[22:38] **tmr.erg**: All right.

[22:41] **Marc the Shark**: There we go.

[22:44] **Marc the Shark**: Nice.

[22:45] **Marc the Shark**: The bear whale.

[22:47] **tmr.erg**: Yeah.

[22:48] **tmr.erg**: So these are so that bear whale.

[22:56] **tmr.erg**: All right.

[22:57] **tmr.erg**: First of all, it's an awesome drawing.

[22:59] **tmr.erg**: Absolutely.

[23:00] **tmr.erg**: Bear whale, the bear whale saga.

[23:01] **tmr.erg**: This was in 2021, where a large holder was draining the SigmaUSD account or the bank, specifically attacking the RSV holders.

[23:17] **tmr.erg**: And so just to kind of give an overview, some prior knowledge, SigmaUSD is our kind of flagship stablecoin.

[23:29] **tmr.erg**: And it works by having two tokens.

[23:34] **tmr.erg**: So the SigmaUSD here and SigRSV.

[23:37] **tmr.erg**: So USD is obviously pegged to a dollar.

[23:41] **tmr.erg**: And that peg is maintained by allowing volatility in the RSV, which is like the reserve token.

[23:48] **tmr.erg**: Okay, so there's the bank that holds all the ERG, and then the value of these two tokens is, well, one of them is held stable, and then the other fluctuates based on the value of the ERG that's held in the bank.

[24:05] **tmr.erg**: All right, so these are kind of the rules that it operates under.

[24:11] **tmr.erg**: So you can always redeem your SigmaUSD, but you can't you can't mint the USD unless there is 400% of the value in the reserve.

[24:26] **tmr.erg**: So if there's not enough reserves, then you can't mint the USD.

[24:32] **tmr.erg**: And if there's not enough reserves, you also can't redeem your RSV.

[24:37] **tmr.erg**: So you can kind of get locked in.

[24:39] **tmr.erg**: And so these are the rules.

[24:44] **tmr.erg**: The bear whale was able to manipulate the rules in this first version in SigmaUSD version one.

[24:54] **tmr.erg**: Okay.

[24:55] **tmr.erg**: What he was doing was like super clever.

[24:58] **tmr.erg**: Sometimes when I'm in blockchain, I'm just like, man, I'm just not that smart compared to all these guys.

[25:04] **tmr.erg**: So he was taking advantage of the Oracle speed, right?

[25:09] **tmr.erg**: So he would jump into a position of SigmaUSD and then the Oracle is reading the markets in, I don't know, we'll say TradeOgre or whatever.

[25:24] **tmr.erg**: And he had enough ERG to sell all the ERG and that crash the price the Oracle would read that price and then so his SigmaUSD position would actually be able to be redeemed for more ERG than he bought it for, right?

[25:45] **tmr.erg**: So then he would, so he would buy SigmaUSD, crash the price, the Oracle would see that crash, and then that would be reflected here.

[25:52] **tmr.erg**: So let's say he paid 100 bucks or 100 ERG for 100 SigmaUSD.

[25:58] **tmr.erg**: Then the value of the ERG goes down to, let's say it's now his SigmaUSD is worth 120 ERG.

[26:04] **tmr.erg**: He switched back in and then bought his position back to raise the price.

[26:08] **tmr.erg**: And so he was able to like slowly collect ERG, not slowly, but over time he collected a bunch of ERG just by gaming this little system.

[26:19] **tmr.erg**: And so there's a cool article in, in the ergoplatform.org.

[26:24] **tmr.erg**: If anyone wants to read about it, you can see how the community was like learning about it, tracking his wallets.

[26:31] **tmr.erg**: People started writing scripts to kind of try to get around this and not let it happen.

[26:38] **tmr.erg**: And eventually what the team had to do was slow down the rate of change that the Oracle could report.

[26:48] **tmr.erg**: So I think it's now, they limited the update to 0.5% every 30 minutes, up or down.

[26:57] **tmr.erg**: And so now if the bear whale tried to do it again, he would actually have to hold the price down for longer and for more than 30 minutes if he wanted a 0.5% change.

[27:12] **tmr.erg**: And so it might not be really worth the risk.

[27:15] **tmr.erg**: And actually when it happened, I think he lost, this article says he lost 170,000 ERG trying to keep doing it after they patched the protocol.

[27:29] **tmr.erg**: Which I just thought was like a really cool story about, finding an attacker who had, it's just like a, not like a clever, good on him, but ended up prevailing in the end.

[27:44] **Marc the Shark**: How long was the whole saga?

[27:45] **Marc the Shark**: Like from, like, when I guess from the initial attack to when they patched it.

[27:50] **Marc the Shark**: Cause I would imagine once they kind of figured out like, Oh, wow, I see what's happening.

[27:55] **Marc the Shark**: We need to kind of act now, I'm curious about that.

[27:58] **tmr.erg**: I'm not sure.

[27:59] **tmr.erg**: I'm not sure how long it was.

[28:02] **tmr.erg**: It says something about between $2 and $4.

[28:10] **tmr.erg**: So probably not that long.

[28:12] **tmr.erg**: I bet it was like six months that the version one was going.

[28:17] **tmr.erg**: And then they updated it to version two.

[28:23] **Marc the Shark**: I mean, thankfully that happened now, honestly, versus like, imagine if we had like multiple bear whales attacking at the same time, just essentially attacking the network in that aspect.

[28:38] **Marc the Shark**: And especially when it was like so, so high in terms of price.

[28:43] **Marc the Shark**: And even some people now say the price is being manipulated in some sense.

[28:50] **Marc the Shark**: And maybe, maybe it is.

[28:52] **Marc the Shark**: With all these guys with all these, like a hundred thousand or he lost like, so he must've been using a lot more than a hundred thousand.

[29:00] **Marc the Shark**: That's a lot.

[29:03] **tmr.erg**: I mean, I don't know how I feel about like, okay.

[29:06] **tmr.erg**: So I think the term manipulation is a little bit funny because to me, if it's just like a market, and people are selling and buying and like, you could do whatever you want.

[29:21] **tmr.erg**: Absolutely.

[29:21] **tmr.erg**: I think the only time it becomes really unethical is like, if the founders are doing something, like if the Ergo Foundation treasury is being used to like, do the bear whale thing, like that, that's messed up.

[29:37] **tmr.erg**: But if it's just like some rich guy, like it's what it is.

[29:44] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah.

[29:44] **Marc the Shark**: So take as much control as you want, right.

[29:48] **Marc the Shark**: So I mean, the rules are there.

[29:50] **Marc the Shark**: If you can do it, then send it.

[29:51] **Marc the Shark**: I totally agree.

[29:54] **Marc the Shark**: But yeah, something's happening, I guess.

[29:56] **Marc the Shark**: But in any case, it's interesting, though.

[29:59] **Marc the Shark**: It's like, how does somebody even figure out that you can even do the thing that the bear whale did?

[30:06] **Marc the Shark**: Like that must've taken some serious, or maybe not, I don't know.

[30:10] **Marc the Shark**: I mean, I haven't really played too much around with it, the idea, but sounds pretty complicated and complex to be able to kind of sort through.

[30:18] **Marc the Shark**: And then obviously they had some pretty confidence in doing it, especially since, even after it was patched, they kept sending it and sending it and trying it and trying it.

[30:28] **Marc the Shark**: So then realize, oh wow, okay, maybe they fixed it or something like that, right?

[30:32] **tmr.erg**: Yeah.

[30:33] **tmr.erg**: And even more to my point about like, it's like, whatever, it's just like how the world works.

[30:39] **tmr.erg**: This ended up hardening the, not just the SigmaUSD protocol with the changes, now it's stronger, but it led to like, oh, like, we could come up with maybe simpler designs or other more secure designs for stable coins.

[30:54] **tmr.erg**: And that's led us on to Dexy and Gluon, which are super cool.

[31:02] **tmr.erg**: I'll just share the gluon design.

[31:07] **tmr.erg**: It has these two tokens that are kind of like SigmaUSD and SigRSV.

[31:12] **tmr.erg**: This is the stable coin that's not really stable.

[31:15] **tmr.erg**: It's just pegged to gold.

[31:16] **tmr.erg**: And then this is the reserve token.

[31:19] **tmr.erg**: But you don't just buy one.

[31:22] **tmr.erg**: You have to mint both, which is pretty cool.

[31:25] **tmr.erg**: And that allows for a lower reserve ratio requirement.

[31:31] **tmr.erg**: Since everyone's like simultaneously minting both of these and then and then they have to sell, if you actually just wanted gold, well, then you have to sell your guac over here.

[31:40] **tmr.erg**: I keep calling it guac, G-A-U-C. You have to keep selling this and then you get then you get all gold or only gold and that leads to the protocol earning fees.

[31:53] **tmr.erg**: So that it can kind of maintain that peg by, super cool.

[32:01] **tmr.erg**: Just like another, another version of it.

[32:05] **tmr.erg**: And then this, Dexy Gold.

[32:11] **tmr.erg**: So Dexy Gold is, I think maybe even simpler, where it's just an auto, arbitrage mechanism, right?

[32:20] **tmr.erg**: So there's like a bank.

[32:22] **tmr.erg**: So when this came out a long time ago, I tried to make like a visual of it and this could be totally wrong.

[32:28] **tmr.erg**: So I would love for somebody to just kind of make fun of me for not understanding.

[32:34] **tmr.erg**: This is a long time ago.

[32:36] **tmr.erg**: Okay.

[32:36] **tmr.erg**: So the Dexy I think works like this.

[32:40] **tmr.erg**: There's, there's like the bank where, it can buy and sell, tokens out of this AMM.

[32:49] **tmr.erg**: And that is reading the Oracle price for gold.

[32:54] **tmr.erg**: And so that's how it decides what to do.

[32:58] **tmr.erg**: If the price needs to go up or down to match the price of gold, then it takes the action in the AMM.

[33:05] **tmr.erg**: And then users are able to interact with the AMM.

[33:08] **tmr.erg**: So they're buying and selling.

[33:09] **tmr.erg**: And then the fees go to the bank.

[33:11] **tmr.erg**: So the bank's value is going to grow over time and capacity will increase as users use the protocol.

[33:22] **Marc the Shark**: That's awesome.

[33:23] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, I thought it was cool.

[33:25] **Marc the Shark**: So what's, I guess, the difference then between Dexy and Gluon?

[33:30] **tmr.erg**: So Gluon, it has that reserve.

[33:35] **tmr.erg**: You're sending your ERG in and then receiving these two tokens.

[33:40] **tmr.erg**: And then the algorithm kind of balances the value of those two and it has that reserve token.

[33:49] **tmr.erg**: Dexy doesn't have a reserve token.

[33:51] **tmr.erg**: It's just, yeah, it's, how did he say it?

[33:56] **tmr.erg**: It's one token with like two protocols.

[34:00] **tmr.erg**: So instead of two tokens with one protocol on Gluon, interesting.

[34:06] **tmr.erg**: Yeah.

[34:07] **tmr.erg**: So in Dexy, it's just like gold and ERG.

[34:10] **tmr.erg**: And there's the bank doing stuff.

[34:12] **tmr.erg**: And then there's the AMM doing stuff to balance the price.

[34:16] **tmr.erg**: That's what I think.

[34:17] **tmr.erg**: And I'd love to like, get some nuance.

[34:20] **tmr.erg**: So maybe that's another episode in the future.

[34:23] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah.

[34:24] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, I think so.

[34:25] **Marc the Shark**: Because I have like a lot of questions like, why would you want to have a reserve like who who makes the reserve?

[34:30] **Marc the Shark**: So do you have to do like, initial funding of it?

[34:34] **Marc the Shark**: And then there's builds the reserve versus like, Dexy is looking at the bank, in terms of gold.

[34:44] **Marc the Shark**: And then I would imagine, right, because of the reserve token, there's probably nuances to where you could do arbitrage between these gold stable coins back to back, because of how their mechanisms kind of increase and decrease their prices.

[34:58] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, so I think, I think Dexy might actually, I think you're right, like you would have to kind of fund that bank.

[35:06] **tmr.erg**: But it eventually is like a locked protocol.

[35:08] **tmr.erg**: It's a protocol owned liquidity there.

[35:12] **tmr.erg**: Nobody owns that.

[35:14] **tmr.erg**: It's non-custodial.

[35:16] **tmr.erg**: It's just locked in a contract that operates autonomously.

[35:20] **tmr.erg**: It's not like somebody's ERG is sitting in that bank.

[35:24] **tmr.erg**: That's what I think.

[35:26] **Marc the Shark**: But then how does the gold, I guess, work into the play then?

[35:28] **Marc the Shark**: Because then, I guess, technically, you're buying gold, right?

[35:32] **Marc the Shark**: But then where's the actual gold I suppose, come into play because wouldn't in theory the bank buy real gold in order to have, right?

[35:44] **tmr.erg**: In a real life thing, yes.

[35:46] **tmr.erg**: So this is minting those tokens and the value is represented in the AMM.

[35:53] **tmr.erg**: So it has ERG and the gold tokens and the bank can mint gold tokens and buy and sell those in the AMM.

[36:06] **Marc the Shark**: Right.

[36:06] **Marc the Shark**: I guess I'm confused on just like what it's backed by.

[36:09] **Marc the Shark**: Like, well, how does it inherently hold?

[36:12] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, just ERG and the Oracle.

[36:17] **Marc the Shark**: Okay.

[36:17] **tmr.erg**: Interesting.

[36:18] **tmr.erg**: It's well, I think it's similar to like SigmaUSD, where it's like, it's just algorithmic and like, yeah, is this worth a dollar?

[36:29] **tmr.erg**: It's just a token.

[36:30] **tmr.erg**: Right.

[36:31] **tmr.erg**: But since you can sell your SigmaUSD for $1 worth of ERG, that's what makes it valuable.

[36:40] **tmr.erg**: That's what like ensures its value.

[36:42] **tmr.erg**: And so the same thing here, you're getting this token that's like, yeah, it's not real gold.

[36:49] **tmr.erg**: Which would be really interesting.

[36:50] **tmr.erg**: I would love to have like some warehouse actually selling tokens that you could go get.

[36:55] **Marc the Shark**: Right.

[36:56] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah.

[36:57] **tmr.erg**: Right.

[36:58] **tmr.erg**: But in this case, it's like, no, it's just this autonomous protocol that will give you the oracle price of gold in ERG when you want it.

[37:08] **Marc the Shark**: So it's more of like a synthetic gold, per se.

[37:14] **Marc the Shark**: So would the same be true for Gluon in the reserve token?

[37:18] **Marc the Shark**: But it would be more of like a synthetic, but like with a reserve, I guess.

[37:21] **Marc the Shark**: And then that has its own, I guess, inherent properties relative to, I guess.

[37:26] **tmr.erg**: Yeah, so Dexy, I think, uses the users mostly and the bank to buy and sell things to maintain that price.

[37:34] **tmr.erg**: And then Gluon uses the algorithm to kind of tell you how much you can purchase these for or redeem your reserve token for.

[37:44] **tmr.erg**: And that reserve token is going to go up and down, kind of like exaggerated movements of the ERG to BTC price.

[37:52] **Marc the Shark**: Right.

[37:53] **Marc the Shark**: No, that's very fascinating because I mean, imagine like, being able to do this just for and I think that's kind of almost where like, ChainCash comes into play to where it's like, kind of take these models of where it's like, okay, let's just get rid of gold, it's abstract away.

[38:09] **Marc the Shark**: And then like, let's put like my house.

[38:12] **Marc the Shark**: And then you can like tokenize your house and then sell certain aspects of your house or whatever real world applications actually make sense, I suppose, like actual gold would be sick, like, Yeah, here's my my warehouse of gold.

[38:25] **Marc the Shark**: We've got 10 bars or whatever it is.

[38:27] **Marc the Shark**: And then that's what kind of how they're doing with the which would be very similar to the ETF, what they're doing with the Bitcoin ETF, in some aspects.

[38:36] **tmr.erg**: Dude.

[38:38] **tmr.erg**: So funny that I've admitted this right now.

[38:40] **tmr.erg**: On Twitter, I actually I spam Peter Schiff and tell him that he should be tokenizing his gold on the Ergo blockchain.

[38:51] **tmr.erg**: He could sell it and earn.

[38:53] **tmr.erg**: I mean, you could earn a 1% fee.

[38:54] **tmr.erg**: Like, why don't you do that?

[38:56] **tmr.erg**: And just every time someone needs to buy or redeem their their gold token backed by his gold, he owns a gold company.

[39:05] **tmr.erg**: It's like, okay, but there you go, bro.

[39:06] **tmr.erg**: Like you hate Bitcoin.

[39:08] **Marc the Shark**: Right?

[39:09] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah.

[39:11] **Marc the Shark**: Does he like blockchain though?

[39:13] **tmr.erg**: I don't know.

[39:14] **tmr.erg**: I don't know.

[39:15] **tmr.erg**: His whole position is weird, because I think like, the gold and Bitcoin value proposition is just so similar.

[39:22] **tmr.erg**: Like, yeah, like, why hate one or the other?

[39:25] **Marc the Shark**: Totally.

[39:26] **Marc the Shark**: I was actually just thinking the other day, I'm like, I should buy some gold, like, that should be something, buy some of those assets and silver, and uranium.

[39:37] **Marc the Shark**: like.

[39:37] **Marc the Shark**: Okay, uranium.

[39:38] **Marc the Shark**: That's why you have to let me know how to buy that.

[39:41] **Marc the Shark**: Oh, just stocks, bro stocks.

[39:43] **Marc the Shark**: I don't actually own any uranium.

[39:46] **Marc the Shark**: Tim's building nukes out in Arizona.

[39:49] **Marc the Shark**: My kids are gonna be weird.

[39:52] **Marc the Shark**: You actually work for the CIA.

[39:54] **Marc the Shark**: So it's cool.

[39:56] **tmr.erg**: All right, brother.

[39:58] **tmr.erg**: Is there is there anything else you wanted to talk about today?

[40:01] **Marc the Shark**: No, I think that we definitely talked a lot and hit a lot of good, exciting topics.

[40:07] **Marc the Shark**: So I mean, maybe we save it for the next episode.

[40:10] **tmr.erg**: Yeah.

[40:11] **tmr.erg**: So just a disclaimer to everybody.

[40:14] **tmr.erg**: I don't know what I'm talking about.

[40:15] **tmr.erg**: I'm just a guy and I like to read a lot.

[40:18] **tmr.erg**: I don't understand everything perfectly.

[40:20] **tmr.erg**: So if me and Mark get something wrong, I'd love to learn and you can be a guest and come and drop your knowledge on us.

[40:28] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, please do.

[40:29] **Marc the Shark**: I mean, for sure.

[40:32] **Marc the Shark**: Correct us and let us know how it is, please.

[40:36] **tmr.erg**: Yeah.

[40:36] **Marc the Shark**: I'm an idea guy.

[40:37] **Marc the Shark**: That's it.

[40:38] **tmr.erg**: That's it.

[40:38] **tmr.erg**: Right.

[40:41] **tmr.erg**: I like that Rick Rubin clip where he's like, no, I'm not good at music.

[40:47] **tmr.erg**: I don't know anything.

[40:49] **tmr.erg**: I know what I like and what I don't like.

[40:51] **Marc the Shark**: Right.

[40:51] **Marc the Shark**: He's just this hit producer for all these bands.

[40:55] **Marc the Shark**: It's like, cool, cool, cool.

[40:57] **Marc the Shark**: I mean that and that's honestly that's a good takeaway just in life it's like and even with Ergo right it's like well if you really want to get excited and do something you just got to be excited and do it you don't really need to know like whatever here we are we don't know everything about Ergo we're talking about it so and it's fun having a blast doing it yeah all right brother i hope you have a great day stay safe out there cool see everyone

[41:25] **tmr.erg**: you
