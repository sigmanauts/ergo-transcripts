# Ergo Community Call Summary
**Date:** December 11, 2024  
**Title:** Last Byte Bar | Marc The Shark | ErgoHack 9

## Executive Summary

Marc the Shark presented the Mining Rights Protocol (MRP), an innovative blockchain system that creates a "synthetic GPU mining environment" on top of the Ergo blockchain. The protocol allows users to purchase rights tokens that grant them the ability to emit new tokens when they successfully mine blocks, essentially creating a dual reward system for miners. The system is inspired by traditional mineral rights and aims to provide sustainable token distribution through a rights-based mechanism enhanced by NFTs.

The presentation covered the complete technical architecture, including proxy contracts, distribution bots, and user interfaces for both protocol owners and rights holders. Marc demonstrated working prototypes and outlined a comprehensive roadmap that extends beyond basic token emission to include NFT minting tied to mining activity and potential staking opportunities. The project represents a novel approach to token distribution that leverages Ergo's mining infrastructure while creating new economic incentives for participants.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Core MRP Concept**: Rights-based token distribution system where users buy rights tokens to earn emission rewards when mining blocks
• **Technical Architecture**: Two-proxy contract system with rights tokens, emission tokens, and NFT bonuses for enhanced rewards
• **User Experience**: Separate interfaces for protocol owners (setup and management) and rights holders (purchasing and claiming)
• **Bot Infrastructure**: Real-time block scanning system that verifies mining activity and distributes rewards
• **Gamification Elements**: NFT bonuses, commemorative tokens, and potential multipliers (like 1.2x lifetime rewards for early adopters)
• **Economic Model**: 10-year emission schedule with halving mechanism similar to traditional cryptocurrencies
• **Future Expansions**: NFT minting system tied to mining randomness and potential staking opportunities
• **Partnership Opportunities**: Possible integration with Sigmanauts mining pool and MewMart marketplace

## Decisions Made

• Continue development of core protocol foundation with existing working prototypes
• Transition testing to testnet for security validation and attack testing
• Develop SDK/toolkit for broader community adoption
• Plan potential token launch after full system implementation
• Explore governance structure using Paideia DAO framework

## Notable Quotes

> "This is essentially a mining protocol kind of on top of the Ergo blockchain and allows for sort of dual rewards." - Marc the Shark

> "It's like a synthetic GPU mining system. Instead of mining, we're running these bots. Instead of GPUs, we're buying and selling rights tokens." - Marc the Shark

> "We're using this sort of mining randomness whenever they're going to find a block to then mint a NFT." - Marc the Shark
