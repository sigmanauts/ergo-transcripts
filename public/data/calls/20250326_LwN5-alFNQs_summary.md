# Ergo PoW Blockchain - Dev Update Summary
**Call Date:** March 26, 2025  
**Duration:** ~64 minutes

## Executive Summary

This developer update call featured qx() and Joseph Armeanio discussing the current state of crypto adoption, Ergo's development philosophy, and recent technical progress. The conversation covered the dichotomy between institutional blockchain adoption (focused on surveillance and control) versus true decentralized systems that prioritize privacy and user sovereignty. A significant portion focused on Ergo's unique position as a project driven by ideological commitment to "free banking" rather than traditional funding models.

The call emphasized Ergo's resilience through community-driven development, where contributors like kushti work without direct salary compensation, motivated by the vision of creating fair, transparent financial systems. Technical updates covered progress on multiple fronts including Nautilus wallet improvements, node optimizations, sub-blocks development, and various ecosystem projects like Rosen Bridge and Lithos.

## Notable Quotes

**Armeanio**: "If you can change the emission consensus around money and you can change the distribution mechanics around money. And you can build systems that are more transparent... I think that as systems advance, a lot of exotic financial instruments that were at one point only reserved for the select few will become common."

**qx()**: "The scary thing about open source is that anybody can take your stuff and spin it up and try it themselves... So the challenge that our developers face... is that they now need to think that... anybody can take [their code]... So I need to come up with some unique property that makes me better than anybody else."

**Armeanio**: "If somebody rebuilds a Rosen bridge, that's better. And it leads to more adoption. Fuck yeah, do it... That is progress. That is how progress is made."
