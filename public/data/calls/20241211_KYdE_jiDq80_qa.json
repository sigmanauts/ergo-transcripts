      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "Beene is a proof of funding platform that enables projects to raise funds while rewarding contributors with tokens. Contributors who provide funds to projects receive contribution accounting tokens (also called proof of funding tokens) as rewards for their participation.",

      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "Contributors can provide any amount of funding tokens to the contract and immediately receive a proportional amount of proof of funding tokens. This works as long as there are proof of funding tokens available in the contract, serving as both accounting and proof of their contribution.",
