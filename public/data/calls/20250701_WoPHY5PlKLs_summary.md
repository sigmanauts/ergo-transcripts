# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary

**Call Date:** July 1, 2025  
**Call Title:** Blitz TCG Update | Mick | Ergoversary 2025

## Executive Summary

Mick from BlitzTCG provided a personal update on the trading card game project's development status after several months of limited communication. He explained that significant life changes including moving, changing jobs, getting engaged, and building horse facilities have consumed much of his time and financial resources over the past 4-6 months. Despite these challenges, Mick reaffirmed his commitment to the Blitz project as a passion project and provided a technical update on current game functionality.

The game remains in development with approximately half of the necessary card abilities completed as of April 2025, when development was paused due to funding constraints. While the game is technically playable and downloadable, it's not yet in a polished state for full release. Mick expressed optimism about resuming active development when market conditions improve and his personal situation stabilizes.

## Key Discussion Points

• Personal life updates affecting project timeline (move, job change, engagement, property development)
• Funding challenges due to crypto market conditions and personal financial constraints
• Current technical status: game downloadable but not fully complete

• Recent improvements: animations added, metrics screen updated, deck builder enhanced
• All game boards now programmed and functional
• Security updates and backend maintenance continuing
• Development paused in April 2025 due to funding issues

## Decisions Made

• Development will resume when market conditions improve and more funding becomes available
• Mick will continue maintaining backend systems and security updates
• Community communication will continue primarily through Discord
• Project remains active as a passion project despite current pause

## Notable Quotes

> "Blitz is of course a project that requires funding to complete, primarily because I am not talented enough by myself to do the very many things that need to be done to make the game successful"

> "At the end of the day, Blitz is still a passion project for me, still near and dear to my heart. I still hope to complete it in totality sometime in the near future."

> "Make sure you all don't knock our community developers too hard because a lot of work goes into this stuff even if some of these projects aren't maybe to the point you want them to be quite yet."
