      "asker": "AI",
      "answer": "In the classic approach, there are only two transaction states: unconfirmed and confirmed. For a seamless user experience, this is not enough - we need at least four states to properly inform users about what's happening with their transactions.",

      "asker": "AI",
      "answer": "In the positive case, a transaction passes through three stages: prepared, in mempool, and confirmed. There's also a fourth state - cancelled - which can occur at various points when something goes wrong with the transaction.",

      "asker": "AI",
      "answer": "The 'prepared' status is what the user should see immediately after pressing the swap button, before the transaction is actually sent. This provides immediate feedback with a visual indicator (double blink and bar loader) to show the user that their action was registered.",

      "asker": "AI",
      "answer": "There are five scenarios: 1) User cancels in wallet, 2) Transaction rejected by mempool, 3) Transaction replaced by another with higher fee, 4) Input box becomes invalid while in mempool, and 5) Block reorganization occurs after confirmation. All cancellations show a shake animation with red highlighting and cross icon.",
