# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** October 17, 2025 (Call titled October 16th)

## Executive Summary

The Ergo community held their 6th-8th community AMA call, featuring discussions primarily around the recent Ergo Meetup in Colorado and various technical developments. Key participants included qx(), Grayman, CannonQ, Kushti, Byron, and TMas. The call heavily focused on the success of the in-person meetup, highlighting presentations from developers like MGPi, Cheese (Lithos), and others, as well as technical discussions around upcoming protocols and local trading systems.

A significant portion of the discussion centered on SilverSense, a proposed local trading system using silver-backed tokens, and broader concepts around decentralized finance applications. The community also discussed plans for a potential 2026 meetup in Acapulco, Mexico, coinciding with the AnarkoPulco conference in late February.

## Notable Quotes

> "It was anything but boring, especially considering that a couple of these projects are really just on the threshold of coming to fruition, like Lithos. This fall is going to be very interesting for ERG, regardless of what the market does." - **Grayman**

> "All of us were just in awe of the research and the foresight that went into this protocol. So thank you." - **CannonQ** (addressing Kushti)

> "I don't think that any of these DEXes are ready for what's coming their way. Once we get that shit online, it's going to start slow because nobody knows. But once people figure out that that's possible, why would you go to a DEX?" - **Grayman** (on Machina Finance)
