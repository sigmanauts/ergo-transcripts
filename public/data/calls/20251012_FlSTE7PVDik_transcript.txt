[00:00] **Armeanio**: All right. Everybody that came in person, thank you for coming. It's pretty cool to see a little group of people focused on the same thing. Ultimately, peer-to-peer networks kind of replicate real life where your community, people you know, people you exchange with kind of create the basis for everything in your life, right?

[00:29] **Armeanio**: And that's one of the really interesting things about decentralized systems, is that on one hand you have like technical parameters, but on the other hand you have a social system. And kind of like any social system you have various levels of like trust, sometimes you could call that belief. And in the extreme, I would even say it's healthy to have an element of faith in each other, people in your networks.

[01:02] **Armeanio**: Now that is both something that can offer a lot of benefits. It can allow you entry into a peer-to-peer system, but it's also something that is an attack vector, right? If you have people that kind of exploit your trust or your belief or your emotions, that doesn't always end well.

[01:24] **Armeanio**: I had a presentation put together to kind of cover the basis of Ergo itself. And then I was thinking last night, everybody here anyway, and many people that are probably tuning in already know these things, right? So what is the point of just repeating, I don't know, what's publicly available, and anybody with some time, energy, or desire can easily read?

[01:53] **Armeanio**: Now I know that's somewhat of a skill that's being lost, is the ability to read, but it's there, right?

[02:05] **Armeanio**: I do think it's fascinating kind of the events of yesterday, right? So let's just speak to the moment. Yesterday I was out having some beer and some food with some of the people that showed up completely oblivious to, you know, the workings of kind of the broader crypto ecosystem and you come back and they're like, oh, you know, there's been a spiral effect of deleveraging and, you know, billions have been removed from the market and what's happening and all these people I don't know, hopefully manage their risk, right?

[02:44] **Armeanio**: A good starting point is understanding like risk management and leverage. Leverage is a powerful tool when it's needed, right? But it's also risky. It's not without its trade-offs. And I think that sometimes you have the talking heads in the crypto industry that do not like to talk about risk. And I think that's a fundamental failure of the cryptocurrency ecosystem broadly.

[03:20] **Armeanio**: Because ultimately in our world, money is a control system, right? We live, let's say, within the United States. You have a group of people on a hill somewhere, they say, right? And they go into a room and they discuss in private. Okay, publicly they'll say we have two parameters. We want to have employment at a certain level. We want to have inflation at a certain level.

[03:52] **Armeanio**: And those two don't necessarily correlate in terms of how they move anyway, right? But they go into a room in secret and everybody around the world gathers and watches. Say, what are they going to do with our money? What is going to be the cost of money? And we sit around and speculate and sometimes people have fun on polymarket or whatever.

[04:12] **Armeanio**: And eventually smoke comes out of the chimney and we say, okay, this is our new updated policy. They forked the network, so to speak, and this is going to be the cost of money. And we go through this ritual, you know, regularly, people around the world tune in and watch and position and try to kind of front run whatever that trusted setup is going to be.

[04:43] **Armeanio**: And then on a higher level we have this idea of, let's call it the type of cross-chain tariff, right? Where arbitrarily you have new costs added to the system. That's, I guess, what was a part of the madness yesterday, more or less. Let's see. Where suddenly, you know, you have these two economies that interact and we're going to add a hundred percent tariff, right?

[05:18] **Armeanio**: And there's no real consensus mechanism to understand what is coming, right? It's a trusted system where the individual has very little power. They have very little power in terms of understanding what the assumption is today and what the assumptions are going to be tomorrow. And that's not the type of environment that produces I don't know, the right mindset for risk itself, right?

[05:57] **Armeanio**: And that's one of the most interesting things about this idea that started with Bitcoin is saying, okay, can we have a system where the parameters are set? Right? Where monetary policy is more or less set, and then build economy on top of set expectations. And based on how the network is set up, within a certain set of assumptions, you can assume honesty. That's powerful.

[06:29] **Armeanio**: If you look at kind of the traditional system that we're all born into, it's something we just naturally inherit. It changes depending on where you're from, right? But it's kind of more or less the same system where you have high concentration of power and then of course one of the most profitable things is to be close to power, right? Close to where money is being distributed from and generally the further away you get from that initial distribution point of money, the more inflation and expansion of money supply tends to hit, right?

[07:15] **Armeanio**: I would say a lot of the crypto industry has really gotten away from first principles. And in my opinion, that's based on toxic social systems. Because that social system is inherent to these type of networks. Where you constantly have people that are saying, trust me, believe in me, have faith in me. And I think that is not the ideal environment to create the systems that we want to build, right?

[07:51] **Armeanio**: It's a part of why, at least with Ergo, I've always tried to push for building public. We should ideally have these primitives in place that are the equivalent of public goods. They're open, they're auditable, and hopefully through time and with testing, they also become extended, right? They become extendable.

[08:18] **Armeanio**: You could look at something within the Ergo network like SigmaUSD, right? You have first it's based on research, right? It's not something that is just willy-nilly thrown together, which we do see a lot of that in the space, right? So as an experiment, it has a solid foundation, right? Then you have kind of open code, open parameters around that experiment.

[08:50] **Armeanio**: That even if the experiment itself experiences difficulty, you have the ability to extend it, adjust it. It's open, right? It's open to new ideas. It's open to new iteration. And ultimately, through time, I think we can build solid public goods with that framework.

[09:12] **Armeanio**: And my hope would be that creates its own flywheel effect. Everybody in crypto these days will talk about the flywheel in terms of financial games. The ideal, in my opinion, is to create flywheels with software to where you have these public goods that can then be reused, right? And the more diverse these building blocks come, you can suddenly cater to a larger class of functions and applications and build something that has a solid foundation.

[09:51] **Armeanio**: Sometimes we get away from this idea of open code. And I think that type of transparency should be a solid base for a healthy social system because it's based in trust, right? Not faith.

[10:11] **Armeanio**: You know, we are a proof of work network. And proof of work, one of the interesting things is a coordination mechanism is it's leaderless. It's apolitical, right? And that's something that people often struggle with, like grasping in terms of the social system. You know, they'll say, hey, Armeanio, you need to go dance over here. Go do over there. You're supposed to be a leader.

[10:40] **Armeanio**: And it's like, well, I have a certain set of skills, right? But meeting everybody that attended, and I'm sure everybody watching, you have a different set of skills. No different than in the off-chain peer-to-peer economy, you bring different skill sets, different abilities, different specialties that you've developed through time in your life, and you create value using those.

[11:07] **Armeanio**: I don't think there should be that much difference. I'm not universally intelligent enough to be the leader of everything, right? I have my areas where I would say I've learned and grown and developed a certain skill set, but in other areas, you do not want me in charge, right? I'm not the guy.

[11:28] **Armeanio**: And people struggle with that. Because in social systems, a lot of the competition is to be the guy, right? You know, certainly if I have people's trust and belief in faith and they follow me, you know, I guess that's an attack vector that we see all the time in crypto.

[11:55] **Armeanio**: And it's funny how, you know, the sheep are taught their entire life to fear the wolf. And then in the end, the shepherd eats them. Right? You know, so having that basis of how do we create trustlessness, not just in software, but also in the social system itself, that takes responsibility. It takes a collective responsibility, right? We're going to build things the right way.

[12:31] **Armeanio**: And at least in Extended UTXO, there is a trilemma, let's call it. You have the contract itself. You have the off-chain logic. You have the front end, right? In the ideal scenario, all three of those can be replicated locally. That's what I would say makes for a decentralized application. That's pretty clear parameters, right?

[13:00] **Armeanio**: So as an ecosystem, I think it's healthy to really push for that. That's something that I've always tried to promote. And it's hard to build open code, right? Because you are in essence being naked in public. It is sometimes a process to get there, right? But I think that is ultimately, a solid goal in terms of building public goods.

[13:30] **Armeanio**: You know, so we hear about this trilemma in blockchain all the time. You know, you usually have, it's a selling point. For lack of a better term, it's a selling point. But I do think that within the Ergo ecosystem anyway, I would like to promote the idea of our own little trilemma, which are those three aspects of an application.

[13:54] **Armeanio**: And ideally, if you have those three aspects that are open, and you have tooling that becomes kind of a common knowledge base for developers to use and build off of. You have things in place to start creating the right flywheel. That's kind of hard to bootstrap from nothing, but I think we've done a pretty good job as a whole of creating that mindset and mind-share.

[14:22] **Armeanio**: There have been a lot of developers, some of which are here, some of which choose to remain faceless, which I totally respect, that have contributed to that type of mindset. And so, you know, everybody that's contributed to that ideal public goods, I kind of have to tip my hat to you, that's ultimately powerful when it comes to not just the network itself, but also the social system of the network.

[14:56] **Armeanio**: Now, from first principles, crypto should be about the distribution of power. Proof of work kind of represents that in terms of the distribution mechanism of money itself. It's something that you can certainly compete for and build into, but having clear assumptions in terms of distribution of power is needed.

[15:22] **Armeanio**: And sometimes that is buried behind really good marketing. Sometimes that's buried behind social systems. Sometimes it's buried behind this trust me bro mentality that permeates the crypto industry and I think that's toxic and I don't really care if people don't like that. Right because if you can't call a spade a spade your social system is not going to work right. That's just honest.

[16:01] **Armeanio**: I know there's a lot of financial games and cultural movements and things like that. I've said from day one, for me personally, I would rather go to a casino. I know the drinks are free. That's a solid assumption that I can bank on every time. And whatever my parameters of risk are with the games that I play, at least I know that assumption is going to hold.

[16:29] **Armeanio**: Now, security is another powerful mechanism of both the network parameters and kind of this social layer, because we do need to address both, right? Sometimes we see them as separate and they're extensions of each other, you know, in terms of what people accept.

[16:51] **Armeanio**: Security, at least in our industry, is something that's formed through time. You usually have research as the bedrock of computer science. Then on top of research, you have implementations where people will try to take research use engineering skills to convert that into something that's tangible. And then you have the test of time, which kind of is the ultimate teacher in life.

[17:27] **Armeanio**: So having things that are built on a solid foundation and are introduced and kind of go through this test of hardening through time ultimately should be a goal. That doesn't mean you can't innovate, right? It doesn't mean you can't extend. It doesn't mean you can't provide research.

[17:49] **Armeanio**: Certainly in Ergo, we have led in various areas of implementing things that kind of came from the academic sphere. But I think there's an element of wisdom in being conservative, right? And sometimes that is not the focus of the crypto space, right?

[18:11] **Armeanio**: Innovation is wonderful, but I would also say that sometimes iteration is innovation, right? Where you take something, you extend it. It holds you extended, it holds you extended rather than, you know, trying to reinvent the wheel for the 700th time and, you know, it's good for marketing. It's not necessarily good for security, right?

[18:35] **Armeanio**: Because you have a weird curve distribution where through time, you know, usually you have the research side, right? And like the engineering complexity let's say, is much higher. And then through time, as it becomes more of a standard, it becomes easier to adopt. There's better tools.

[18:55] **Armeanio**: Like that whole process of evolution is not something that you can cheat very effectively. It's something that is much slower than the hype cycles that people are taught, right?

[19:15] **Armeanio**: So I want everyone to remember when it comes to security that time is ultimately the test. We can look at the first principle of privacy, which is probably fundamentally one of the most important things we need to explore.

[19:33] **Armeanio**: There is some potential future where the children people in this room have could grow up into a world where every economic transaction they touch is audited, stored, and you know, you could watch every penny that someone has touched throughout the course of their life. That type of control system is getting to the point where it's technically possible, and that should frighten the hell out of everybody, right?

[20:05] **Armeanio**: That type of system, I do believe there are some powers in this world. That's where they would like to take humanity, right? Because it certainly offers them greater power and control.

[20:23] **Armeanio**: And so I think having the ability to remain private, anonymous, have your personal space is going to be one of the most fundamentally important things that we need to work to protect as an industry. And that doesn't just mean we're going to add zero-knowledge proofs to everything and have more control systems in place.

[20:50] **Armeanio**: I think that's a bit of a perversion from privacy itself, right? That's a trade-off that many people see is quite sexy, right? Where, you know, we're going to have ZK compliance and, you know, if you just get more and more and more and more ZK compliance, you have a stronger control system.

[21:11] **Armeanio**: So I think we need to really look at this idea of privacy, make that an absolute, chase that on multiple layers of networks rather than have it be toy. Because, you know, I would say in some cases, yes, it does offer like visibility assistance in terms of people not seeing your transactions or what's happening, but in terms of the broader assumption, it's toy privacy, it's not real.

[21:46] **Armeanio**: And I think we need to be very clear in terms of what our set of assumptions are long term with privacy and what the goals are with privacy. Because there are a lot of projects, there's a lot of research beyond Ergo itself that is valuable in terms of preserving privacy, preserving anonymity.

[22:11] **Armeanio**: I think that ultimately should be one of the most important tenets of creating censorship-resistant systems and censorship-resistant money.

[22:23] **Armeanio**: You know, the other area has to do with inclusion, right? We are seeing a mix in the space where it comes to regulated assets, non-regulated assets, bearer assets, non-bearer assets. And that needs to be something that there's a lot of clarity with, because not everything in crypto is the same.

[22:49] **Armeanio**: I know that in the social layer, everything is a ticker with some letters in it, right? But the underlying assumptions that you need to make in terms of custodial, non-custodial, is this a bearer asset, is this not a bearer asset, is probably going to get even more complex when we start seeing regulated assets appearing.

[23:13] **Armeanio**: We've kind of seen some of this freeze and seize with stable coins, but the crypto industry is changing. Even yesterday or two days ago, there's an announcement that these 10 major banks are going to collaborate and create some stablecoin instruments. Oddly enough, they tend to be the same banks that are in the corporation that's on the hill, but that's the side journey that probably not the rabbit hole for right now.

[23:48] **Armeanio**: But that type of assumption of inclusion is going to get really important. I do know that kushti has been working on a whitelist mechanism, which I think is probably the better way to deal with uncertainty in terms of power.

[24:11] **Armeanio**: Where, you know, rather than you join and you might get blacklisted at any time for any reason, you make a voluntary agreement. And hopefully there's clear assumptions in that agreement in terms of the risks that you're inheriting in doing that, right?

[24:28] **Armeanio**: Last is probably this element of resilience, right? And ultimately, I think that's why open source code is so important because good ideas are hard to kill, right? I do hope not just within Ergo, but within various aspects of the cryptocurrency space and some of the privacy space that's been around, we're able to develop tools that ultimately develop into truly resilient systems.

[25:01] **Armeanio**: I've operated under the belief that over the long arc of time, the only thing of value in cryptocurrency really is state resistance. Everything else will probably, in my opinion, distill down to the common denominator underneath, which is centralization.

[25:22] **Armeanio**: Because if you're not shooting for state resistance, ultimately the most efficient thing is going to prevail through time, and the most efficient thing will be centralized. No, maybe it'll be pseudo centralized. We can have a debate whether Amazon Web Services is distributed, decentralized, because you have data centers all over the place that optimize speed.

[25:49] **Armeanio**: But I would say that in terms of power distribution, we have to be honest and say, OK, it is distributed, but the actual concentration of power there is pretty apparent.

[26:06] **Armeanio**: So over time, if we build on first principles, I do believe that the crypto space is capable of developing open source tools for coordinating capital and creating systems where within a certain set of assumptions, we can assume honesty.

[26:29] **Armeanio**: And luckily, at least with Ergo, we have this proof of work mechanism that has a pretty well time tested mechanism of what are your assumptions of honesty? What are your attack vectors?

[26:43] **Armeanio**: In terms of the contractual layer that we've come up with, it is relatively conservative. So I think those are solid building blocks towards a larger goal.

[27:02] **Armeanio**: Sometimes within the social layer of crypto, you sign on to TwitterX, whatever you want to call it, and you listen to the, I don't know, commentary, the talking heads. It does kind of leave you wondering, what the hell are we doing? Right?

[27:23] **Armeanio**: Why are we here? And I think that ultimately should be the most important aspect is we need to have clear intent and clear purpose. Because if you don't have clear intents and clear purpose, you're not going to be grounded in what you do, right? And crypto as a whole, I would say, needs to be more grounded, right?

[27:50] **Armeanio**: I do hope that over time, we create a tool set that's diverse enough, you know, and again, an extended UTXO that's going to be contractual, it's going to be off chain, it's going to be front end wise. We create enough tools around those three problem areas, the trilemma, let's say, that we can serve a diverse set of needs.

[28:18] **Armeanio**: And I think sometimes marketing and kind of just social spam buries that intent, right? So my hope in going through all of the presentations that we've set up all of the speakers, everybody here is doing really unique things that are targeted that improve like the assumptions that offer new tools and understanding that as a piece that can be replicated within a whole, over time I believe will lead to a broader tool set that's powerful.

[29:02] **Armeanio**: And I think we've done a pretty good job as an ecosystem developing open public goods, sets of tools that have led to some interesting things. We just went through a major upgrade with Sigma 6, new node version, right? And that will open the door to a lot of new capacity.

[29:34] **Armeanio**: And I hope that as we kind of build to enhance new system capacities, we stay focused in on mission. Because that type of purpose I think is important. It's not just important for like solid programming, beyond the network, it's important for the social system.

[29:57] **Armeanio**: And the social system in crypto is very toxic. It's just honest. You know, I sometimes have said, you know, my favorite thing is seeing all of these tools that enhance individual power, takes responsibility. My least favorite thing in crypto is people that look for a savior, right?

[30:20] **Armeanio**: Because that's not really how peer-to-peer networks work. That's the client-server relationship, my friends. So if we get back to this idea of saying, okay, how can we distribute power across peers and empower peers to have tooling, to have access, to have software that ultimately can serve them and their needs, that's the ideal for cryptocurrency.

[30:50] **Armeanio**: I would say everything else is just digital money. And I think we need to kind of lean into that because, you know, the possibilities if, you know, privacy does not work as an industry, if resilience doesn't work as an industry, the trade-offs are huge in terms of the world long-term, you know, that could be spun up around us.

[31:18] **Armeanio**: And, you know, sometimes I wonder what kind of world my children will live in, right? Like, I can see myself, I was born into this strange system, you know, you got the people on the hill, you've got, you know, this distribution of power that I can't really touch or interact with much.

[31:40] **Armeanio**: But what about the future? How much stronger could that get theoretically? And that should scare the shit out of everybody, in all honesty. So for me, I think that kind of sums up the purpose, the intent of why I'm here, right? It's the only thing that matters.

[32:04] **Armeanio**: So I do hope that as an industry, it's something that, you know, we can mature around, look at all of the trade-offs of control in different areas and build wisely. So I'm going to kick it off to MGPai and Luca. I need to set up their mics, set up their presentation, get them ready to go. But thank you everybody for tuning in and enjoy.

[40:33] **MGPai**: Hey, guys. So that was a great speech from Joe. And thank you to Joe and the Sigmanauts for sponsoring and hosting this event. It's wonderful to finally see some faces. So today, we're going to be talking about Palm staking on the UTXO model.

[40:54] **MGPai**: So over the last year or so, I worked on implementing a native token staking platform on Cardano. And as you know, Cardano and Ergo are very similar in terms of how their contracts work. And they all share the UTXO model. So I'll try to keep this as easy to understand as possible so everyone can understand.

[41:26] **MGPai**: So we have some existing implementations of staking already. So if you guys don't know, over the last cycle DeFi summer, we had sushi swap and pancake swap. And for really anyone new here, pancake swap was like how Solana is today. They had all the memes and they were going crazy with all the meme coins, all the launches, and staking with those meme coins.

[41:58] **MGPai**: And before PancakeSwap, we had SushiSwap, which really was a Uniswap clone, but they actually did some research and they were the first ones to implement this native, the modern native token staking or ERC20 staking. So sushi swap had this staking which really is to incentivize people right because staking makes people hold their tokens right so it kind of stabilizes price movements and yeah sushi swap pioneered this and then we got pancake swap which basically copied it and made some improvements and really brought it to the mass users, right?

[42:41] **MGPai**: Tons of people were just making meme coins and having staking with it. So, you know, you don't sell those meme coins and, you know, kind of like inflation and Ponzi scheme and so on.

[43:11] **MGPai**: So let's have a refresher. So what is the account model and what is the UTXO model, right? So the account model is... Let's start with UTXO. So what are UTXOs? UTXOs were pioneered by Bitcoin, right? That's how they started their entire system.

[43:35] **MGPai**: So UTXOs stand for unspent transaction outputs. And it's basically the outputs of the previous transaction you did. So when you submit a transaction, you have a bunch of metadata, right? You have what went into the transaction and what came out of the transaction. And the outputs of this transaction are referred to as UTXOs.

[44:01] **MGPai**: And the transaction model really is an exact digital analogy to cash. So let's say I have a $10 bill, and I want to pay for $6 coffee. It's probably $8 now, no inflation. And if I want to pay for $6 of coffee with my $10 bill, I can't just rip the bill in half, right?

[44:25] **MGPai**: I have to spend the entire $10 bill. So what do I do? I give the cashier my entire bill and that's it. They have the bill. They're not going to rip it in half or anything. It's just gone. But they're going to give me back $4. And this $4 is completely new. It's not the original bill, it's just completely new. The $10 I had, it's gone.

[44:49] **MGPai**: So this is how you can think of the UTXO model. When you have an input, it always must be spent. It's always unique. You cannot spend an input more than once. Unlike cache, I guess the cashier could spend it in other places. But in the UTXO model, it can be only spent once.

[45:09] **MGPai**: And another analogy that I like is with the old-fashioned piggy banks, right? So you would have savings in a piggy bank, and if you ever wanted to spend it, you would have to smash it open, right? It's like a one-time thing. So you can also think of that, right? I have $10 in my piggy bank. The piggy bank is the UTXO, and that's like the input, right?

[45:33] **MGPai**: And then if I want to actually spend it, I would smash the piggy bank open, and it's gone, right? Just one time. So that's really a brief overview of the UTXO model and Cardano and Ergo both make use of this.

[45:52] **MGPai**: So what's the account model? Account model is really the newer model and it was pioneered by Ethereum. And account model really is analogous to your bank account where you just have a list of transactions saying that maybe $10 was deposited and you're spending $1 and you have a list of transaction history, right?

[46:18] **MGPai**: So addresses are seen as accounts and you just have a direct tally of balance. And the thing with this, and I think of it as a problem, is that you need global state, right? So you need to know the history of everything from the start, right? When the account got funded to how much you have now, to know how much you have at this moment, right?

[46:41] **MGPai**: You have to do some calculations, right? Some balance add, balance deductions and so on. So but this is overall how the account model works and it is also quite popular, right? All the Ethereum forks use that and Solana uses that and all the newer model and newer blockchains also use that.

[47:04] **MGPai**: For those of you following Cardano, they have a new blockchain called Midnight that they're probably going to launch next quarter or so. And Midnight uses a hybrid of account model and UTXO, so it's quite popular.

[47:25] **MGPai**: So let's talk about the advantage of account model in the context of this staking. Staking is more analogous to a client-server interaction. What that means is that a server is really just a computer that never turns off. It's always running in the background. Client is really the people who hit that server. You need to talk to that server to do something.

[47:50] **MGPai**: For example, if you're logging into your email account, you're accessing a server which holds all your emails and all. And you're the client, you're trying to log in from your laptop. So that's a client-server interaction.

[48:08] **MGPai**: So staking is similar to this interaction, where the stakers are the clients. And they deposit their tokens to a contract. And this contract, you can think of it as like a server in the sense that the contract has to manage all the global state, right? It has to track the balance so it knows how much rewards that you get, right?

[48:33] **MGPai**: Because rewards are a function of how much tokens you deposit and how long you have deposited them for. So Solidity is the smart contract, a very popular smart contract language that runs on this account model. So Solidity is perfect, right? It has a single authoritative contract storage, right?

[48:58] **MGPai**: So you have something called a map, and a map is a very basic data structure that you have a key. So a key is like the user, like your user, your wallet address. And if you access the data within that wallet address, you have a bunch of data like how much they have deposited in the contract and how long they had the tokens on and all sorts of useful information. Perfect for this.

[49:25] **MGPai**: And then this doesn't translate well to something in the UTXO model. So for UTXO contracts, you have a single UTXO, right? And each UTXO, you can think of it as its own entity. So an UTXO has its, each UTXO can have its own contract. So a contract's state release with respect to the UTXO it's inside of.

[49:51] **MGPai**: So a UTXO has this bottleneck, right? You can't just store infinite data in it, right? The UTXO, you have a size limit. And you also have a broader transaction size limit because you can argue that, hey, why don't you have a bunch of UTXOs, this single UTXOs, interact with?

[50:11] **MGPai**: So you can have a bunch of data. So if a UTXO data size limit is 4 kilobytes, you can be like, OK, why don't we just do 1,000 UTXOs? Why not? Why not make it like four gigabytes or something, right? No, that's not possible because you have your bottleneck by transaction size limits.

[50:31] **MGPai**: You can only deal with a specific amount of UTXOs per transaction. And then on top of that, you also got the block size limit, right? So you can only have a certain amount of transactions per block. So a lot of bottlenecks here. So how can we move on with this?

[50:51] **MGPai**: It almost seems impossible to bring something that needs such a large global seed. Because remember, this might translate to like 10 users, 100 users. But how are we going to scale to like 10,000 users? Because each user are going to have some size of data that's not going to scale. So how do we do this?

[51:18] **MGPai**: So I had to rethink staking on the UTXO model. So data stored for the global variables, so for all sorts of staking calculations, they need to be bound to a constant size limit. You can't have it scale with the amount of users, right? So you can't be like, OK, one user is like one gigabyte of data, right? 10,000 users is 10,000 gigabytes.

[51:44] **MGPai**: We can't scale like that. It has to be one user is like one gigabyte of data. A million users is still one gigabyte of data, right? How can we make that happen? It has to be constant.

[51:54] **MGPai**: So a clear solution which several projects on Cardano and Ergo follow, so I think the people behind Crux Finance, I'm forgetting their name, I think they're shut down now but you know they pioneered a staking model and then a bunch of Cardano projects have their own staking.

[52:21] **MGPai**: So what do they do? So they have some sort of position or UTXO or NFT that you can think of which indicates a share of how much they have staked, right? So let's say you stake a certain amount of tokens, you'll get back like a unique token saying that, hey, this person staked like 100 tokens on the platform at this time, right?

[52:45] **MGPai**: So if you ever want to claim that stake back, make an update, you have to deposit that unique token you got back into the contract, right? And this is a pretty straightforward and well-known solution to this problem. However, this was not ideal for ZenGate's purpose because of legal conflicts.

[53:07] **MGPai**: The problem is that you can have derivative markets of something like a position token because I can take my position token and I can be like okay I don't want to be in this anymore but I don't want to lose like that accumulation of rewards right like maybe like the longer you stake the faster you earn rewards or something right it keeps compounding so maybe I sell it to someone else or just give it to someone else right or what if...

[53:36] **MGPai**: So you create these derivative markets, and it's a conflict from a legal standpoint. I don't know why, but it is what it is. It's a very gray area in general, unfortunately.

[53:48] **MGPai**: So I thought of this data structure called a Merkle tree. And this was absolutely perfect. So on Ergo, you have the AVL tree. And it's quite similar, so it can just translate to Ergo.

[54:06] **MGPai**: Also, what's actually really interesting is that the Merkle Tree data structure is something that was just implemented at a contract level on Cardano. However, on Ergo, ErgoScript, you have AVL tree as like a native data structure within the language.

[54:23] **MGPai**: So what that means is that basically you can trust the data structure on Ergo more because like the core team, so basically kushti made the implementation like in the compiler itself, right? So it's not like a third party code that you're trusting to be correct, which is like, which is the case on Cardano.

[54:46] **MGPai**: So let's see what is a Merkle tree, because I honestly barely knew about it until I did this.

[55:04] **MGPai**: So a Merkle tree is a tree-based data structure. And a tree-based data structure, you can really think of it having a root at the top. And it has branches pointing to more roots, right? So you can kind of see that data structure in the diagram behind me.

[55:22] **MGPai**: And the boxes, they're called nodes. So you have one root node. It's the main node on top. Then you have those lines are called branches. And then you have another node that's called branches. They're like intermediary nodes. And all the way at the bottom, you can see a bunch of nodes, like the final nodes. Those are called the leaves.

[55:45] **MGPai**: That's just a very well-known data structure in computer science. So a Merkle tree is a variant of this data structure. And it's made by hashing hashes of data. So I know that's confusing. So let's break that down.

[56:01] **MGPai**: So behind me, you can see that you have a block of data, like a block of files. So A.txt, B.txt, C.txt, D.txt. And you hash this block of data. And hashing really means is that you take data of any size and you convert it into a fixed-sized string of a certain data size.

[56:25] **MGPai**: So in this, or in most cases, it's always 32 bytes of data. So it's like a string of 64 characters. And the cool part about this, which is really important in a security context, is that it's irreversible. So if you have this fixed-size string, you can't get the data back. It's impossible.

[56:46] **MGPai**: But that's beyond the scope of this presentation. So again, you have a data, and you transform it into a fixed-size, unique string. So you can see A.text has a hash H1Z2, B.text has its own hash, and so on.

[57:04] **MGPai**: So how does this translate to a Merkle tree? So look at the tree behind me. All the way at the bottom, the leaf nodes, you can see that we brought those hashes over, right? The H1Z2Y77A and so on, right? So those are the hashes brought to the node, and they're at the bottom.

[57:24] **MGPai**: So now you look at the left side, the bottom left side of the tree. So we take the H1Z2Y7FA. We can't read it from here. And so those are the hashes for A.text, B.text, right? So we take those hashes and we concatenate them. We put them together. And we take the hash of that.

[57:48] **MGPai**: So the hash of that, you can see, is right above those two. So it's U67R on the left side. And again, we do this exact thing on the right side. So for C.txt and D.txt, and we get a hash. Now those hashes in the middle, again, we take them, we concatenate them, and we get the hash. And that final hash is called the root hash.

[58:17] **MGPai**: So why this is really cool is because you can find differences between two states, so meaning like two different trees. So if you made any modifications, you can find the difference between them like really fast because think of it logically right if you have two pieces of data what do you have to do you have to iterate through them right like one like bit at a time like the smallest like unit of difference right you have to iterate through them so you know if there's like a million pieces of like units of data you have to make at least like at most a million iterations right it doesn't scale so with this it's a lot faster right it's like the log of a million maybe that's like like a thousand or ten thousand.

[59:03] **MGPai**: I don't know, but it's a lot significantly faster, right? So let me explain this further. So you can see that we had the text files, right? And we changed the contents of C.text. And what does that do? We got a new hash. So you can see A4W12, right?

[59:24] **MGPai**: So on the right side of the Merkle tree, you can see that all the way at the bottom, that changed, right? It's in yellow. And now, since that changed, the hash above it, which is, remember, made by concatenating the hash of C.text and D.text, that also changed, right? And since that changed, the root hash also changed.

[59:46] **MGPai**: So you can see here that when you traverse the tree, you first check the left side. And you're like, oh, the left side's exactly the same. So you know that A.text and B.text is clearly unchanged. But then you go to the right side, and you can see that, OK, D.txt isn't changed, right? Although at the bottom right, it's still the same.

[60:06] **MGPai**: So then you know really quickly that C.txt is changed. So it's a really clever data structure. It actually powers so much of the modern infrastructure. You just don't know it. But that's a quick introduction to a Merkle tree.

[60:25] **MGPai**: So yeah, you can see here the comparisons made, right? So on the left side was the original tree, and the right side is the tree with the C.text changed. So you can see we just make three comparisons. So this scales really well.

[60:46] **MGPai**: So now what we actually use for the staking is something called the Merkle Patricia trie. And what this is is basically an optimized version of the Merkle Tree. So a trie really is a, you can think of it as a key value map indexed by the key's nibble. So it's just like a bunch of characters, like ASCII characters. And that's what a trie is.

[61:18] **MGPai**: And Patricia is just an optimization of the path, right? So it's a very optimized structure. So you make even less. So in the previous slide, we made like three traversals, right? So this makes it even smaller, like maybe like one or two. And then Merkle is from what we discussed before.

[61:41] **MGPai**: And then the proof is the path of nodes that you traversed, right? So in the previous slide, we traversed through like three nodes. So that's like the proof, you can think of it as that. And then proving, right? What is the action of proving?

[61:55] **MGPai**: So you have the inputs of the known root hash, right? So the hash all the way at the top, you have that. And then you provide the proof. So you provide that path. And then you provide the key and the claimed value. So you walk through from the root node to until you get to the key. You walk through the tree.

[62:19] **MGPai**: And then once you reach to the value, you stop. And then you compute the root hashes from that traversal. You can do that same hashing from the scratch. And then you compare it. Hey, is the thing I computed, does it match what I already know? And if yes, then you know that everything's correct, like no one's messing with anything, right?

[62:43] **MGPai**: And yeah, so membership is proven when the computed root equals the known root. And the known root is what you passed in.

[62:56] **MGPai**: So let's talk about how this integrates into staking. So client balances are stored in this trie-based data structure and on-chain, so in the contracts itself, only the root hash is stored. And remember, the root hash is a fixed size string of 32 bytes, right? Because it's a hash.

[63:21] **MGPai**: And that answers the problem in the, you know, we saw a couple slides back where we want one user to be, say, one gigabyte of data, and we want a million users to still be that one gigabyte of data. So it's constant. So in this case, it's always a constant 32 bytes, which is incredibly tiny.

[63:44] **MGPai**: So it's always this number, even if we have a million clients, which is really cool. And thanks to that Merkle tree diagram I explained, it's hashes of hashes of hashes and so on. So any time any insertions or updates done, the contract does verification.

[64:02] **MGPai**: So as I explained in the previous slide, you have a proof and you have the known root hash. So you provide the proof and the known root hash. And what does the contract do? The contract only does computing, right? It only does verification. It doesn't need to do all the data storage or anything, right?

[64:22] **MGPai**: You provide the exact data that it needs. The least amount of data it needs to actually prove what you're doing is correct and you're not providing false information. So, and remember, after all of this is done, so if there's any like mutations sent to the state, so meaning like if you added more stake or you did a claim or you did a withdrawal, that's a mutation, right?

[64:47] **MGPai**: The only thing that changes is the root hash, right? So it's always that constant size length.

[64:54] **MGPai**: When these updates and claims happen, you're providing the proof. The downside of this is that you have to store this data somewhere. It's not magic. So you have to store the data in your own server, right? It's called the off-chain. So you have to store the data.

[65:18] **MGPai**: You're responsible for storing the data in Solidity. You can just throw it on the blockchain and just make sure, like the EVM nodes, right? The Ethereum nodes, the heavy 2, 3 terabytes, 6 terabytes nodes, right? That stores all of that, right? So you just worry about that. But on the Ergo sense, you are storing the data.

[66:01] **MGPai**: Great. No, that's an excellent question. So we got Grayman asking, what if the staking platform goes down? Or what if I just disappears, everyone's screwed? What if I just take down all my servers? Well, that's actually not going to be an issue. Because like I said, you're not trusting me with the data.

[66:23] **MGPai**: I can't just magically change the data. Because all the mutations, they're done by putting them through the contract right so if you have like some initial state you have to put it through the contract to get the next state right so the contracts always the intermediary between state changes so the contract does all the checks it needs to do.

[66:49] **MGPai**: Regarding the data, it's really cool because you can actually walk through the blockchain, walk through all the blocks and you can always recalculate it. It's not magic. The blockchain doesn't store the data but it has like... You can think of it as snapshots in time, right?

[67:07] **MGPai**: So you can traverse through all the original snapshots and get back the current data, the most recent current state. So no, you're not trusting me, and you have as much security as the contract provides. Is that clear?

[67:54] **MGPai**: Right, and so the question is, how can you recover if the data is just all hashes? Then what you can recover, because hashes are non-reversible. No, that's a great question. So off-chain obviously doesn't store the hashes. So whenever you actually interact with the transaction, you're providing the actual data, not the hash, the actual data.

[68:20] **MGPai**: Into the transaction when you build it and you submit the transaction. And the contract is actually what hashes the data. So you provide the complete open data. You're not hiding the data. And then the contract does the hashing and the checking.

[68:38] **MGPai**: So like I said, it does computation, right? The contract only does computation. So you provide the raw data, and the contract just does hashing of the data. And this is possible because of, yeah, so I have it in this slide here, that whenever you do any staking, you provide the actual raw data.

[68:59] **MGPai**: And it's done through something called the Redeemer on Cardano. Or on Ergo, it's called a context-aware. And it's the same thing. It's just data that anyone can provide into a transaction when you build it and submit it. There's some limit of data that you can provide into this.

[69:23] **MGPai**: We provide the actual data within this constraint. When you do this, that data is actually published on the blockchain. But this is a really special type of data where it's not actually in the context of the node, right? So the node doesn't know about the redeemer.

[69:46] **MGPai**: It doesn't save it for long term, but it does save it from historical transactions, right? Just in the same way that you know the transactions an address did, right? The address had an initial balance of one ERG, and then, you know, a year later, it has like a hundred. You can track that, right?

[70:05] **MGPai**: So in the same sense, you can track this data in the Redeemer context variable. So really, to summarize, you can get back the data by traversing historical transactions. So you're not trusting me at all.

[70:36] **MGPai**: All right, great. So yeah, no, just to summarize, really, the contract is something that just verifies the integrity of the provided data. And that's really the general theme of contracts on the UTXO model contracts. Position really just to verify all the data, right?

[70:53] **MGPai**: It doesn't make new data. It doesn't do anything special. It just verifies, hey, is what the transaction builder provided, is that correct? Are they like lying about something, right? Because checking something is always far cheaper than actually making it from scratch, right?

[71:12] **MGPai**: And I think that's really where UTXO shines because account model has to store all this data. I mean, sure, it's easier for developers, but these node sizes are ridiculous. I can't run a three terabyte node in my basement just for Ethereum. And that's just Ethereum.

[71:27] **MGPai**: You have all these forks, right? If I want to expand to multi-chain, I have to spin up like an Ethereum node, a Binance node, Polygon node, and so on, right? If I want to do the things the right way and not, you know, buy like a subscription to an RPC, right?

[71:44] **MGPai**: And it's not scalable, but in my basement, I can run an Ergo node, which has what, like 20 gigs, 30 gigs? It's nothing, right? Flash Drive has more storage than that. And Cardano node, right? Cardano node was like 160 gigabytes. I can run plenty of these compared to just one Ethereum node.

[72:04] **MGPai**: So you can see the trade-offs here. They really shine in the long run.

[72:13] **MGPai**: So really the final slide here is improvements made to the original protocol, right? So the original contract was short-lived and static. So like I said, it was originally meant for like things like meme coins, right? So where you just don't want people to sell, right? You don't really think about long-term.

[72:35] **MGPai**: And the problem with this was it was very static. So you have one emission rate for the whole program. So what I also added to the protocol itself, not the UTXO implementation, is I made the emissions very dynamic.

[72:56] **MGPai**: So like every epoch, for example, on Palm staking every week, people can claim their rewards. This emission amount can fluctuate without having to redeploy the contract or get people to migrate. And this is really cool because a dynamic protocol allows us to easily curb any excess inflation or incentivizes staking during steep price movements.

[73:23] **MGPai**: So it allows us for more of a fine-grained control rather than... So, you know, we actually react to how the economy is doing. I mean, you saw yesterday that, you know, things went crazy. So maybe during a time like that, you want to incentivize people to hold, right?

[73:40] **MGPai**: So maybe we'll tell them, okay, we can increase inflation so that, you know, people hold on to their palms instead of selling it on the market just for no reason right when everything's going crazy right so then people might not sell because they'll say hey like I can just put in the contract I believe in Palm I believe in this tokens future right I believe in crypto so like maybe in a next week you're not going to the tariffs are going to be reversed and we won't have an issue.

[74:10] **MGPai**: So maybe I want to hold my Palm and make some more Palm and money instead of selling, right? So the dynamic protocol really allows for this. Yeah, that's it for staking. So hopefully that was some presentation that you could understand. I tried to make it as least technical as possible so everyone can enjoy. So any other questions?

[74:41] **MGPai**: Yeah, so it's quite technical, but you can think of, really, on the actual usage-wise, rather than the data structure implementation-wise, kushti mentioned that the AVLG is actually a lot more efficient compared to the Merkle-Patricia trie that you have on Cardano.

[75:05] **MGPai**: Meaning the proof sizes, the really efficient means that you can do more operations in a given transaction. The proof sizes are smaller. The data that you provide during transaction building, it's a lot smaller. What does it mean for the end user? It means that transactions really will be cheaper.

[75:28] **MGPai**: But there is a significant implementation difference, how it works internally. But I don't really know that from the top of my head, and I can't speak for it that much. But in the context of this, though, you can think of it as interchangeable.

[76:33] **MGPai**: Correct, correct. So, Grayman brought up a great point. So yesterday, again, I don't think everyone's quite active on Twitter, but Liquid, so there's a protocol on Cardano called Liquid Finance and it's a lending protocol. And what they did yesterday was because of the extreme movement.

[77:03] **MGPai**: So I think Cardano literally went from like 80 cents to like 27 cents in like a flash because of like mass liquidations. So Liquid Finance is a decentralized lending platform, right? So you provide some collateral in ADA and you get back an asset. So since the price moved down so steeply, you're going to have some liquidations due to that.

[77:24] **MGPai**: So Liquid Finance completely shut off their front-end interface and you can't manage your liquidations now right no one can liquidate you or anything and you can't make new collateral requests and so on I don't I don't know why they did this I mean obviously to protect people from being hurt but like I don't know I think everyone's like a grown man here and can handle their finances so I think that's kind of silly but it is what it is so yes, they disabled the front end.

[77:59] **MGPai**: And maybe that I can make a custom transaction using code to interact with the contracts. But I actually found Cardano's very funny. A lot of these off-chain runners, so basically what processes your transactions with the main contract, they're actually permissioned.

[78:20] **MGPai**: So for people to run the off-chain bots, you need to have like maybe you have to own you have to be the owner of a certain address right so only your private key can actually run the transactions but what's more common is like it's like a special NFT right it's all NFT holders are the ones that can run these off chain right that and that's a very it's not decentralized at all it's just made on a decentralized platform.

[78:50] **MGPai**: So really, this is a very simple check, right? Like you have a contract, right? And you're like, okay, all these calculations happen. It's decentralized. But you add just one tiny check. Only the owner, only the holder of this NFT can run the transaction, right?

[79:06] **MGPai**: So technically, no. For a lot of protocols on Cardano, no. You can't just bypass everything and build your own transactions with code. I can't do that because I don't own that special NFT that you need to actually process the transactions.

[79:23] **MGPai**: And no, this is actually like really bad. I don't know why. It's like a very common on Cardano. But yeah, no, it's not really decentralized. It's the answer.

[79:52] **MGPai**: Again, as Joe kept mentioning, know your assumptions. It's something permissioned. For example, we have the HODLerg game. It's all open source. So if the front end shut off, first of all, you can just spin up your own front end because the code is all there.

[80:06] **MGPai**: Second, you can build your own custom transaction and you can run your own off-chain because all that code is open source. It's not hiding anything and you don't need any special NFT. Even on Cardano, if these projects are all open source, even if the off-chain is all open source, the website is all open source, it doesn't matter because you need the NFT to actually run the off-chain.

[80:27] **MGPai**: It's literally not going to work. So it's decentralized, it's open source, but you can't do anything.

[80:50] **MGPai**: Oh, no, that's a great question. Maybe we can talk to Allison, who's in the back. He's the Nautilus developer. But what Grayman said is, hey, can we have a HODLerg natively within the Nautilus wallet itself? And I think that's really cool.

[81:08] **MGPai**: Maybe we can have a dedicated apps section on Nautilus wallet. I think it's already there with SigUSD. But I think a bunch of apps within Nautilus, so you don't have to go to any website. Right, you you're actually technically running your own front end right because it's a wallet extension so you're not even reliant on me hosting the website.

[81:26] **MGPai**: So I think that's a great idea and we can have like a bunch of apps on Nautilus where just click like two buttons and you know you interact with the protocol. I really like this idea because again you're not worried about any front-end, right? If a front-end gets hacked, what a front-end being hacked means is that someone takes ownership of the domain that it's on, right?

[81:49] **MGPai**: And injects custom code. So maybe they made an exact replica of my front-end. And then they're like, hey, when you click this Mint button, instead of minting, you're transferring all your ERG to an address, right? That's what a hack really means.

[82:05] **MGPai**: So this isn't really possible if you have something running on your own instance, like on Nautilus itself. I mean, it's only possible if you literally physically download a virus, and maybe the virus does some magic where it has control of Nautilus. But in general hacks, if my website gets hacked, that's not going to affect your Nautilus, which is running its own app instance of HODLerg.

[82:29] **MGPai**: So that's a wonderful idea. We should definitely get that going. All right, any other questions, comments?

[82:44] **MGPai**: Yes, yes, it's live on Cardano. And yeah, it's called Palm-economy.io. And you can find information about it. And it's specifically staking for Palm Token, which is the token for Zengate's Palmyra RWA platform.

[83:07] **MGPai**: So currently there is no plans to do it on Ergo and it's not up to me right but in the future the point is that it's pretty straightforward right because now that it's done on Cardano everything maps directly to Ergo right so since all the theories studies the theory guys is what takes a long time right getting it done right planning it out implementation is pretty straightforward once you have this theory, right?

[83:31] **MGPai**: So that's why EVM is so successful because you already it's been there since what 2015 and you have so many contracts So guess what a new fork a new L2 Base has their own block coinbase has their own blockchain you take the contracts and you copy paste it always literally copy paste and so in a similar sense, since we already have everything ready on Cardano, when we're ready for Ergo, we can just take that code and translate it over to Ergo.

[83:58] **MGPai**: So it's much more trivial compared to making it from scratch.

[84:08] **MGPai**: Yes, it's all very similar. It's not exactly copy-paste, because on Ethereum, it's literally a fork of the node. It's the exact same thing. So you can actually copy-paste the exact code and deploy it on L2s and so on. So that's not the case for UTXO. So you can't copy-paste it.

[84:26] **MGPai**: But the overall idea maps directly. So you're just translating whatever Cardano smart contract language to ErgoScript exactly. There's less friction. There's I mean, there's more friction than going from like Ethereum to like an Ethereum fork, but from like a conceptually, it's like the same because the architecture is the same. Yeah cheese.

[84:58] **MGPai**: Yeah, I would definitely use AVL because it's built into the contract, right? They both serve that same abstract need of storing data off-chain and then verification on-chain, right? That's really the important part. That's the only thing that really makes this work. So AVL tree serves the same purpose. So there's no reason to have to use a Merkle-Patricia trie on Ergo.

[85:37] **MGPai**: So actually, no, it's already decentralized in the sense that you can traverse through Ergo Explorer and you can get back that original data, the non-hashed data. And it's actually even better than IPFS because you don't have to do any pinning or anything. So it's actually all there on Ergo already.

[85:58] **MGPai**: But the actual raw data that you probably were thinking about is the tree data and the balance data. And that cannot be stored on IPFS or something, because it's something that requires a database, because you're doing database operations.

[86:22] **MGPai**: All right. Thanks for tuning in, guys.

[116:58] **Luca**: Hi everyone, I'm Luca and I'm going to talk about GluonW, which is a cryptocurrency stablecoin protocol. Just to start off, I just want to acknowledge the people that were involved with writing the paper. The first is Bruno, who came
