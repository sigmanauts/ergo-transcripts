# Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA - May 1st, 2025

## Executive Summary

This community call covered significant technical progress on Ergo's development roadmap, with kushti reporting on the finalization of version 6.0 (16-17k lines of code) currently under review, and substantial progress on sub-blocks implementation including peer-to-peer layer improvements and transaction validation. The discussion revealed growing real-world adoption interest, including conversations with African government representatives about tokenizing minerals and funding cooperatives, demonstrating Ergo's potential for grassroots financial applications.

The call also featured practical adoption updates, with qx() reporting successful expansion of the BRIC token recycling program at Cornell (60-70 students now participating, saving students ~$1,000), and MGPai sharing insights from cross-chain development experience, highlighting Ergo's superior developer tooling compared to Cardano despite the latter's much larger market cap. The conversation emphasized Ergo's unique position for real-world use cases through its UTXO model, storage rent mechanism, and affordable transaction fees.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Technical Development Progress**: Version 5.0.26 under review with block candidate regeneration support; Version 6.0 finalized with 16-17k lines of code awaiting final audit
• **Sub-blocks Implementation**: Peer-to-peer layer messages completed, proper validation implemented, backward compatibility maintained for all pre-sub-blocks clients
• **Real-World Adoption**: African government discussions about mineral tokenization and funding models for mining cooperatives
• **BRIC Token Success**: Cornell recycling program expanded to 60-70 students, demonstrating practical cryptocurrency usage in institutional settings
• **Cross-Chain Development Comparison**: MGPai's experience building on Cardano vs Ergo revealed superior tooling and libraries despite Ergo's smaller size
• **Storage and Data Solutions**: Discussion of on-chain data storage capabilities, including encrypted password storage possibilities using Ergo's 4KB box limit
• **Future Development Focus**: Post-sub-blocks roadmap discussions focusing on improving developer experience and real-world needs

## Decisions Made

• Version 5.0.26 to be released first before 6.0 deployment
• Approach mining pools to begin voting process for 6.0 activation (requires 90% super majority)
• Schedule additional community chats for Friday-Sunday to discuss post-sub-blocks development priorities
• kushti to participate in industry media Twitter Spaces event on Wednesday
• Continue weekly Thursday AMA format

## Notable Quotes

**kushti**: "It's the moment when we have cryptocurrencies going into corporate and national reserves. At the same time, tokenization of real-world assets. Well, I see a new wave of demands for privacy... there is even a particular interest in proof of work again I believe right well in certain circles."

**MGPai**: "It's honestly quite ridiculous Cardano being a multi-billion dollar blockchain and then tooling just you know being all over the place... It's quite impressive what Ergo has managed to do while being a fraction of the size of Cardano."

**qx()**: "I can't imagine building what I built here in this system for students with Ethereum or even Cardano. It would be impossible. I can do an initial airdrop of brick to students and give them 0.1 ERG, and they're set for 10, 15 transactions done each."
