# Ergo Community Call Summary - July 11, 2025

## Executive Summary

The weekly Ergo community call featured significant updates on the 6.0 upgrade voting progress, with 97% of miners voting in favor of the proposal. Kushti, speaking from Dubai, provided insights into upcoming developments including sub-blocks implementation, Oracle 2.0 for SigmaUSD, and the announcement of "Braid" - a double merge-mined Bitcoin-Ergo sidechain project. The discussion emphasized moving beyond theoretical capabilities to practical application deployment, with several existing tools like SigmaLock, MewMart, and DAO tooling ready for wider adoption.

Key technical milestones include plans to introduce sub-blocks supporting mining nodes to the public testnet by late July, and the potential upgrade of SigmaUSD to Oracle 2.0 following successful Dexy testing. The community also discussed expanding decentralized infrastructure through a peer-to-peer node hosting initiative and preparations for the upcoming Colorado meetup in October.

## Key Discussion Points

• **6.0 Upgrade Progress**: 97% miner approval rate with successful implementation of 6.1 on peer-to-peer explorers
• **Sub-blocks Development**: DevNet seed nodes updated with testnet integration planned for late July
• **Oracle 2.0 Upgrade**: SigmaUSD Oracle pool upgrade in development following successful Dexy testing
• **Braid Sidechain**: New double merge-mined Bitcoin-Ergo sidechain project announced by Better Money Labs
• **Application Focus**: Emphasis on deploying existing tools (SigmaLock, MewMart, DAO tooling) rather than building new ones
• **Merge-mined Sidechains**: Development planning for Rust-based sidechain implementations
• **Testnet Mining**: Need for additional testnet miners to support sub-blocks testing
• **P2P Infrastructure**: Community initiative to distribute decentralized node hosting globally
• **Colorado Meetup**: October event planning with hackathon and live streaming components

## Decisions Made

• Sub-blocks will be integrated into public testnet by late July 2025
• SigmaUSD Oracle pool will be upgraded to version 2.0 with expanded Oracle set (up to 15 oracles)
• P2P infrastructure machines will be built and distributed to 4-5 community volunteers
• Merge-mined sidechain development will proceed in Rust programming language
• Community hackathon topic will be decided by vote with results revealed during the October meetup

## Notable Quotes

> "I believe in most cases, it's about simple stuff. Just people need to start using it." - **kushti** on application deployment priorities

> "I think the blockchain enables people to charge for proper effort... I think we should see more competitiveness in these scenes to kind of get the price of things truer to the total effort." - **qx()** on blockchain's potential for fair pricing

> "Ergo is especially about competitive capitalism, right, because, well, there are no free money here, right, to sponsor, like, parasitic activities, basically." - **kushti** on Ergo's economic model
