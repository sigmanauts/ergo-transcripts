      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "The final 6.0 release should happen today along with instructions for mining pools. This is significant because the latest soft fork was in 2022, and many mining pools have likely forgotten the process. The 6.0 update is a soft fork that has been in development since 2024, followed by work on sub-blocks.",

      "asker": "community member",
      "answer": "It depends on how you define 'private'. You could whitelist off-chain batchers and use encrypted requests. However, the devil is in the details - centralized quasi-private solutions might give a central entity control over MEV without being traced. The most efficient designs involve batchers with encrypted requests and commitments.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "If slippage is large, bots can do separate transactions with slightly higher fees. It's not quite different from account-based chains with AMMs. However, you can avoid sandwich attacks by using direct execution instead of proxy contracts, like Spectrum DEX does with Dexy, making it impossible to insert orders before yours.",

More detailed documents could be created, and kushti is happy to cooperate with anyone who has ideas for merge mined sidechains. This approach enables two-way trustless pegging, which isn't possible with Bitcoin.",
