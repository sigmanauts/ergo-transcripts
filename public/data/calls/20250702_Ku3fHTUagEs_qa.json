We are pretty much on track for starting to inject sub-blocks supporting mining nodes into the public test nets from around July 15th to 25th.",

      "answer": "I think it's better to move gradually and always try to do things in a soft-forkable fashion, so not rejecting the old nodes so that they have the right to validate the network. In most cases, it's always worth to have old validators. We can do hundreds of different things in regards with optimizations and building around.",

It looked interesting and I think Ergo is a great use case for more super intelligent type of mechanisms, especially with the cheap transaction rates. You could have AI agents running on chain with tokens where they pay themselves to do different tasks - one agent does task A, another does task B, and they can rent each other or have humans hire them.",

The follow-up transactions are basically about sending voting tokens to yes or no addresses like you did with initial voting procedures. You can use stealth addresses and then the link is broken, providing anonymity.",
