[00:20] **qx()**: Good morning, kushti.

[00:23] **kushti**: Hello. How's it going?

[00:26] **kushti**: Good, good. Good morning. Yeah, you have a good morning.

[00:33] **qx()**: Yeah. I cashed out everything. I'm totally out of the game and I bought a private yacht. I'm out here on the ocean. Just kidding.

[00:42] **qx()**: Yeah, good morning. I'm with my family on a vacation for the week at a beautiful lake. I'm up before everybody else up on the roof of one of the houses and just joining the AMA to talk about Ergo today, kushti, how about you?

[00:59] **kushti**: Yeah, so hot here and yeah well doing a bit slowly due to weather and the location so I'm back from Dubai. So in Dubai it was especially hard to work.

[01:23] **qx()**: It's gotta seem cold where you are now compared to Dubai.

[01:23] **kushti**: Yeah, indeed. Probably like most places of the planet, right? It's quite cold in comparison. But anyway, so they're doing a lot of things. So working for 6.0, working with Machina in turn, then continuing some blogs.

[01:57] **kushti**: While polishing things, improving consent. And yeah, well, I think we can do public testnet mining sub-blocks supporting nodes in July. Then writing a white paper for first merge mined sidechain. So something like that.

[02:26] **qx()**: When is voting done, kushti?

[02:29] **kushti**: So it seems there is 90 plus percent support. So then we will see 6.0 activation around October. And yeah, we can think about sub-blocks after. So yeah well let's try public testnet first and then consider mainnet activation time frame.

[03:04] **qx()**: That'll be good. Is there any what's it called? I remember there was talk about not a hackathon, but maybe a mini hackathon where projects that are more open source could be funded to integrate sub-blocks into them. Things that maybe don't have a hosted interface, those kind of things could be modified to support sub-blocks.

[03:29] **qx()**: So that would be something interesting that could happen in the future for the community members looking to bolster some of those projects. I'm sure things like Mew and Nautilus and those kind of things, those devs will update it themselves if they feel free to take part in that kind of thing.

[03:50] **kushti**: Yeah, so I think it's mostly about DEXes, right? And applications like that, which will be boosted mostly. So I believe that for auctions, two blocks are okay, right? Then for bonds and so on. So for loans even, right?

[04:14] **kushti**: So when you can provide a loan to some farmers in Kenya in like two minutes, then it's already quite... That's not fast enough, kushti. It's already quite mind-blowing, right? So you can do that in like two seconds instead of two minutes.

[04:42] **kushti**: It's not really changing anything because anyway, they will cash it out in like two days after. They need to reach some peer-to-peer exchange booth. So some middlemen in the town nearby. So yeah, something like that.

[05:03] **kushti**: But for DEXes, right, so for things we are completely virtual. Yeah, maybe. That doesn't matter.

[05:15] **qx()**: And I think if people have... Yeah, so if people have, I think it should be enabled by default, actually. In Nautilus, if people have enable zero config turned on, it shows transactions before they're settled in your wallet.

[05:37] **qx()**: So from a UX standpoint, it brings a point of more instantaneous transfers when you're working on the DEXes or when you're trying to transfer things to somebody. And with chain TXs, I mean, we're not talking about finality here, but we're talking about user experience.

[05:56] **qx()**: It really feels the same when I'm bombing through a DEX swap and then I'm sending that, like when I had to exit through SimpleSwap or Rosen Bridge to pull some funds out for funding something for Sigmanauts.

[06:10] **qx()**: Just using that, you could just chain some transactions together. And for the UX experience with zero config, it felt instantaneous, right? But overall I had to wait the blocks to do it in the background. So yeah, that's interesting.

[06:24] **qx()**: I wonder if, applied by default, kushti, if that would have a speed mentality increase for the users that are new here in Ergo. Essentially, they might not be able to understand chain transactions, but if to them it looks like they do a swap, oh, their funds are already there, oh, I could spend those funds somewhere else.

[06:46] **qx()**: Do they need to dig in to know that chain transactions, that's how it's working in the background, or finality, the difference between the two? I don't know.

[06:54] **kushti**: Yeah, but I think in 2025, what users are mostly paying attention to is distribution of token, right? Because it seems more and more are centralized trash coins, right? So it's a little bit different environment than in 2024.

[07:27] **kushti**: First, they tried to find some existing meme coins, but meme coins are also well-scheming, like all of them.

[07:42] **qx()**: The thing that gets me is people at central exchanges that have grown the culture in the environment right now in mainstream crypto and then you see them bitching on chain online but on Twitter or other places about how you need serious projects and utility and things like that.

[08:10] **qx()**: I'm like guys, you spend years just soaking money out of these rug pulls and community and now you're like, oh we need crypto that actually does something. But also they just talking right. So when you see what they're doing here, it's somewhat different also.

[08:47] **kushti**: Yeah, so for sidechains development, yeah, well, I will share first updates. Well, in the coming weeks, probably, we can start to do such things. So currently, there is a repository stop, right, and white paper and progress spots.

[09:19] **kushti**: Yeah, well, with like a few developers, we can accelerate things greatly. Then yeah what else so a lot of things going on no not just about sub-blocks right and well I don't know so this is quite important thing right but yeah, well, in 2025, it seems that there are a lot of important things.

[09:57] **kushti**: Well, people do pay attention to things like distribution and so on.

[10:06] **qx()**: So I think that stuff is somewhat picking up. Yeah, it's slow. Not as fast as you'd like right, but I don't know. I think people are ignorant to on purpose, right? They'll claim for that. They'll claim to start looking into fair distribution, miner rights, those kind of things and then at the same time.

[10:25] **qx()**: It's like the distracted girlfriend meme where you're walking along with fair distribution and open source and peer to peer and then four coin walks by and jerk your head to take a peek kind of thing.

[10:40] **qx()**: So I feel that stuff's always tempting with the majority of the ecosystem, unfortunately. But I mean, the trick is to be steady, be strong and continue to build like we're doing and exhibiting the proper principles that matter all along.

[11:02] **qx()**: Oh, another news, kushti. Drama. We need to have our feature drama today. So our drama of the week is, if you guys remember, I told Joe to go break something last week. Well, he broke his own Twitter account. He got banned somehow. So Joe is officially banned off Twitter again. He's going to have to make a new account and get it back. We'll see how long that takes him.

[11:25] **kushti**: But wait, so it's Joe's personal account, which is bad.

[11:29] **qx()**: Joe's personal account. We don't dare give him the main account anymore, kushti. It's too dangerous. So he's trying to get that back. We'll see how long that takes. But yeah, maybe they'll let him broadcast out of Rosen Bridge for now. We'll see.

[11:50] **qx()**: Alright, what else is new, kushti? Any news on Ergo Raffle 2.0? Is that still kicking around at some point for a release?

[11:59] **kushti**: Oh, Raffle? I don't know. I need to check with the guys. Not recently. Let me check. So yeah, we now have a DAO, right? DAO breach. So we do. Bring DAO if you have. So we need now for LPs, right? And we'll start to do things.

[12:33] **qx()**: Yep. So Joe's team is working on Hummingbot, which hopefully should help with a lot of community run LP. So I feel that's going to be a really nice change as opposed to large finances popping an LP that can pop and remove them just as easy as they put them there.

[12:54] **qx()**: It's going to be nice to see bridge liquidity spread across ecosystems with community-run liquidity. I think that's the best option, spread it out. Not only spread out the liquidity to different bridges, but you're also spreading it out.

[13:07] **qx()**: So if I put in $500 into liquidity across with Hummingbot, and kushti puts in $1,000, and it just repeats that way for 5,000 users, I feel that's a better liquidity spread than a few large heavy hitters pumping in liquidity or even the project itself pumping in liquidity.

[13:32] **qx()**: It's got more lasting power. It's less big waves, more stability. So I'm really, really looking forward to that, kushti, getting that hummingbot up for Rosen.

[13:48] **kushti**: All right. And then there are some initiatives, right, from Rosen to Watson. Can you provide details?

[14:00] **qx()**: We've got to mention that again. Yeah, guys. Guys, so there are five initiatives up now in the discussion form of Paideia. And Rosen team has invited you. The Rosen guards have invited you to take part in that discussion, whether it be on the Paideia platform.

[14:20] **qx()**: We've made it a discussion, so anybody can comment on the Paideia discussions without being a member. You just need a wallet, that's it. And then Glasgow's made an article on the Ergo platform website explaining brief summaries over the positions that those five are taking and encourage discussion as well on there on the socials, telegram, discord, and Paideia as well from the website.

[14:48] **qx()**: So please guys, please, this is Ergo where we try to be as active as we can instead of being a passive. If you're an investor, instead of being passive investors, be active investors.

[15:00] **qx()**: Take your Sunday morning coffee and read one of those proposals per day and put a comment. Even if you like, that looks great, Joe's a genius, I love what Joe's saying here, I don't disagree with anything. Just put a little thumbs up in the discussion there, just so we see that engagement and we get those reality checks and those sanity checks.

[15:26] **qx()**: So engage, even if it's positive. And of course, engage if it's negative too. If there's something that you're like, this is not going to work because of this, or I think there's a better way than engage. Let's be a chain full of engagers, guys. Let's do that, please.

[15:43] **qx()**: So those are from Paideia. If you can't find them, go to the Ergo Platform website or check out a couple posts before on the Twitter page, on our Twitter account, the Ergo Platform Twitter account. We've got them all listed there with links to all the proposals.

[16:01] **qx()**: So that's, for those not aware of what those are, there's several different options across the five of them. One of them is specifically what a lot of you are interested in, and that is getting Rosen-ERG in the hands of many, many people on the Cardano chains via airdrops, via pickups, those kind of things.

[16:26] **qx()**: And the idea there would be to create a wallet threshold of holders on Cardano so that Kraken, with their latest arbitrarily statement of how many wallets it takes to get listed, will hopefully meet that goal and initiate a listing on Kraken with at least Rosen ERG for starters.

[16:47] **qx()**: So please read those proposals, comment, even if that's the only proposal you comment on, just show some initiative and engagement and hop in there and do that, please.

[17:03] **kushti**: All right. So how things are going with Sigmanauts and just so, well, InfraDAO proposal. So we will check after the.

[17:14] **qx()**: Yeah, I just pushed out a little update of some more details about the InfraDAO. We've got enough people for the initial machine handout. We've got four or five people interested. So for those people, I'm hard baking a machine, cloning it from the three machines that are running right now in the InfraDAO, and we'll ship them out.

[17:36] **qx()**: They'll hook them up. We'll point the load balancers to them based on their internet connection bandwidth, what percentage we'll point to them. Once those are running and everything's working well, then we will start opening up to other people.

[17:49] **qx()**: We'll say, hey, if you have this much bandwidth, if you have this kind of machine and this much RAM and this much storage, and you have an external facing IP, you can open up ports, you can run a little command line and configs and those kind of things, then please join the DAO.

[18:06] **qx()**: And then we'll eventually, hopefully, have the full circumference of the globe mapped out with ergo nodes so that if you're in Africa and you're trying to submit a transaction or go through the Explorer. You're actually hitting an Explorer that's on your continent or that kind of thing.

[18:30] **qx()**: So that's the end goal there as well as of course taking the responsibility away from the EF so they don't have to keep bleeding money into unofficially hosted ergo-infra-DAO. But excited about that. That's gonna be great. We'll make nodes great again, kushti.

[18:49] **kushti**: So they also published some new ideas on the forum such as global transfer policies for a sidechain which is kind of a solar punk on steroids kind of idea probably but yeah I still need to explain this.

[19:10] **kushti**: Then yeah so for sub-blocks I think, well, there is need to explain how it is designed and done for more, right? So we will do it in coming weeks, maybe with some videos. Let's see. We'll try to find time for that.

[19:34] **qx()**: How's, kushti, how's any progress on ChainCash? How's that going? Is that the back burner for now?

[19:46] **kushti**: So there is some contributor which is operating the chat just today so that I'm going to review some pull requests but yeah in general so well currently the biggest obstacle is to consider some real world use case right so what could be that and well do UI's accordingly right.

[20:20] **kushti**: So well it's kind of low-level financial like primitive from meta-primitive so well it's kind of assembly language right for different financial monetary system so we need to find some concrete instantiations, right, not just to do some abstract work, right, to get done, because it's a little bit weird approach, but they're popular in crypto probably, right, just to throw something.

[21:00] **kushti**: So I think we need to go from the needs of the real world. Yeah, well, it could be done differently to change the best monitoring system from community currencies rights to some international trade currencies for corporations even states rights. Well, we need some counterparties interested in deploying all those things.

[21:47] **kushti**: Then we can do UIs. I think it's more or less straightforward once a niche is considered. We can proceed. I think it would boost the usage of ergo-escalatorial holes.

[22:10] **kushti**: Initially, we had DeFi, stablecoin, DEX, then bridge, cross-chain. Grip, right, of ERGs to collaterals of different kinds. Then, now we can do more. So, well, ergo can go into kind of treasuries, right, backing collateral, backing instruments for community trades and international trade even.

[22:55] **kushti**: So this would be quite huge, right? In comparison with DeFi sandbox. I mean, those four funny games on the blockchain.

[23:11] **qx()**: I think I'm getting rained on in a sec. We'll see what happens. Darn it. I have to go under an umbrella. What happened to, what's it called? Wasn't there somebody working on a Hawala system on Ergo? Was it Jami'i with cups of sugar somewhat?

[23:34] **kushti**: So, with Jami'i, we just did some experience. But yeah, I think Jami'i just sold some honey, right? And that's it. And he's still selling something and trying to sell something.

[23:53] **qx()**: So, what about the reverse of that, kushti? What about physical to digital conversions the other way? Not even a real pawn shop, but what if there was a way to on ramp with physical goods? Converting physical goods to digital money.

[24:11] **qx()**: So like let's say there was a shop somewhere that just like a pawn shop, but yeah I guess like a physical pawn shop that converts your goods to digital.

[24:29] **kushti**: What's the, so why do you need four Hawala like tools there?

[24:35] **qx()**: No, this is a little bit separate from Hawala tools there. It's kind of the same idea. So a trusted storefront essentially. So if there was a storefront set up to where you knew that if you sent them your old X-Box, they might give you 70% of the market value of it or 60% of the market value of it, but you would definitely get ERG sent to you as soon as it arrived and they checked it out kind of thing.

[24:59] **qx()**: So that would be, I guess a trust of Hawala would need to be there. But yeah.

[25:05] **kushti**: There is a GitCircles project from my friend, which is about creating community currencies for Git projects. For one project, you have a dedicated community currency created for contributions to open source software. Actually, he has a specification done and it will be published in the coming days. He sent me a specification a few days ago.

[25:45] **kushti**: It looks good. It will be published in the coming days. I think there are a lot of ways to use different techniques for creating different kinds of monetary financial tools, fundraising tools. So that's what we are doing.

[26:13] **kushti**: I don't know, two years to the moment, three years, but yeah, well, it's time to scale up, I guess, right, all those efforts and to do them in different environments, so digital, like those Git project currencies, right, and yeah, also physical, digital, so yeah, well, reviving.

[26:40] **kushti**: Have ideas on digital level and so on. Getting back to free banking now on digital rails.

[26:52] **qx()**: Yeah, I had an interesting conversation with somebody the other day that was visiting our place, a friend of a friend kind of thing. And with the price of certain coins going pretty high lately, everybody in your grandmother is like, should I buy? Should I buy? What should I buy? That kind of thing.

[27:11] **qx()**: So I am classically never, ever giving out advice on whatever to buy. I just speak about what we do and what others do and that kind of stuff. And that's about as much as info as I'll give people.

[27:24] **qx()**: But it was really interesting trying to talk to them about the difference between what Bitcoin is right now and what it was and what things are like the projects we work on, kushti, here in Ergo. It's really, I suggest you guys try it, people listening, try to have that conversation with people that don't know much about crypto.

[27:47] **qx()**: And it'll be an interesting one for yourself, that's for sure. They'll ask why, why are you doing this? What's the purpose of this? Why can't you just do this with other tools out there on the web and that kind of stuff.

[28:00] **qx()**: It really makes, it really hones your ability to understand why it's important to do it transparently on chain permissionless and those kinds of things. And if you do it right, you can somewhat convince the other people that it makes sense. So it's a very interesting conversation.

[28:16] **kushti**: Yeah. So I think with global transfer policies, it could be made quite clear, right? So well, the idea is that then everyone can run on CBDC basically, right? So well, fully controlled monitoring circuit, right?

[28:37] **kushti**: And then the question, the only question here remains if this kind of tooling per se is permissionless, right? Because if not, if consensus is permissioned, right? To some degree, maybe to any degree even.

[29:02] **kushti**: So then you are ending up with some kind of dystopia, right? It's like CBDC is not for everyone, right? Only for central banks and their friends. So for some foundation, right? Shady foundation, controlling some digital private currency basically with tooling on top of it.

[29:30] **kushti**: But yeah so if it's about permissionless environment right and then it's not so big deal right it's not so disturbing I guess if like everyone can do on monetary circuits right if you even if they are closed or well like have some kind of control even full control of all the operations right so still well if it's a tooling available to like everyone then what's the issue so then it's done.

[30:29] **kushti**: Okay. And that's basically what do you have in all the cryptocurrency, right? But now it's made to extreme just, right? So we already have stable coins with black lists, right? So we have certain cryptocurrencies even applying blacklists, right, on the consensus level.

[30:55] **kushti**: So then there is need to define, right, when it's not going to be harmful to everyone, right. And I think it's about that. It could be about that after all. So you need for permissionless consensus, right?

[31:27] **qx()**: Right. And I think in this conversation, I had the kind of sticking point, not sticking point, but the thing that was really attractive to this person was the fact that you go to a bank and you say, look, I'm renting for $2,000 a month this apartment.

[31:42] **qx()**: I'd like to buy a house and my payment is $1,700 a month with this loan in your interest. And the bank's like, nah, I'm sorry. No thanks. Kind of thing. And you're like, look, I have the collateral lives and I have the income level here to pay $2,000 a month just fine. Why aren't you letting me buy a house for $1,700 a month lending me?

[32:08] **qx()**: So I think what attracted about this in this conversation to this guy about Ergo, at least, is that crypto in general, is that those kind of things are contract based permissionless, right? I said you can go to SigmaFi. Let's say ERG is dipping and you want to take out a loan of SigmaUSD so you can reinvest or whatnot?

[32:31] **qx()**: And I said you just go to a website I said you put up your collateral choose your own interest and make it juicy enough for somebody to jump into and you click a button I said the contract collects your funds and post it up there for somebody to see and then even on top of that the attractive thing was like you know what happens if like my freaking bank just went through a name change right like what a pain in the ass the apps change everything changes it's just a bunch of bullcrap.

[33:09] **qx()**: I said, with this kind of stuff on chain and permissionless, it doesn't matter. I said, you could either pay a couple hundred bucks to a dev to spin one up from the GitHub or have ChatGPT help you out, spin it up on your own machine to spin up the front end interface.

[33:24] **qx()**: Go ahead and liquidate the loan kind of thing or repay your loan based on that. The idea that finance is unstoppable, private, but also transparent and in your own control, I think is something that hopefully more and more people wake up to every day.

[33:43] **kushti**: Yeah, yeah. And so you can do also your own currency, like QXUSD, right, with your own rules. Well, your community may have very different rules, which could be OK for your community, for example, maybe restrictive for others. But why should you care, right, if it's just, well.

[34:12] **qx()**: Right, I could see bad things happening too, kushti, though. I could see corporations inventing their own, or minting their own stable coin, paying their employees in their own stable coin, and not letting, and nobody else really accepting it on a further basis, so that you have to kind of buy things at your own place.

[34:29] **qx()**: That happened in the US. They call them, what was it, wooden nickels back in the day, right? Or something town, what was it called? That miner town where they paid them in their own currency and then you could only spend that currency on rent and at the general store in the miners town so you basically had nothing at the end of it you were enslaved.

[34:47] **kushti**: Right so yeah I mean that's quite a common story happened around the world. Yeah, so around late 19th century. Yeah, it was quite common I believe around the globe right to have this kind of factory currency. So you're selling it and then buy only in factory store. But Rosen Bridge to the rescue right let's bring him on to another chain pull that liquidity off and.

[35:24] **qx()**: But yeah, I mean, evil is going to exist either way. What have we got for questions?

[35:29] **kushti**: I mean, at least you have here freedom to switch right to another currency just in a matter of seconds. I mean to work for another currency at least, right? You spare time and then to switch completely.

[35:49] **qx()**: Right, and it's not difficult for other entities to accept that kind of digital currency as compared to in the past where it was a wooden nickel or something like that.

[36:01] **kushti**: Yes, so I think in comparison with late 19th century here, environment here is quite different.

[36:10] **qx()**: I could see Amazon blacklisting the hell out of there.

[36:16] **kushti**: Right, right. But then you can blacklist Amazon dollars, right, also in your financial circuit. So it could be, then very fragmented. But also, also, you are not so controlled. I mean, not so everything can be controlled at least, right?

[36:48] **kushti**: Unlike ubiquitous financial systems, especially digital ones. Yeah, let's see. But hopefully, it would be better when you can have freedom to make your own contractual, for financial contracts, contractual monetary circuit, stuff like that.

[37:28] **qx()**: I think it's brilliant for companies to come out with their own stable issued coins, right?

[37:34] **kushti**: That's what they're already doing, right?

[37:38] **qx()**: No, no, I think it's great. I think if they want to give the community, not the community, if they want to give investors an opportunity to hold something stable that is a belief in that company's ability to maintain a stable, then by all means, go for it. That's great. You know might get some competition to well, I mean everything's pegged to the damn dollar, but be nice.

[38:08] **qx()**: kushti, we got a question for you ready. All right. It's from Alex T. Co-mining with Bitcoin. Can you speak to this a bit? They feel huge potential to integrate with existing BTC farms and act as a co-mine smart layer. I know you and Joe are talking about this quite a bit. Can you go into detail at all on how that would work?

[38:29] **kushti**: What's kind of mining with Bitcoin? Sorry.

[38:34] **qx()**: So essentially co-mining an ergo sidechain with Bitcoin on ASIC miners, I guess, would be the question.

[38:42] **kushti**: But yeah, so currently the idea is to have double merge mined sidechain rights with design like Ergo, right? So inputted and ordering blocks, like after sub-blocks. But ordering blocks are committed on Bitcoin blockchain, right?

[38:59] **kushti**: And they're also committing to additional data structures for Bitcoin blockchain, such as digest of Bitcoin UTXO set, including OP_RETURN outputs and also we can add NIPoPoWs of their right for Bitcoin blockchain.

[39:23] **kushti**: So then with that data committed by a subset of Bitcoin miners, you can have access in different contracts so to bitcoin you take source right so you can do rgb like protocols you can have NIPoPoW clients for bitcoin right and so on then yeah you also have input blocks which are committed on ergo blockchain so on ergo input blocks.

[39:58] **kushti**: Then yeah like every block in double-merged mine sidechain is proof-of-work backed. Also, the state from both blockchains are brought to that sidechain to be used in DeFi, so it's about trustless back with Ergo. As shown in ErgoHack 7 submission.

[40:28] **kushti**: Then it could be trustless pack with Bitcoin using Bitcoin bridge. How do they call it? Bridgeless, something like that. So B2M2 based. It seems B2M3 is broken at the moment. But for B2M2 there are already a few competing implementations.

[41:00] **kushti**: And then so then you may have trustless transfers with two blockchains, right? Well, a possibility to use all the ergo, almost all the ergo DeFi tooling right on this side chain and so on. So would be a good solution for Bitcoin DeFi, I believe.

[41:32] **qx()**: Very cool. Yeah, I won't say it. No, I'll move on. I won't say it. We'll keep going. Let's see what else we have. Is it raining on your site? No, it's not raining yet. It's a big everybody. It's a very pretty lake that I'm at, but it's going to rain in like 10 minutes.

[41:58] **qx()**: No, it's going to rain at 11. I think I have another hour before it rains because she should be safe. All right. All right, let's see Oh, Richie's getting more specific is there a double merge mining are there double merge mining coins in existence? How can you solve a block for Autolykos and SHA-256 with a single hash calculation.

[42:27] **kushti**: Oh. But so well Bitcoin miners are working on Bitcoin mining along with Bitcoin merged, let's say, blocks, while ergo miners are working on ergo mining along with ergo merged blocks on that sidechain. So they just need to read data from other blocks to refer to them.

[43:04] **kushti**: About other implementations, I'm not actually quite sure. Need to check. Yeah, maybe not even, so it would be the first one.

[43:26] **qx()**: We've got a question from Hermes, and that is, can you explain Lithos like I'm a dummy? ELI-5, Lithos, kushti.

[43:35] **kushti**: So, Lithos is decentralized mining protocol. So it's kind of a decentralized pool, which is backed by contracts on ergo or blockchain. But also that's done efficiently, right? So well, in a rollup like way.

[44:03] **qx()**: So well, look at these things. Look at those old boats. Aren't those beautiful? Where's my finger? Yeah. There we go. There we go. There's a whole house of them. Yeah, these old like boats from the turn of the century, kind of these woodies they call them.

[44:18] **qx()**: Yeah, so essentially it's finding a way to instead of current mining is done by reporting to a local server on a pool and solve that way. But right, Lithos integrates putting your effort proof on chain itself by the individual miner.

[44:39] **kushti**: And also it's efficient, so there were some attempts to do contract-based decentralized mining pools for Ethereum, but it was just some theoretical paper. Done like eight years ago and so for bitcoin they had a p2p pool but it was kind of sidechain for bitcoin and it wasn't big but also wasn't efficient right for miners to work with dedicated sidechain for pooled mining just.

[45:25] **kushti**: So here are also efficient.

[45:34] **qx()**: We've got, we've got saying how easy will it be to build with the sigma chain? Will there be a modular templates? It's a kind of like pump fun where you can push and pump out your own side chain.

[45:47] **kushti**: Right, so yeah, there will be some library available to easily build merge mined sidechains. So then it would be the question also how to make miners, mining pools to pick them easily, right? Because you can launch sidechain, but if it's merged mine, then it should be supported by mining pools.

[46:15] **kushti**: Then there is need for some easy tool for mining puzzles, right? And we will do that. So it should be like UI, right? Where they just, pick chains they like and mine them along with them.

[46:32] **qx()**: That'd be cool, the era of pump fun mining, where instead of pumping fun and hitting a liquidity pool with the tokens and having people buy them, you're trying to entice GPU miners to mine your chain. As you put it, that'd be really damn cool to see, kushti.

[46:48] **kushti**: Yeah, the biggest meme coin is mineable, right? It's actually a merge mined side chain of Litecoin. Right, so the Dogecoin, which I'm talking about, is a merge mined side chain of Litecoin. And it's bigger by market capitalization than the home chain, right, the main chain, than the Litecoin itself.

[47:18] **kushti**: But it's also helping Litecoin a lot, I believe, because at least for security budget, it is helping a lot, right, to Litecoin. And actually before Dogecoin there were a few other merge mined sidechains of meme kind so it was bells then cats and then Dogecoin after cats but somehow Dogecoin became popular and bells and cats not.

[48:01] **kushti**: But yeah, I believe Bells was the first meme sidechain. But with programmable money capabilities, you can do a lot, actually, also, right? So you can launch your meme sidechain, but also you have, some rules of your own, right, for this sidechain.

[48:31] **kushti**: But what could that be about, I need to think. Yeah, could be something funny, right, if it's meme. Yeah, of course.

[48:44] **qx()**: All right, let's see. We've got Luke saying, would it be worthwhile to extend Nautilus and become multi-chain if it also has Bitcoin and Cardano natives, then it may attract new users and make an interesting interface for Rosen. I had thought Nautilus's mission was to follow Rosen, or maybe that was Minotaur, but I thought it was Nautilus as well.

[49:03] **qx()**: I'm pretty sure that's what it was. kushti, is that what you remember as well? They were going to follow the chains that Rosen eventually went to?

[49:09] **kushti**: I'm not sure.

[49:13] **qx()**: That's what I thought, because that was his work on MetaMask and integrating into that and that kind of stuff, from what I remember.

[49:19] **kushti**: Minotaur, recently they improved things like MultiSig and privacy-related things, so not done.

[49:30] **qx()**: Multisig on Minotaur is fantastic. I've said it a long time ago, but I'll keep saying it. Like the Sigmanaut transactions, we can bang them out in like, if everybody's paying attention in our channel, we can bang them out in 10, 20 minutes. It's super fast, super nice. Things are saved now so you can go back.

[49:49] **qx()**: There's still room to mess up, of course, but once you get the hang of it, it's very efficient and very nice. So once again, that's a 2.0 version of Minotaur.

[50:00] **kushti**: Right but also the improving things greatly our time so in comparison with early versions. So much easier now, so try it. It's actually, well, a great way to do just simplest DAO, right?

[50:21] **kushti**: So you can just have multisig wallet and some forum or chat and that's all ready. Kind of DAO, right? And I think in many cases, actually, simplicity, well, it's bringing some advantages, right? Like flexibility, for example.

[50:48] **kushti**: So if you just have some telegram chat and RTC quality, then it's super simple and flexible. Then if you need for something more professional, professional looking you may try Paideia right but for starters if you just need to run some DAO with your friends kind of cooperative then just multisig and some chat maybe some forum it's quite good.

[51:33] **qx()**: Well, speaking of that kind of stuff, MGPai was telling me something that he did with his roommates. That was pretty neat. They all mint their own token, right? So they all mint, let's say, 500 tokens. The MGPai token is a Bill token is a John token.

[51:53] **qx()**: And then for utilities and things like that, they send a token to that person that they need to pay and then at the end of the semester when everything's purse are built and every funds come in come out for scholarships and those kind of things they look at their wallets and they're like okay I've got 255 MGPai's in my wallet. You owe me 255 bucks MGPai and that kind of thing.

[52:19] **qx()**: So they settle up after in the cycles essentially. Instead of like piece by piece, they settle up at the end in cycles. So I thought that was a pretty interesting way to use a blockchain and use tokens and wallets. So bravo to MGPai for coming up with that. Pretty cool.

[52:32] **kushti**: Oh yeah, that's interesting actually. Yeah, so this kind of LETS right but exactly. Yeah, but blockchain based and so your local exchange trading system For you're not trusting it's not like your buddies coming to you and saying hey, I built this app that's gonna track our finances. You can use it, but you can't see any of the back end. Just trust me. So the blockchain really puts an end to that. That's a great use of it.

[53:02] **kushti**: Right, but also if you have roommates, then you can put some SigmaUSD, for example, right? And come and treasury and then I have multisig like two out of three multisig for you.

[53:17] **qx()**: I grill on the deck.

[53:18] **kushti**: Yeah, for you or room number 57. That's quite funny.

[53:27] **qx()**: All right, let's see. We got one more question. Here we go. This is from Hermes again. One additional question from him. I'm an embedded software engineer, but I want to get into blockchain development. What's the best place to start learning how to develop on Ergo platform?

[53:47] **kushti**: Oh, yeah. So jump on the main chat, maybe even later today. So I think actually to discuss some possibilities. So if you are embedded platform dev, maybe you know Rust already, right? And then recently,

[54:07] **kushti**: I found some Rust developers in the main chat, which are not contributing yet, so we can discuss doing something like Git circles, ChainCash, and then this merge mine sidechains framework would be done in Rust, right?

[54:29] **kushti**: Yeah, well, a lot of things application-wise and then, but Merge Mined Side Chains even more like core development, maybe a little bit. But then you can go to core developments with Rust, like touching Ergo Rust and so on. We have some tasks there.

[54:58] **kushti**: That there is need to improve some bindings, like Python bindings, for example, and so on. So you can say hi in the main Telegram group, which is bridged with Discord. General channel also. The main Telegram group is called ergo-space-platform.

[55:29] **kushti**: You can find links on the website ergoplatform.org. Then probably on Twitter right and so on so say hi then let's continue the incoming hours then there is also ergo development group but my thought was to use general for a chart what's what's to get feedback on what could be useful for community as well in the first place and what could be a focus for contributors.

[56:14] **kushti**: Then how all those things could be accounted for and rewarded, also another good question. But at some point, we can start to use Git circles to reward, to make accounting at least for contributors. And then for rewarding, well, there are different options like raffles and so on.

[56:46] **kushti**: But if it's about Merchant Mined sidechains, then it's potentially about creating a lot of tokens also. Some of them may be successful. Like Dogecoin. What else? Some Bitcoin sidechains got quite successful also. In past times and nowadays also.

[57:27] **qx()**: So far, so good. It's two minutes past the hour. The sun's coming out. I've got my swimsuit on. I jump in.

[57:35] **kushti**: Yes. So yeah, I see you're looking outside, right? So you are willing to wrap up the may probably, right. And enjoy the summer. So any news in regards with the meetup?

[58:00] **qx()**: No, I think we just retweeted it the other day. We're doing another retweet. But no new news yet, nope.

[58:11] **kushti**: All right, all right. So yeah, so far so good. So let's catch up, guys. Our Telegram and Discord chat.

[58:29] **qx()**: We'll see you guys around chats. See you same time next week.

[58:33] **kushti**: See you guys.
