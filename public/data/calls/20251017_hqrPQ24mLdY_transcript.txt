[00:00] **qx()**: before we know if it starts on there.
[00:02] **qx()**: But welcome, everybody.
[00:04] **qx()**: Welcome to the Ergo Community AMA.
[00:09] **qx()**: It's like the eighth community one we've done, maybe seventh, maybe sixth.
[00:13] **qx()**: Today joining us, we have Grayman and CannonQ.
[00:16] **qx()**: Kushti was here.
[00:17] **qx()**: I think he maybe is experiencing some connectivity issues.
[00:22] **qx()**: Hopefully, we'll see him back after he gets connected.
[00:26] **qx()**: It looks like we are live on YouTube too.
[00:29] **qx()**: So everything's working.
[00:30] **qx()**: Welcome CannonQ.
[00:31] **qx()**: Welcome, Grayman.
[00:32] **qx()**: How was the... Oh, we got Jemai coming too.
[00:35] **qx()**: How was the Ergo Meetup?
[00:37] **qx()**: I guess that's a big question.
[00:38] **qx()**: How to go from your point, guys?

[00:43] **CannonQ**: I'll let you go first, Gray.
[00:45] **qx()**: I don't know if Gray wants to talk, sir.
[00:52] **qx()**: too much traveling, I guess.
[00:55] **qx()**: Or maybe I have to make him, let me, I gotta make him co-host.
[00:59] **qx()**: I got a anti-spam protection.
[01:01] **qx()**: All right, hit it, Grayman.
[01:02] **qx()**: You should be able to unmute now.

[01:05] **Grayman**: It was fantastic.
[01:08] **Grayman**: I got to put a face to some names that I've admired for a long time.
[01:14] **Grayman**: Got to talk to them with, you know, the real-time feedback that you can only get from a in-person conversation.
[01:21] **Grayman**: And overall, it was just a nonstop, intense experience of learning and sort of understanding that I've made the right decision to join this group of people a couple years ago.

[01:42] **Grayman**: Started with Joe giving what amounted to off the cuff remarks.
[01:48] **Grayman**: He threw away his prepared speech.
[01:51] **Grayman**: and gave a banger about sort of the state of the industry and why we're here.
[01:56] **Grayman**: And then speaker after speaker, whether it was technical or not, it just got to more and more backing for the concept that Ergo is a truly different project, that we are true to the essence of Cypherpunk and that we are here to stay.
[02:19] **Grayman**: and that the ideas that are cooking on the front and back burners are going to change the way everything works.

[02:31] **qx()**: I think the funny part there, Grayman, is that you think Joe actually prepared a speech.
[02:38] **qx()**: I think that's Joe for you, right?
[02:40] **qx()**: Always off the cuff, but that's always ends up being the best, that's for sure.
[02:44] **qx()**: Yeah, yeah, it was, it was a lot of fun.
[02:47] **qx()**: You know, I said, you know, I was unable to make it due to a last minute emergency.
[02:51] **qx()**: But so I ran the show from the digital side of the show from New York.
[02:57] **qx()**: But, you know, sitting there all day, waiting for

[03:01] **qx()**: I think I made the mistake of telling Joe that the schedule is there, but it's not super important to not feel rushed or anything, and that was probably the biggest mistake of my life.
[03:13] **qx()**: There were times when I'm like, Joe, you ready?
[03:16] **qx()**: You ready to go?
[03:16] **qx()**: And Joe's like, yeah, they're all outside for a smoke break.
[03:20] **qx()**: We're outside.
[03:21] **qx()**: It's probably going to be 30 minutes.
[03:23] **qx()**: Then at lunchtime, you guys decided instead to bring your lunch back to enjoy yourselves out of the restaurant, which was fantastic.
[03:31] **qx()**: That was really funny, but we played it and it worked really well.

[03:37] **qx()**: But as I was saying, it was really amazing to sit there and not be bored out of my gourd.
[03:44] **qx()**: These typical things that I go to, blockchain conferences or anything like that,
[03:49] **qx()**: You're sitting there and typically the speaker gets in the way of what they're trying to convey, even if they have something somewhat interesting to say, right?
[03:58] **qx()**: They get in the way either with ego or with just trying to push something that doesn't make sense or whatnot.
[04:04] **qx()**: or some corporate bullshit that I just can't sit through.
[04:08] **qx()**: But listening to these guys talk, all the speakers that we had, MGPi, Ann and BR, Ken and yourself, Joe, Cheese, it was absolutely fantastic.
[04:19] **qx()**: Luca, everything that I listened to, I was engaged in and able to understand.
[04:26] **qx()**: I didn't even have to try to ask questions or come up with any because you guys really nailed it from your end, keeping those guys engaged.
[04:32] **qx()**: So that was amazing.
[04:33] **qx()**: I just want to say you guys did a fantastic job presenting.
[04:37] **qx()**: It looked like you had a ton of fun.
[04:39] **qx()**: I hope you guys stayed out of the wacky tobacco too much down there, did you?

[04:43] **Grayman**: We didn't have the mic pointed towards the audience.
[04:47] **Grayman**: I'm not sure that all the questions came through, but I think the speakers did a pretty good job of handling that.
[04:54] **Grayman**: And yeah, it was amazing.
[04:56] **Grayman**: It was anything but boring, especially considering that a couple of these projects are really just on the threshold of coming to fruition, like Lithos.
[05:08] **Grayman**: I mean, this fall is going to be very interesting for ERG, regardless of what the market does.

[05:16] **qx()**: Yeah.
[05:17] **qx()**: Yeah, I agree.
[05:18] **qx()**: I agree.
[05:19] **qx()**: It was great to hear what's it called?
[05:23] **qx()**: what's it called?
[05:23] **qx()**: Lithos.
[05:24] **qx()**: That deep dive of Lithos was, I don't know, that was great to listen to.
[05:29] **qx()**: Just listening to what the possibilities are and then the kicker at the end where this is not even Ergo agnostic.
[05:36] **qx()**: This can be applied to any mining chain as well.
[05:39] **qx()**: So it's amazing that we have people in the community and people in the
[05:44] **qx()**: and the dev sphere here that build because it's a great idea and then it can help benefit more than just our wallets or the people right in front of our faces kind of thing.
[05:54] **qx()**: So I thought that was really awesome to hear that from Cheese.
[05:59] **qx()**: What was the highlight?
[06:00] **qx()**: What was your highlight, Grayman?

[06:08] **Grayman**: The night before for drinks.
[06:10] **Grayman**: and get our picture taken in front of that shiny neon sign that said, girls just want to have fun.
[06:15] **Grayman**: We were supposed to send that off to the Cardano girls and see what they thought.
[06:19] **Grayman**: But yeah.
[06:20] **qx()**: Sir, you sure that wasn't a male strip club?

[06:25] **Grayman**: It's hard to pick a highlight because it was, like I said, it was a very intense experience.
[06:31] **Grayman**: I mean, it was nice to wind down afterwards with that dinner.
[06:36] **Grayman**: Yeah.
[06:37] **qx()**: Tell us about the dinner.
[06:38] **qx()**: What happened?
[06:39] **Grayman**: Yeah.
[06:41] **Grayman**: FAKU plus Chris Ray did his, did a tour of duty.
[06:47] **Grayman**: I think Benzo helped them to collect all the stuff and get things prepped.
[06:53] **Grayman**: I was on KP because I was a professional dishwasher earlier in my life.
[06:58] **Grayman**: So.
[07:00] **Grayman**: It was delicious.
[07:01] **Grayman**: It was everybody.
[07:02] **Grayman**: It was cook at the table basically and so that encourages a certain amount of moving around and talking to each other and sort of winding down after all the talks.

[07:12] **Grayman**: The one regret that I have from us being sort of disorganized about the timing of things, I'm sure that was frustrating for you, but we were sitting there thinking, you know, anybody that didn't make it to this thing, they can suffer.
[07:25] **Grayman**: You know, they're going to get to watch this on YouTube anyway.
[07:29] **Grayman**: But my regret was that we didn't go to the Garden of the Gods on a walk afterwards, because by the time it was all finished, it was time to get ready for dinner.
[07:37] **Grayman**: And I guess a couple of people drove there.
[07:40] **Grayman**: but I think they missed the sunset.
[07:42] **Grayman**: It was wonderful.

[07:44] **qx()**: Awesome.
[07:45] **qx()**: Awesome.
[07:45] **qx()**: How about you, CannonQ?
[07:47] **qx()**: Cannon, what was your experience?

[07:51] **CannonQ**: I didn't really know what to expect.
[08:01] **CannonQ**: The most interesting part to me was I've watched
[08:09] **CannonQ**: in recent and past history, like Luca, Shashir, Cheese, Karat, even Allison, like give presentations.
[08:22] **CannonQ**: And I think everyone is more comfortable with that now, which, I mean, the first three I mentioned are all pretty young cats for those who haven't watched the videos.
[08:35] **CannonQ**: But all of their projects
[08:39] **CannonQ**: or either like in a beta like live or about to be there.
[08:47] **CannonQ**: And so the thing that every one of them said was, I even understand it better.
[08:56] **CannonQ**: Like a year ago when I was talking about Lithos, I didn't really have it all figured out yet.
[09:04] **CannonQ**: You know, and so there's an amount of courage that goes into even presenting a concept that you don't have all the details fully fleshed out or how you're going to get there.
[09:18] **CannonQ**: But then seeing those guys, that was very impressive.

[09:27] **CannonQ**: There's a lot of different
[09:30] **CannonQ**: protocols, I guess, if you want to call it that, that are coming online in the next probably, let's say, six months, maybe nine months, because there's probably going to be snags at the end that weren't foreseen.
[09:46] **CannonQ**: But there's three or four that aren't, they're not done anywhere else, you know, in quote unquote, crypto.
[09:54] **CannonQ**: Like, it's going to be interesting to see
[09:58] **CannonQ**: how that goes.
[10:00] **CannonQ**: It just continues to be, you know, head down and build.
[10:05] **CannonQ**: It's just encouraging to see.
[10:08] **CannonQ**: So anyway, it was that was probably what blew me away the most.

[10:18] **CannonQ**: There were too many things that I enjoyed to say, like one favorite, one of the
[10:24] **CannonQ**: One of the things I enjoyed was Joe, myself, Shashir, Luca, and Karat went to Garden of the Gods.
[10:34] **CannonQ**: And of course we were 20 minutes late.
[10:36] **CannonQ**: You know, we were, I think HQ said it best.
[10:40] **CannonQ**: We were one long block away from being there before sunset.
[10:44] **CannonQ**: We missed it.
[10:46] **CannonQ**: But.
[10:48] **CannonQ**: It was that was fun, you know, the getting those guys out in nature and to Grayman's point, I wish everyone had been able to go, but it was just, I mean, it was late, trying to get everyone, you know, moving around and stuff, but it definitely has a different vibe than trying to do everything just online.
[11:11] **CannonQ**: And it was crazy.
[11:12] **CannonQ**: I mean, there was three countries there, three different countries, even though we're out in South Colorado.
[11:17] **CannonQ**: So.
[11:19] **CannonQ**: Yeah, good trip.

[11:22] **qx()**: And your talk was great, too, CannonQ.
[11:24] **qx()**: That was fantastic to hear that that kind of thing kind of exists already in the fiat world without blockchain and that there's an option or an entry point where you could possibly put that over top of it and offer that.

[11:42] **CannonQ**: Yeah, the funny feedback
[11:49] **CannonQ**: Joe's sister was there and she had had poor experiences with barter like back in the day like 10, 20 years ago to the point where she wouldn't accept it if a client asked if they would accept barter credit she just turned the client down initially like right there.
[12:13] **CannonQ**: And she was like, you know, what you're describing is not my experience.
[12:17] **CannonQ**: And I said, well, this group in my local region, I mean, they're really hustling.
[12:22] **CannonQ**: I mean, like it's shaking hands, kissing babies, making sure that things happen.
[12:28] **CannonQ**: They're involved in almost every transaction that's over, you know, call it four or $5,000 just to make sure everything goes well.
[12:35] **CannonQ**: You know, so there's a lot of local handholding on this kind of thing to make it work well.

[12:41] **qx()**: So where a DAO could jump in that manner, right?
[12:43] **qx()**: An oversight DAO kind of thing.
[12:46] **CannonQ**: I think you're going to have to have even like more handholding than that.
[12:52] **CannonQ**: But I don't know yet.
[12:53] **CannonQ**: You know, like I'm open to anything.

[12:55] **Grayman**: Leave room for somebody to do some work and make some money.
[13:01] **Grayman**: And yeah.
[13:02] **Grayman**: And these guys are already making money.
[13:04] **Grayman**: you know, in a conventional database that they host system and the value add that was presented is pretty intuitive to all of us, but maybe not to people that are already in that industry.
[13:22] **Grayman**: And yet, by being in a barter or in the position of trying to convince people to barter their services and goods, they're already sort of stretching what is the normal
[13:33] **Grayman**: way of doing business in America, and so they might be receptive to that.
[13:37] **Grayman**: I think it's a fantastic idea.
[13:40] **Grayman**: It's more of a sales job than a technical job, although I know, and so I was pretty excited to see how much effort you put into that presentation and presumably talking to these guys down in Arkansas and Louisiana.

[13:57] **CannonQ**: Yeah, yeah, well, and let me get, so here's the highlight.
[14:02] **CannonQ**: Joe's sister says that she's really polite about it you know and she just flew back home and she just sent a message to Joe this was late last night he sends it to me so before this is her quote so before Saturday I hadn't heard the word barter in more than a decade tonight I was introduced to a guy
[14:25] **CannonQ**: And he is leading the charge of one of the largest global barter entities.
[14:30] **CannonQ**: I mentioned very top-line what you guys were talking about.
[14:34] **CannonQ**: And he is interested in learning more.
[14:36] **CannonQ**: What a crazy coincidence.

[14:38] **qx()**: Wow.
[14:39] **qx()**: The fates have aligned.
[14:40] **qx()**: What are you manifesting there, Cannon?
[14:44] **CannonQ**: Yeah, I don't know, man.
[14:46] **CannonQ**: But it's just...
[14:49] **CannonQ**: I mean, it's sort of it's a joke, but it's like good vibes, right?
[14:53] **CannonQ**: Like when I used to be on Twitter, I'd post surf videos.
[14:56] **CannonQ**: I mean, those are like the happiest athletes.
[14:58] **CannonQ**: I know they're bearing down, but, you know, them and skateboarders got to be the happiest athletes.
[15:04] **CannonQ**: It's just good vibes, right?
[15:05] **CannonQ**: Because they're doing something you shouldn't be able to do.
[15:07] **CannonQ**: And I think that's sort of where we need to be.
[15:10] **CannonQ**: And it's
[15:12] **CannonQ**: Yeah, I'm excited.
[15:13] **Byron**: I mean, it's it has to be basketball players for sure.
[15:17] **CannonQ**: For sure.
[15:20] **Byron**: Think about it.
[15:21] **Byron**: Think about it.
[15:21] **CannonQ**: That's a job, man.
[15:22] **CannonQ**: That's a job.
[15:23] **CannonQ**: My business partner.
[15:25] **CannonQ**: That's true.
[15:27] **CannonQ**: I met professional tennis players, all those things.
[15:29] **CannonQ**: It's a job.
[15:30] **CannonQ**: It's a business.
[15:33] **CannonQ**: Surfing is a good point.
[15:34] **CannonQ**: It's still sort of ancillary, right?
[15:37] **CannonQ**: Like those guys are making money, but they're not getting
[15:41] **CannonQ**: You know, twenty fifty million dollar contracts and having to change their whole life for it.
[15:45] **CannonQ**: But anyway, yeah, that was sort of the full circle on even my little discussion as a non-dev just for a crazy idea.

[15:59] **CannonQ**: So, yeah, I just want to I mean, publicly, I said it there before the recording, but thank you to Joe for
[16:06] **CannonQ**: You know, just saying now that sounds cool as he and I were talking about it for the last couple months.
[16:11] **CannonQ**: He's like, yeah, why don't you present?
[16:12] **CannonQ**: I'm like, yeah, I don't know.
[16:15] **CannonQ**: And then I think he publicly said, oh yeah, Cannon's going to present on this.
[16:19] **CannonQ**: So I couldn't really back out at that point.
[16:22] **CannonQ**: So anyway, I appreciate it and appreciate the opportunity.

[16:27] **qx()**: Yeah, that was great.
[16:30] **qx()**: Yeah, FAKU is there as well, right, representative?
[16:34] **qx()**: I was hoping maybe next time we can get FAKU to talk about local trades and those kind of things with Honey and how those kind of things work.
[16:45] **qx()**: And you can bring those into the blockchain.
[16:46] **qx()**: But maybe we can get him to talk about it next year at the next meetup.
[16:52] **qx()**: How's that sound, Jermai?
[16:55] **qx()**: Yeah, any thumbs up?
[16:57] **qx()**: Oh, did I make Jemai?
[16:58] **qx()**: Let me see if I blocked Jemai from talking.
[17:01] **qx()**: No, he commented.
[17:02] **qx()**: He commented.
[17:03] **qx()**: Okay.
[17:03] **qx()**: He said skater die next time.
[17:04] **qx()**: Perfect.
[17:05] **qx()**: Great.
[17:05] **qx()**: That sounds good.

[17:07] **qx()**: Yeah, I think, I think this is a great start.
[17:09] **qx()**: I think Kushti mentioned that he wanted to have it in what's a Barbados?
[17:15] **qx()**: No, some, what was the place Kushti wanted it next year in Mexico?

[17:21] **Kushti**: Acapulco.
[17:22] **Kushti**: So it's the late February AnarkoPulco conference.
[17:27] **Kushti**: So.
[17:28] **Kushti**: Let me check how big is that.
[17:33] **Kushti**: We may ask a route, so they visited it a few years ago.

[17:39] **qx()**: What conference is it at that time?
[17:41] **Kushti**: AnarkoPulco.
[17:44] **qx()**: It's a blockchain conference there?
[17:45] **qx()**: Or you mean just have the meetup there?

[17:48] **Kushti**: So it's...
[17:51] **Kushti**: So a lot of cryptocurrency folks there, but yeah, it's basically anarchy related.
[18:00] **Kushti**: So not necessarily cryptocurrencies, but yeah, a lot of cryptocurrency folks, including organizers, which are super OGs, Bitcoin OGs, yeah.

[18:16] **qx()**: Oh, awesome.
[18:17] **qx()**: Okay.
[18:18] **qx()**: All right.
[18:18] **qx()**: We'll get that figured out, Kushti, and then we'll start trying to plan it and see how it looks.

[18:26] **Kushti**: Yeah.
[18:27] **Kushti**: Let's see.
[18:28] **Kushti**: So let's have a chat with Lutz or the telegram.

[18:33] **qx()**: Great.
[18:34] **qx()**: So that's where Lutz is from?

[18:39] **Kushti**: Lutz is from New York.
[18:42] **Kushti**: Yeah, so before, so now he's doing some marketing for Komodo and before he did some efforts for Pirate Chain and yeah, they had a booth back in 2020 or 21, something like that.
[19:00] **Kushti**: So they invited us Ergo community back then, but yeah, we didn't have folks back then around.
[19:11] **Kushti**: to join.
[19:12] **Kushti**: So yeah, not possible.
[19:14] **Kushti**: So let's check what's pirates and other communities.

[19:19] **qx()**: Yeah.
[19:20] **qx()**: Not bad weather there too.
[19:24] **qx()**: Right.
[19:24] **qx()**: Cannon, you looked it up.
[19:25] **qx()**: It was like 80 degrees in February or something like that.

[19:31] **CannonQ**: Yeah, I think so.
[19:32] **qx()**: OK, I think we can handle that, right?
[19:34] **qx()**: That's swimming weather.
[19:35] **qx()**: Maybe not in the Pacific, but definitely for somebody in New York in the winter.
[19:42] **qx()**: Definitely feels warm.

[19:45] **CannonQ**: Yeah, the Pacific's always cold.
[19:46] **qx()**: Yeah.
[19:48] **qx()**: For sure.

[19:50] **qx()**: What else?
[19:51] **qx()**: Ben, you were there.
[19:52] **qx()**: You were at the meetup, right?
[19:57] **qx()**: No, I was in New York.
[19:59] **qx()**: Different Ben.
[20:00] **qx()**: You're not Benzo.
[20:01] **qx()**: Yeah, all right.
[20:02] **qx()**: Too many Benz.
[20:03] **qx()**: I get them confused.

[20:04] **Byron**: Oh, yeah, my bad.
[20:05] **Byron**: Wrong profile.
[20:06] **Byron**: But yeah.
[20:07] **qx()**: Oh, there you go.
[20:09] **Byron**: Yeah, I was there.
[20:10] **Byron**: I had a situation where I left my physical card.
[20:14] **Byron**: So the perfect use case was there.
[20:18] **Byron**: What did you do?
[20:20] **Byron**: I left my physical card and I needed cash to make a purchase for some commodities.
[20:24] **Byron**: Okay.
[20:25] **Byron**: And I couldn't get these commodities in Colorado that I needed without my physical card.
[20:30] **Byron**: You know, tap is everywhere.
[20:32] **Byron**: You can have your debit card, credit card, you know, whatever card, gift card on there.
[20:38] **Byron**: So I'm thinking you can pay with that.
[20:39] **Byron**: They're like, oh, we don't accept this.
[20:43] **Byron**: Don't comment that on my commodities.

[20:45] **qx()**: Oh, I think I think I know what you mean, because some some facilities don't allow credit processing because it's a federal crime still.
[20:52] **qx()**: So they like cash.
[20:54] **qx()**: I'm not going to mention what that facility is.
[20:58] **qx()**: So what'd you do?
[21:00] **qx()**: You found some nice guy who does like local barter trading with honey and you gave him some herbs?

[21:07] **Byron**: Yeah, yeah.
[21:08] **Byron**: I wonder who that could be.
[21:10] **Byron**: He's like 6'10".
[21:13] **Byron**: You know what I mean?
[21:14] **qx()**: Works for the CIA.
[21:16] **Byron**: No, I'm joking.
[21:17] **Byron**: No, I'm joking.
[21:17] **Byron**: He had his cool chill shades on, transition lenses.
[21:24] **Byron**: That's my guy.

[21:26] **qx()**: So tell me the story.
[21:28] **qx()**: You sent him some ERG?
[21:29] **Byron**: Yep.
[21:30] **Byron**: Yep.
[21:30] **Byron**: We made the transfer.
[21:32] **Byron**: I got cash in person and then we made a quick transfer.
[21:37] **Byron**: So we got to do it in front of Anon, which is nice.
[21:43] **Byron**: So if he's going in February, I'm going.

[21:46] **qx()**: That is awesome.
[21:47] **qx()**: Did your swapper make you wait 10 blocks for confirmation, just like the central exchanges do before they said it was OK and you could have the cash?

[22:00] **Byron**: Oh, no, no, no.
[22:01] **Byron**: They fronted me the cash because we're all at the... That is Kushti.
[22:05] **Byron**: Yeah, it was just off the strength.
[22:07] **Byron**: It was just off the strength, you know.
[22:08] **qx()**: Pre-block time.
[22:12] **Byron**: You can see those tweets back in 21.
[22:15] **Byron**: Proof of history, right?

[22:16] **qx()**: Oh, that's awesome.
[22:20] **Grayman**: I paid for my share of dinner with four silver quarters.
[22:25] **qx()**: Oh, nice.
[22:25] **qx()**: Did you bring some dime bags as in silver dimes, Grayman, with you?

[22:29] **Grayman**: I brought a bunch of silver dime bags and I've got some of those left over that I'm not going to touch until I meet some other people in person.
[22:39] **Grayman**: And I also brought a handful of silver quarters and gave one of those to everybody that spoke along with their dime bag and paid for my dinner with silver quarters.
[22:51] **Grayman**: In fact, I overpaid a little.
[22:53] **Grayman**: I gave them five of them.
[22:54] **Grayman**: But then Chris needed a couch to crash on, so he gave me one back.

[23:28] **Byron**: It was a I can't I can't pick just one because Joe started off because I love the rants.
[23:34] **Byron**: So whenever we get those type of rants, I'm all that's my type of time.
[23:39] **Byron**: But then I like the like by the book accounting that Kenny was doing.
[23:45] **Byron**: But I really liked the Lithos.
[23:48] **Byron**: But the explanation that M.G.
[23:53] **Byron**: gave was amazing.
[23:55] **Byron**: When he gave his explanation about how the differences between the styles of contracts and how they're executed and all that type of stuff in the trees, I was like, oh man, that's dope.
[24:05] **Byron**: So everybody gave a great presentation.
[24:07] **Byron**: Oh, and then Anon's at the end with the bytes.
[24:10] **Byron**: And then how many, 290 transactions?
[24:12] **Byron**: I was like, oh good God, that's not even with sub-blocks.

[24:15] **qx()**: 3,601 for a minimum, and then 16,000, I think, was the maximum with this.
[24:20] **qx()**: So mind blowing, right?
[24:22] **qx()**: It's absolutely crazy.

[24:23] **Grayman**: You're talking about Machina Finance, and that was absolutely mind blowing for me.
[24:28] **Grayman**: I hadn't really considered it before because I'm not really interested in any of these parts of crypto that resemble stock trading.
[24:35] **Grayman**: I don't give a shit.
[24:36] **Grayman**: I'm here for the local exchange stuff.
[24:40] **Grayman**: But listening to that was fascinating because I know that one thing that people are constantly wringing their hands about is liquidity.
[24:48] **Grayman**: And that's a system that could potentially bring an enormous amount of liquidity on chain passively without investors having to actively make trades.
[24:57] **Grayman**: They just set its Machina Finance.
[25:00] **Grayman**: So basically within your wallet, without going through central exchanges,
[25:05] **Grayman**: There's a bot that you spent a part of your of your assets.
[25:10] **Grayman**: You assign them to this bot and you tell it I want you to trade within a grid against other traders who are also doing this and maximize my ERG stack or maximize my SigmaUSD stack or whatever it is you want to try and trade towards and assign it that task or maybe even just assign it the task of just collecting at a certain price or something simple.
[25:35] **Grayman**: But you'll be able to do that.
[25:37] **Grayman**: You'll be able to set it and forget it, and it will trade against other people who are doing the same thing without any ERG ever having to leave or these other assets ever having to leave the ecosystem.
[25:48] **Grayman**: So now when people want to make a trade, they don't have to worry about is there enough liquidity at this particular trading pair or what have you.
[25:57] **Grayman**: The first thing that they're going to do is their machine is just going to try and execute that trade for them.
[26:03] **Grayman**: Now you can be patient because instead of worrying that, oh shit, you know, I put my assets on trade over and I'm waiting for this trade to go through and I'm just going to give it some time.
[26:16] **Grayman**: But all of a sudden the Canadian government decides that they're going to raid their offices.
[26:19] **Grayman**: And suddenly the money that you had waiting for your trade is gone and you can't pull it back to your wallet.
[26:25] **Grayman**: This is non-custodial trading.
[26:27] **Grayman**: And I don't think that any of these DEXes are ready for what's coming their way.
[26:32] **Grayman**: Once we get that shit online, it's going to start slow because nobody knows.
[26:36] **Grayman**: But once people figure out that that's possible, why would you go to a DEX?

[26:43] **qx()**: Yeah.
[26:43] **qx()**: I mean, anybody that knows anything, why would you go to a DEX, right?
[26:45] **qx()**: Yeah.
[26:47] **Byron**: And then over time is always going to be the tightest spreads.
[26:50] **Byron**: They can quote.
[26:51] **Byron**: That's always going to be the argument.

[26:56] **CannonQ**: Yeah, that question is getting more people involved.
[26:59] **CannonQ**: And yeah, the main thing that centralized exchanges have is they have the ramps right now and they control the ramps.
[27:06] **CannonQ**: So Alex has mentioned a couple of times like something like BISC or something, you know, finding ways to go back in time sort of.
[27:17] **CannonQ**: I think that'll be key for sure.

[27:24] **CannonQ**: But I want to give a big, he gets it all the time, but Alex Kushti, with you and the guys that develop Ergo platform, I think everyone there came away with a bigger appreciation for how much foresight you guys had and adding
[27:50] **CannonQ**: AVL trees and NIPoPoWs and just all these different, you know, the ability to add sub-blocks after the fact.
[28:01] **CannonQ**: Yeah, I mean, just the way that the protocol and the platform was designed is we're all still scratching the surface, but
[28:12] **CannonQ**: All three of those young gigabrains, all of them said, yeah, I think it was two or three years in.
[28:20] **CannonQ**: And I was trying to figure something out.
[28:24] **CannonQ**: And Kushti was like, why don't you use AVL trees?
[28:26] **CannonQ**: And Karat was like, what the hell is an AVL tree?
[28:29] **CannonQ**: And he goes, now I use them all the time.
[28:31] **CannonQ**: Luca uses it all the time for Pidea.
[28:33] **CannonQ**: Everyone's using them, but they didn't even know what they were.
[28:41] **CannonQ**: And his comparison was they have the Merkle trees and trees on Cardano.
[28:50] **CannonQ**: But it's almost like it's an L2.
[28:52] **CannonQ**: It's a bolt on.
[28:53] **CannonQ**: So there's still an air gap between you and that tree where on Ergo, it's in the base layer.
[29:02] **CannonQ**: It's just anyway.
[29:04] **CannonQ**: I mean, all of us were just in awe of
[29:08] **CannonQ**: the research and the foresight that went into this protocol.
[29:11] **CannonQ**: So thank you.

[29:12] **qx()**: It's almost like Kushti could see into the future, or at least learn from his mistakes and pulled into that.
[29:18] **qx()**: I think one thing that people should have hopefully picked up from MG Pai's talk
[29:25] **qx()**: At least you have a guy that works for Palm, which is a multi-chain company, right?
[29:30] **qx()**: They're on Ergo, they're on Cardano, they're on Binance.
[29:33] **qx()**: All right, so this guy's worked with Ethereum contracts, this guy's worked with Cardano contracts, this guy's worked with Ergo contracts.
[29:40] **qx()**: And here he is telling the community, while he mentions, you know, Merkle Trees, also
[29:47] **qx()**: mentions that, you know, Ergo's tech in that matter is better, right?
[29:50] **qx()**: Or more well thought out.
[29:52] **qx()**: And as Cannon said, bolted right in and not bolted on top.
[29:56] **qx()**: So absolutely amazing to hear that from a dev that's multi-platformed that can come back and say, yeah, Ergo is kind of where it's at with this kind of thing.
[30:05] **qx()**: Byron, just interrupt us.
[30:07] **qx()**: No hands, man.

[30:09] **Byron**: Oh, no.
[30:09] **Byron**: I'm going to go out to Kushti.
[30:10] **Byron**: He was going to speak.
[30:11] **qx()**: Oh, Kushti.
[30:11] **qx()**: What were you going to say?

[30:15] **Kushti**: Yeah, actually, some notes I would like to give.
[30:22] **Kushti**: But the most important probably is about local trade, right?
[30:26] **Kushti**: So this is the thing we need to empower.
[30:30] **Kushti**: So yeah, did a lot of
[30:33] **Kushti**: updates to basis contract and tracker recently.
[30:39] **Kushti**: And now, Grayman, I'm going to put silver sense document in the Chain Cash repo, if you agreed on that.
[30:48] **Kushti**: And then, yeah, I think to add details and yeah, try to get it technically sound right and then implementable.
[31:00] **Kushti**: What do you think about that?

[31:01] **Grayman**: You can do whatever you want.
[31:04] **Grayman**: That three paragraph thing that I put up there was just a summary of a bunch of other stuff that I've written.
[31:11] **Grayman**: I've been trying to assemble something a little bit more presentable in general, both from like the 30,000 foot perspective, but also one from the vendors perspective.
[31:24] **Grayman**: I like to think of things in sort of game theory like who wants this and why and how are they going to use it?
[31:31] **Grayman**: So I have more writing
[31:33] **Grayman**: Already done, but it's not organized enough to commit to any sort of public documentation.
[31:38] **Grayman**: But if you want to grab that and run with it, go for it.
[31:40] **Grayman**: I mean, there's nothing that I said in there that I think is wrong.
[31:44] **Grayman**: I just think it's incomplete.
[31:46] **Grayman**: And also, you know.
[31:49] **Grayman**: Silver sense depends on some stuff that that just doesn't exist yet, including the work that you're talking about doing, but also just fundamentally.
[31:58] **Grayman**: I mean, it needs Dexy Silver or some other
[32:02] **Grayman**: Silver stable coin that is independent of the mechanism proposed in silver sense and which is redemption by actual physical silver by the issuing by the one that issues the note.
[32:17] **Grayman**: But at the same time, I mean, forward motion is forward motion.
[32:22] **Grayman**: So go for it.
[32:23] **Grayman**: Don't let me stop you.

[32:26] **Kushti**: All right, so let's try to understand why it is incomplete, right?
[32:32] **Kushti**: So yeah, I need to get through details, right?
[32:39] **Kushti**: And yeah, about Dexy Silver also in the Gold Oracle Group, we had discussions just yesterday or today.
[32:51] **Kushti**: depending on a time zone, merging silver oracle code into the oracle pool implementation and then it's possible to run the silver oracle pool and then it's just a question of
[33:13] **Kushti**: liquidity bootstrapping rights to launch Dexy Silver or Gleon Silver.
[33:19] **Kushti**: Then, yeah, I also recorded recently an implementation of that scheme I've proposed at some point on Ergo forum about making insurance with digital commodity for a physical
[33:43] **Kushti**: one, right?
[33:44] **Kushti**: So it was about gold, like doing insurance with digital gold for a risk of physical gold non-delivery.
[33:55] **Kushti**: So maybe it would be useful as well, right?
[33:58] **Kushti**: In the context of SilverSense.

[34:01] **Grayman**: Yes, it will.
[34:04] **Grayman**: I was thinking about that paper because it was speaking specifically about volts and how they would use it.
[34:13] **Grayman**: And the entire point of SilverSense is to give a special status, but also some responsibilities to vendors as opposed to customers.
[34:22] **Grayman**: So they all use it, but the vendors are the ones that sort of act as the distributed banking system.
[34:28] **Grayman**: And so they would need, they would use this essentially as a way to make it convenient for trade between each other and with their customers.
[34:39] **Grayman**: And also as a sort of a form of insurance.
[34:42] **Grayman**: And so, you know, when they're trading with other vendors.
[34:47] **Grayman**: So I think, yeah, that that definitely relates.
[34:50] **Grayman**: And then there's also the reputation system issues that would have to go into it.
[34:55] **Grayman**: So when I was handing out these dime bags, I was I was basically saying it was essentially just a little bag.
[35:02] **Grayman**: And, you know, for any foreign viewers that don't know a dime bag is in the old days, it was how you bought pot if you were just buying a little
[35:09] **Grayman**: And so, but these were, there was no marijuana in this.
[35:14] **Grayman**: It was just a silver dime and a paper wallet that I printed using the MewMart Paper Wallet tool.
[35:21] **Grayman**: And those paper wallets contained about as much in tokens as the value of a silver dime at the time that I minted them.
[35:30] **Grayman**: And so now the race is, which is going to be worth more per year.
[35:34] **Grayman**: And silver's off to a good start, but we'll see.
[35:37] **Grayman**: I'm betting on ERG personally.

[35:40] **Grayman**: In any case, I told people, first of all, don't put anything valuable on that paper wallet, because I got the keys to all that shit.
[35:49] **Grayman**: And don't tempt me.
[35:51] **Grayman**: And secondly, SilverSense itself is a ways away from implementation.
[35:57] **Grayman**: It's an idea right now.
[35:59] **Grayman**: But eventually, it's something that makes sense just because we have this asset here in America that I don't think is very common of just this very large
[36:09] **Grayman**: and already distributed current tokenized currency that's uncensorable.
[36:16] **Grayman**: So it's kind of a cool asset to take advantage of, but it'll take some time.
[36:20] **Grayman**: We got to wind it up.
[36:22] **Grayman**: Doesn't happen without forward motion.
[36:24] **Grayman**: So like I said, do whatever you want in terms to push it forward and I will keep growing as I can.

[36:30] **qx()**: That's awesome.
[36:32] **qx()**: Byron.
[36:34] **Byron**: You can let T-Maz jump in there.
[36:37] **Byron**: I think he was, or Kushti.
[36:39] **Byron**: I'll go after everybody.

[36:42] **qx()**: Whoever wants to chat, just jump in, guys.
[36:44] **Kushti**: Go for it.
[36:44] **Kushti**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:45] **Kushti**: So, Grayman, so, yeah, let's put some more meat there, right?
[36:51] **Kushti**: So, yeah, a lot of code get done recently.
[36:56] **Kushti**: So, yeah, now we just need to connect the dots, right, and understand, well, the missing parts and the...
[37:03] **Kushti**: Yeah, so Thomas authorized Kent.

[37:09] **TMas**: On the note of the silver sense, I've actually been trying to develop like a prospectus to send into local credit unions and like gold or coin shops.
[37:20] **TMas**: So my idea behind it is kind of like what Grayman was thinking, you know, like a local distribution hub of sorts almost.
[37:29] **TMas**: So
[37:30] **TMas**: The only thing is with it is that it's a little bit confusing, like how you guys were speaking about the bartering earlier.
[37:36] **TMas**: You know, a lot of people are kind of like apprehensive, like, oh, this is on the blockchain.
[37:41] **TMas**: And then they get like a little bit like kind of sketched out.
[37:45] **TMas**: But I think overall, like given enough time, there's really no way we'll be able to get any large, like a tier bank to support any of those kinds of transactions just simply because
[37:58] **TMas**: they just don't want to unless they have a contract with somebody that's like an insider thing like the DEXes basically there's really no possible way that that could ever be achieved so the next best bet I figured is like local credit unions like for example
[38:15] **TMas**: This is different than like gold or silver, but this is like even an expansion upon the idea.
[38:20] **TMas**: Say you have like a thousand dollars of like silver or you buy like some beater piece of shit car that you take into your credit union and you give them the title and then they'll give you a loan based on that amount.
[38:34] **TMas**: But that can basically be like kind of like a interactive way to like kind of ATM.
[38:42] **TMas**: transact via Ergo so like if you go to your local credit union or your coin shop and on on top of that like with the coin shops they could even be like custodial holders for the chain so they could get like incentivized like if you pay for an ETF like I think it's 0.05 percent for like holding fees and stuff because
[39:02] **TMas**: From what I have talked to the shops about, that's their main concern for the ones that there's actually a fair amount of people that are interested.
[39:10] **TMas**: They would just like a prospectus for it.
[39:13] **TMas**: So the main problem with them though, was they were saying the amount of insurance extra costs for the amount of inventory added, there would need to be a way to cover their insurance costs, obviously.
[39:27] **TMas**: So that way they don't just have a whole ton of gold sitting there for Ergo.
[39:31] **TMas**: That's not insured.
[39:33] **TMas**: But that's kind of like the route that I was thinking about going down with like how to implement Chain Cash and things like that into actual function.

[39:44] **Grayman**: So that's a little more centralized than I'm thinking.
[39:47] **Grayman**: But I acknowledge that some degree of centralization is necessary.
[39:51] **Grayman**: So I'm a little less centralized because I'm thinking this is not going to be handled by credit unions or coin shops.
[39:58] **Grayman**: It's going to be handled by the vendors that want to transact in this stuff.
[40:01] **Grayman**: And the most valuable thing that's on the network is not going to be the silver dimes and quarters or the silver cents tokens on Ergo.
[40:11] **Grayman**: It's going to be the goods and services that they're trading for those things by definition, because that's why people want to engage in that trade.
[40:20] **Grayman**: So it distribute also by making it silver cents instead of gold or like larger, more numismatic silver or other precious metals.
[40:30] **Grayman**: By just making it this simple crappy junk silver, right?
[40:35] **Grayman**: It makes it so that you can't really accumulate enough of this to become a target for, you know, organized crime or the IRS.
[40:44] **Grayman**: But I repeat myself, you know, it's it's more of a like a local commerce, small amounts of money.
[40:53] **Grayman**: But if it caught on, those small amounts of money have access
[40:57] **Grayman**: to about $15 billion worth of these tokens that are already spread all around this country.
[41:04] **Grayman**: So no bank, no credit union needed.
[41:07] **Grayman**: The vendors are the banks, the ones who are selling their services, which is the valuable part of the whole system.
[41:15] **Grayman**: That's what makes an economy.
[41:16] **Grayman**: It's not money.
[41:18] **Grayman**: It's the goods and services that are on exchange.
[41:21] **Grayman**: Money is just the token that moves it around.
[41:23] **Grayman**: Banks and coin shops love to gather that stuff in and think about how they can profit and make an economy off of money.
[41:31] **Grayman**: But the real economy is people cutting hair, moving furniture, building things.
[41:37] **Grayman**: That's the economy.
[41:38] **Grayman**: So if you design it in such a way that the people that are doing those things can be the ones who are maintaining their small portion of the bank, leaning on the blockchain for the creation of this credit.
[41:52] **Grayman**: And for also accounting for, you know, the distribution of these of these tokens and then they just have to keep enough on hand that they can redeem for like if another vendor gets enough of these of their silver cents in their hand, they come back and say, look, I love you and I love your haircuts, but I've got like $10 and silver cents here and that would get me haircuts for the rest of my life.
[42:17] **Grayman**: How about you just go ahead and give me the silver so that I can go and
[42:21] **Grayman**: and buy something else with it for somebody that does not yet believe in these silver sense.
[42:27] **Grayman**: And so that distributed issuance and redemption is what makes it such that you don't need credit unions, coin shops, or anything quite that centralized.
[42:39] **Grayman**: It's still centralized, but I mean, it's not totally distributed to the leaves of the tree.
[42:46] **Grayman**: I mean, the customers get to use this stuff and maintain anonymity,
[42:51] **Grayman**: But the vendors themselves are the ones who are kind of centralizing their notes and promising to redeem their notes and putting a time frame and a physical location where they would do that on chain.
[43:06] **Grayman**: So, exposing themselves to the world in the sense that that information is going to be out there.

[43:12] **Byron**: You know, philosophically, I agree with you, Grayman, but I don't think they're in opposition to each other.
[43:17] **Byron**: So they can coexist different use cases, different assumptions and fees for what you do.
[43:26] **Byron**: So that philosophically, I'm on board what you're saying, but they can coexist with each other.
[43:32] **Byron**: And but I agree with you saying.

[43:37] **TMas**: But I kind of think of the coin shops almost like a local chime ATM service.
[43:43] **TMas**: Like if I want to go sell silver as of right now, there's literally no way for me to do it on the blockchain peer to peer until Chain Cash comes out.
[43:52] **TMas**: And even then it's just algorithmically pegged.
[43:55] **TMas**: Like it's not like the actual asset of silver or the commodity of silver.
[43:59] **TMas**: So in a way, I feel like you have to have like,
[44:04] **TMas**: a minute physical distribution hub they could I get exactly what you're saying instead of them actually being like the primary vendor they just use the service in order to distribute it but I do like with Byron like what he's saying I think that there should be a way to at least like partially incentivize somebody to be a vendor for it all by not giving them too much power over
[44:32] **TMas**: The network in any regard basically just simply like i was saying earlier like a small like point zero five percent fee of like whatever transaction costs they handle.
[44:43] **TMas**: On the network and like a gross value basically.

[44:49] **Byron**: Well, they're collateralized.
[44:51] **Byron**: So their commodities that they want on chain would be collateralized.
[44:57] **Byron**: So if someone wanted to purchase that collateralized form, they would redeem it there.
[45:02] **Byron**: These are just public vendors, just like a store that you know you're able to do this action at.
[45:08] **Byron**: The whole point, what Grayman is talking about, the everyday person is going to do what Grayman's talking about, these small amounts, but in the case that Grayman accumulated over 40 years and wanted to do something for a large amount coming out of training, he would probably go that route.
[45:24] **Byron**: So they can coexist.
[45:26] **Byron**: They're not in opposition to each other.
[45:29] **Byron**: They're just use case defendant.

[45:32] **Grayman**: Like right now, you could get $100
[45:35] **Grayman**: Face value for you know 3300 bucks from one of these coin shops.
[45:42] **Grayman**: So yes, they're going to be the ones that are going to distribute a significant amount of actual physical silver.
[45:48] **Grayman**: They're already the concentration points for this stuff.
[45:51] **Grayman**: So when I say that it's a pre existing well distributed tokenized.
[45:55] **Grayman**: Uncensorable currency.
[45:57] **Grayman**: It's pre distributed, but let's face it, there are whales and there's, you know,
[46:02] **Grayman**: There's a lot of it out in people's sock drawers, but people don't really think about this shit right now.
[46:07] **Grayman**: If it changed and became something that was used on a regular basis by people, that would be because it became either a necessity, which it might, if there were like an extended power outage and internet outage, then you might be trading dimes and quarters.
[46:24] **Grayman**: But also it might just be because it becomes more convenient.
[46:27] **Grayman**: And that's the point of Silver Sense is that it just becomes an app on their phone that looks like a frequent customer card or whatever from their perspective.
[46:36] **Grayman**: And so they're just carrying that around, but it's keeping track of, and they can use it at other vendors, but it's keeping track of value.
[46:43] **Grayman**: And so the guys that are the vendors for this, they might need to go and talk to SD Bullion or to their local coin shop
[46:53] **Grayman**: about getting enough so that they have it on hand to redeem.
[46:57] **Grayman**: But again, the amounts of money can't be that large.
[46:59] **Grayman**: That $3,000 sack of $100 face value is not something you're just going to carry around in your pocket.
[47:05] **Grayman**: And that's only $3,000.
[47:07] **Grayman**: Silver is just not that dense of value.
[47:10] **Grayman**: And so it protects you from getting involved in the types of trading that attract criminals and problems.
[47:19] **Grayman**: It becomes a waste.
[47:20] **Grayman**: Silver has long been
[47:22] **Grayman**: the coin of gentlemen, the coin of people just trying to get about their daily day.
[47:28] **Grayman**: Gold is for kings, silver is for gentlemen.

[47:34] **TMas**: On the whole note of like the silver sense thing too, I was also thinking, this is kind of like where I get my idea from for like my outlook on it.
[47:46] **TMas**: So for instance, I do a lot of scrapping like with scrap metal and like gold recovery and such.
[47:51] **TMas**: Basically, there is, unless I sell my boards directly to a board sort, board sort, they'll actually give you sometimes $100 a pound for raw gold fingers.
[48:05] **TMas**: But there's really no way to transact that value into cash unless I give it to the vendor to be able to sell it.
[48:15] **TMas**: Like realistically, nobody's really going to go looking on chain on Ergo right now just for like a single like, okay, oh, I could buy scrap metal here.
[48:25] **TMas**: Oh, I could go buy silver bullion.
[48:28] **TMas**: or whatever.
[48:29] **TMas**: And also too, there needs to be a way to like, if I'm buying, part of the reason why scrapping is so attractive is because like if I have the gold or if I have the copper just sitting there, that's basically as good as just like $500 in cash.
[48:45] **TMas**: If I have $500 of copper, all I have to do is just take it to the scrap yard and they'll just give me the cash right there on hand.
[48:54] **TMas**: But like what if I want SigmaUSD for it or something instead like what if I want Ergo SigmaUSD or I want Ergo tokens, you know, that's where I feel like the thing like silver sense and like that whole kind of like Chain Cash idea would be really useful there for vendors because then it gives them an easier way to
[49:17] **TMas**: like basically move value around without having to use like a traditional banking system and it's all tied into RWAs.
[49:26] **TMas**: Like I was saying earlier, you know, you could even expand upon it even more.
[49:30] **TMas**: Like I'm pretty sure basis is doing this or at least into the future.
[49:34] **TMas**: It's probably going to be the plan to like be able to tokenize.
[49:38] **TMas**: Like if I want to, reverse mortgage my house to Grayman, for example, I can sign the deed, put it up onto.
[49:47] **TMas**: Like a DAO.
[49:48] **TMas**: Right.
[49:49] **TMas**: Then the DAO overview is like, okay, yada, yada, he's got the title.
[49:53] **TMas**: Here's bill of sale.
[49:55] **TMas**: Here's everything.
[49:56] **TMas**: And then it goes into a trust on, like a legal trust.
[50:00] **TMas**: This is why I say like certain things need to kind of be done off chain or else there's no like legal backing for it.
[50:07] **TMas**: Cause who's to say I actually have to pay gray, gray man, my house, if I default on like the $250,000 of loan that he gave me.
[50
