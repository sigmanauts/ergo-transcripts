# Ergo Community AMA Summary - September 25th, 2025

## Executive Summary

This community call focused heavily on Ergo's ongoing dispute with HTX exchange, which demanded $100,000 to prevent delisting in what the community characterized as an extortion scheme. The team published evidence of these demands and created a GitHub repository for the broader crypto community to share similar experiences with predatory exchange practices. On the development front, significant progress was reported across multiple projects including sub-blocks DevNet testing, ChainCash protocol development, Rosen Bridge rune integration, and various DeFi applications.

The discussion also covered strategic alternatives to traditional exchange listings, with kushti proposing liquidity provision on decentralized exchanges like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain to gain automated exposure on major centralized exchanges like BitGet and Coinbase. The team emphasized pivoting away from typical crypto marketing toward positioning Ergo as a platform for building digital economies for human communities and AI agents.

## Notable Quotes

**kushti on HTX's practices**: "I still think it's not extortion, like push for bribery, right? It's not about liquidity or volume, so based on who's got the list, it's Ergo, Komodo and Firo. Firo was totally fine and yeah so it's not about liquidity or volume so it's something different."

**Grayman on Ergo's economic potential**: "you could actually contemplate making currency systems for nations based on Ergo. That's why it fascinates me, but there's very few people that are in that academic community that are just going to immediately leap to that because it's so far outside of their realm of thinking."

**kushti on positioning strategy**: "So yeah, well, there is need to promote Ergo differently, right? So not as crypto, or whatever it's called these days, crypto...but yes, platform, foundation, global, neutral, settlement layer for building digital economies, rights for humans, human communities, developing communities, as well as AI agents."
