[00:12] **qx()**: Happy Ergoversary everybody.

[00:15] **qx()**: I'm QX and with me we have Dan, the man from ZenGate, Dan Friedman.

[00:21] **qx()**: You might recognize him from Dan. I love the hat. Where'd you get that hat from?

[00:26] **Dan Friedman**: This one weirdo gave it to me at some event or something like that. I don't know. You know, it's just, well, what does it say anyway? What is that?

[00:35] **qx()**: Make mining great again.

[00:37] **Dan Friedman**: Oh, okay. It's MGA.

[00:42] **qx()**: All right, Dan, let's, you know, as somebody who's in the ecosystem as myself, sometimes I find that I miss out on things or I'm not completely clear on things. So I think this is a great opportunity to talk to you about what the hell ZenGate is, what the heck Palmyra is, how Ergo helps those kinds of things be possible. Let's start at the top. What's ZenGate, Dan?

[01:07] **Dan Friedman**: Well, ZenGate is actually right behind me. We're in the ZenGate office right now. In Japan. Yeah, in Japan. So this is ZenGate Japan behind me. We have a couple other ZenGate offices, but this is the main one.

[01:22] **Dan Friedman**: I mean, just, you know, long story short, we're a technology company utilizing various different technologies like Web2 and Web3 to fulfill one of our core missions, one of them being opportunity inclusion for MSMEs, micro, small and mid-sized enterprises, which are businesses that mostly produce commodities, although we're not limited to commodities, but they're kind of like the bedrock, they're the lifeblood of the world.

[02:01] **Dan Friedman**: And so I thought that I was going to build a company, was going to work with that sector because that's where the most impact is. And again, another big first principle of ours is real world impact, RWI, which is again, what our technology is here to provide.

[02:23] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, and so that's translated in a series of products, which we call the Palmyra ecosystem and the Web3 part of that, which is the Palm Economy. And essentially, it's a platform that again creates opportunity inclusion for MSMEs. We largely deal with commodity and commodity producers in developing economies.

[02:51] **Dan Friedman**: And we do everything from giving them more market access through the Palmyra platform, Palmyra that app, which is basically a commodities trading and purchasing platform that utilizes Web2 and Web3 for traceability, for authentication, for logistics, to essentially bring, to cut all the waste, cut all the gray area, cut all the black box-ness out of the process and essentially just connect the producer with the buyer, with the consumer and to make both happy, to make sure that the producer gets the most optimal value for their commodity and so that the buyer gets the most optimal value for the money they spend and get what they pay for what they're buying.

[03:56] **qx()**: What's blockchain have to do this? Why? Why blockchain? And you could do this on some sort of proprietary system.

[04:02] **Dan Friedman**: So basically, I mean, one of the core components of this is traceability. And we all know the traceability is something that blockchain is really, really well positioned for - immutable traceability. One of the main issues with commodity trade is the lack of transparency and the lack of traceability and essentially adulteration and counterfeiting.

[04:30] **Dan Friedman**: This happens across the commodity sector everywhere you go. And I'm not just talking about commodities that are traded on commodities exchanges like the golds and the silvers of the world. But say, for example, a commodity like honey. This is one of our pilots right now is with a Zambian honey firm called Nature's Nectar.

[04:56] **Dan Friedman**: And so what we did was we put several thousand producers on chain for traceability and authentication purposes for the honey because statistically honey is one of the most adulterated foodstuffs in the world. It's literally one of the most adulterated foodstuffs because of the lack of transparency between what happens from the producer, the bee hive keeper and the producer that is say in Zambia, to when it hits the shelf at your local wherever you go shopping over there in upstate New York.

[05:41] **qx()**: So when you say that you mean that the honey farmer is going to get a tiny bit of the pie when it's on the shelf, it's going to be 10, 20, 30 times more than that guy sold it to them for.

[05:53] **Dan Friedman**: Well, it's not just that. It's not just that it's going to be 10, 20, 30 times more expensive than what they actually sold it for. It's also not going to be the same product in many cases. It is going to be mixed in with syrups, with other substances. In fact, there was a study that I bring up quite often that was done a few years back that says that potentially almost 80% of all honey in the West is not real honey. It is honey flavored syrup or it might have a percentage of honey in it, but it's actually not real honey. It's not 100% pure honey.

[06:34] **Dan Friedman**: And so this is why it is so important to have traceability, because in the end, the producer wants to give you honey. They want you to buy their honey. But what happens between when the producer sells and when you get is what needs to be, that's where the transparency comes in, and that's where transparency is lacking.

[06:57] **Dan Friedman**: Basically blockchain, one of the things that blockchain does is it helps create that transparency. And so what we have is called a Winter Protocol, which was built on Ergo and it's a full traceability and tokenization protocol. And so this protocol is being used to track and trace in this case, and it has many different uses, but in this case it's used to track and trace the honey literally from the beehive because the actual beehive is on chain to when it actually ends up with you and in fact this honey is going to be available through another one of our portals called Palmyra Express really soon and we're going to have it at Rare Evo which is coming up in less than two months, I think.

[07:46] **qx()**: Is that a site that any normal consumer could go to and just buy like a marketplace?

[07:52] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. So up until now, all of our products have been and all of our commodities have been B2B. A lot of our business has been B2B oriented. There were minimum quantities that you could purchase for various reasons, because a lot of these guys are not retail stores. They're bulk producers. So, you know, you can't ask them to send you, like a half a kilo of tea. You can ask them to send you 100 kilos of tea, 50 kilos, but not a half a kilo.

[08:27] **Dan Friedman**: However, we got so much, so many requests from our community members saying that, hey, guys, I just want to try this stuff. Can I just buy this stuff? And so what we actually did was we created an internal infrastructure where we ourselves purchase from these producers and then create limited quantity offerings to the community through Palmyra Express and that's expressed with an X.

[08:56] **Dan Friedman**: And so you can get there several places. I don't even know which domain name we're going to put out there, but I registered all the different variations of it. So you can go to palmyra.express. To get to it, you can go to palmyra.express with an X because the actual branding is with X, but then, you know, some people might get that wrong and want to just have an express. You can also go to palmyraexpress.com, just palmyraexpress, then palmyraexpress.com. All roads lead to Palmyra. That's basically what it is.

[09:37] **qx()**: How does this work from a logistic standpoint? Do you have like locations in the United States or that kind of continents there? Yeah, somewhere in Europe and you store them there and then ship from there. You're not like shipping right from the producer immediately one off to somebody in the US or one off to somebody in Europe.

[09:57] **Dan Friedman**: It depends on the actual commodity. Sometimes it's going to be directly from the producer, sometimes it's going to be from us because we're going to set up a fulfillment operation as well. Now for these particular offerings that we have, what we're going to be doing is we're actually going to be purchasing from our producers through our U.S. company and then we'll be able to resell this directly to the community that is in the U.S. and Canada.

[10:34] **Dan Friedman**: And so these orders are going to be fulfilled through the ZenGate U.S. entity. And so like I said, sometimes it's directly from the producer, sometimes it's through us because it takes a really long time to get it from the producer because of various different reasons. Like say the producer might be in a developing economy that just does not have expedient logistics. And so, of course, you know, while, you know, if you want to get this stuff directly from the producer, you take it into account. You don't want to have somebody who's buying, you know, a jar of honey wait to have to wait a month to get it.

[11:17] **qx()**: So, I mean, honey is good forever, though, you know, in fairness.

[11:22] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, actually, yes. That's actually something that many people don't know. Honey does not have an expiration date. It is it does not expire unless there is, you know, other outside things that are introduced into it that can go bad. But pure honey itself does not expire.

[11:39] **qx()**: So I remember as a kid, we had we had a beehive in my house when I was a kid and we used to grab the old honey off the shelf that was all crystallized. And my mom would just put it in a little double boiler for like 20, 30 minutes and it'd be normal honey again.

[11:53] **Dan Friedman**: It's all the same. it's sort of the same with maple syrup as well you know maple syrup or literally do put expiration dates on it it literally just turns to you know turns to the crystal turns to sugar right yeah and sugar doesn't have an expiration date and so yeah to bring it back to life like i had this you know, big, giant thing of Canadian maple syrup, I probably had for the past, like, eight years, you know, and it's still like half full, because I don't really use that much corn syrup or maple syrup. But once in a while, I'll have some pancakes.

[12:27] **qx()**: And I'm like, shit, man, I gotta get once in a while, you'll have some pancakes, Dan, let's be honest here.

[12:33] **Dan Friedman**: Well, when I'm in the U.S., okay, but I'm saying I'm not in the U.S., yeah, of course. When I'm in the U.S., the pancakes are a regular thing, but that's because I compensate. I try to increase the pancake intake, and then some people. Some people, although I invite them to IHOP, I invite them to my pancake breakfast, give me shit about, oh, it's so far away, oh, wait a second.

[13:03] **qx()**: I only missed it once, Dan. I've been every other time, just once.

[13:06] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, you missed it once, and that's one time too many QX.

[13:09] **qx()**: All right, so tell me, give me, give me, I've never heard a specific rundown exactly just from what I've read and in my head of actual traceability of how it works. Can you take us through a journey of a baby tea leaf in Sri Lanka and when it gets, when it gets registered on chain, what steps along the way it also gets registered on chain when the initial registration happens, all that kind of goodness. Give us, give us that. Let's name the little tiny tea leaf Earl, we'll call them Earl as an Earl Grey.

[13:42] **Dan Friedman**: It's a he what if he doesn't identify as they them, they they they. Thank you. Thank you. Come on. Come on. 21st century got to be inclusive.

[13:55] **Dan Friedman**: Okay, so again, it's not. Well, again, I don't know if I said it this time, but traceability is not like a one size fits all solution. So in different cases, you can have different levels and granularity of traceability. And in the end, you get down to like, is it really necessary? I mean, how deep do you wanna go? Because you can go really deep with traceability, but in the end it's like, okay, yeah, but if you go this deep, I mean, really, what is the value here? What are the chances if you go this deep that this particular part is actually adulterated or screws up? And sometimes you're like, okay, yeah, there's a, you know, it's like a 2% chance something's going to go bad if you don't have traceability at this point. But you think about it, well, 98 out of 100 is still pretty, pretty damn good. So you have that, you know, you have that threshold that you come up with.

[14:55] **Dan Friedman**: Now, if you are at they, a tea leaf that is being traced, again, it could start all the way from the orchard. And so the way they do it is they utilize a protocol through what we call Palmyra Pro. And so the Palmyra Pro is part of the Palmyra suite that utilizes traceability and really is tailored for, it's producer focused.

[15:23] **Dan Friedman**: So a lot of data gathering and a lot of data processing happens when it's still in production, right? So for example, with tea, it's not just like a robotic process, right? Sometimes it is, but really with the finer teas, what you have is a special formula for when it is picked, which tea leaves are used for which types of teas, which grades of teas, how the tea is dehydrated, how the tea is cured, how the tea is stored, how the tea is packaged and processed.

[16:04] **Dan Friedman**: All of these things can create a unique taste and a unique variant of the tea. And so one of the main things that, for example, happens with tea is producers often have to record the process of how the tea was cured. And then when the tea comes out, they taste it and they see, okay, so this batch came out really well. What was the process? What was the humidity? What was the hydration time? What kind of process we used for dehydration? Which kind of crop was it? Where was the crop from? Like all these different things, they take into account because all these different things have an effect on what it tastes like.

[16:50] **Dan Friedman**: And so what you want to have, especially in premium blends and brands, you want to have that premium consistency. And so that is like, for example, for tea, that is important. That's why traceability is important for that. And so what they do is a lot of times they'll just start right from the orchard. There is, there are places like say Sri Lanka that have year round tea harvesting, you know, just it happens in batches. And that's how they set up these tea orchards.

[17:20] **Dan Friedman**: And so you can start with actually registering all the different tea orchards, site A1, site A2, site A3, in whatever batches you have, however your tea bush is organized. And then you can put in things like, say, for example, pH and weather patterns that were present when the tea was growing. Then you put in information, again, using Palmyra Pro, when the tea was picked and how it was picked. Was it machine picked? Was it hand picked? Which part of the tea leaf was picked? at what time in the day, at what elevation.

[18:13] **Dan Friedman**: And again, elevation, they have low, mid, and high elevation teas, again, that create different types of crops. And all of this is gathered through Palmyra Pro. All this data is gathered through Palmyra Pro. So what does that do? Number one, and again, it goes all the way to when the tea is packaged and shipped off. And it can go beyond that. You can put in logistics information. You can put in a warehouse storage information, say if you want to.

[18:44] **Dan Friedman**: For example, you can use IoT devices. And again, a lot of this uses IoT devices for obvious reasons. You can check the humidity level of the warehouse that it was being stored in. You can put that on chain. You can then also do shelf life. Tea has, I believe, something like a two-year shelf life. So you have to also go and put that on chain if you want to.

[19:16] **Dan Friedman**: And so all this information goes on chain. And again, you decide how granular you want. You might not want to put all of it on chain. You might want to put some of it on chain. Again, it's up to the producer utilizing Palmyra Pro to gather the information, to process the information, to catalog the information and then to present the information to the producer themselves for various reasons, for internal stock keeping, for recording and processing of different crops and what comes out.

[19:53] **Dan Friedman**: Regulations and compliance, for example, they have to go to say the Sri Lankan tea board and they have to bring records of how the tea was grown to get a certification of some sort to exports, you know, getting export certificates and where they have to fulfill different various different in some situations, like, for example, exporting to the EU and the US, they have to fill various different regulation requirements, right, reporting requirements.

[20:25] **Dan Friedman**: One of them is called EUDR. It's the European Union Deforestation Regulation. And it goes into effect, I believe, next year. And so while tea is not a commodity, it's on that list, there is a list of essential commodities that are on that list. Anyway, there's about, I think, yeah, but almost a dozen commodities.

[20:52] **Dan Friedman**: And so these commodities starting next year, they're going to be required to have mandatory traceability information to be able to sell in the EU. And if they don't have this information, they cannot sell in the EU. And in fact, if they don't have this information and they bring products into the EU and try to sell them, they could actually be permanently banished from being able to sell in the EU.

[21:21] **Dan Friedman**: And so this is really scary for people who like, they're gonna like, okay, so how do we do this? Because there is no, you know, the EU didn't say, okay, yeah, so just use this system right here and you're gonna be able to comply through it. It's like, no, you have to have traceability information. It's like, okay, how do we do that? You figure that out. That's basically what they did. And so that's also Palmyra, Palmyra Pro, that's what it does. And again, under the hood, all this is run on the Winter Protocol, which is on Ergo.

[21:52] **qx()**: So Dan, so I have a friend in the paper business. And one of the big things that this big, he works for connecting paper suppliers, paper mills to the actual people who, you know, cut and package the paper after that, they'll sell the huge, huge like, you know, six foot tall, massive rolls in the truck to the company who will then slice them up into paper sheets or whatever, depending on what they want kind of thing.

[22:19] **qx()**: And the thing that his company does is they have their own traceability protocol that's proprietary, right? And the advantage of that is all these companies that they're with and these mills are with, all their data is stored in that proprietary system. If they want to find somebody else to do their stuff, it's probably going to be a headache, right? It's probably going to be a probably going to rethink that kind of thing.

[22:41] **qx()**: So do you feel that the trade-offs of using a blockchain where everything's open, where another company could come in and maybe offer more of a service, maybe offer some different things and just say, oh yeah, your database about all your traceability is public right now. We can just copy exactly what's going on there. And that's what we do. And you'll just continue to add to your traceability history right on that same chain that you were doing it before. And you're not going to notice a difference kind of thing.

[23:08] **qx()**: So do you feel the trade-offs of using the blockchain where something like Ergo where what we've had like zero downtime since launch kind of thing and the cheapness of creating the traceability on chain outweighs those benefits of trying to keep something close to us and trap that customer in essentially?

[23:29] **Dan Friedman**: Well, the thing about that is I mean, aside from just information being on chain, it's all about how it gets there, right? And so there's a term that is used, it's called minimum viable ecosystem, MVE. And so for you to be able to actually create an optimal or an efficient way of reporting, you have to have that minimal viable ecosystem for this to happen. And that happens when people are trained. That happens when people are onboarded onto something like Palmyra Pro. That happens when there are processes in place that utilize Palmyra Pro. And so you can't just switch it out for something else just because the information is on chain. It's how it gets on chain is also important.

[24:24] **Dan Friedman**: And so, yeah, of course, I mean, there could always, I mean, there's always going to be competition out there. But it's not just about the pure information that's on chain. It's about how that information is gathered. It's about how the minimal viable ecosystem is deployed. It's about the onboarding. It's about the integration into it. A lot of companies will not just go, oh, that's just cheaper and let's just do that. They will look at all of this. Okay, yeah, it might be cheaper, say, per month to utilize this, but what is it going to cost us to actually switch over to this? Or what is that company, for example, what are they going to do to grow with us? Because you also have to be able to grow with these businesses and understand what they need.

[25:20] **Dan Friedman**: For example, when we integrate and when we deploy Palmyra Pro with our producers. We work with the producers. It's not just like one of those things like, you know, you sign up and tomorrow you're using it.

[25:35] **qx()**: Right. Right.

[25:36] **Dan Friedman**: I mean, you could create that type of version and eventually we will have something more just a bare bones type of thing where you just kind of DIY the whole thing. But to really have that really big value add that comes from on chain traceability, you have to work with the producer, you have to understand the particular use case. And you have to understand all the nuances. And so that's actually where a lot of the work is.

[26:04] **qx()**: Yeah, it sounds like we have this discussion, I think a couple of weeks ago on the AMA about, you know, with open source software, it's not necessarily the tech part of the project that you're selling to the customer, you're selling your service and something better than somebody else can provide at the time kind of thing.

[26:21] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, essentially it's, it's that, you know, it's not just about the pure functionality. It's about the experience that is around the UX, that's, that's surrounded. And a lot of times, the UX just cannot be copy pasted. You know, it's, it's, you can't, you can copy and paste an ecosystem. Yeah. That has to be built. That has to be organic or else it's not going to work.

[26:49] **qx()**: Yeah. So besides the cheapest, I remember, I remember affordability. I remember MGPi speaking about when he was working on something where he was doing something for Ethereum and then for Cardano and then for Ergo. And he said something that I always remember. He said something like, yep, in Ergo, I did it in a week in Cardano. It took like four weeks. And on Ethereum, it took, you know, like a month or two months kind of thing. And just speaks to the like, turn around the amount of quick time you can really get these kind of things set up and going on Ergo.

[27:27] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. And again, this is one of the main reasons why I started building this thing on Ergo is because it was just all really straightforward. You know, you just go there, you figure out. I mean, it's it's...

[27:36] **qx()**: You even started it. I remember you starting to yourself that I remember you sitting down. Yeah, I did. I did. You were punching it out there for a couple of weeks getting at the base started there.

[27:46] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, I did. I did. I started it because because it's been some years when I, you know, since I actually set down to code and I found out that some of the development environments I was using are no longer used. And so I had to kind of like, you know, I do a refresher and I'm like, why the hell isn't this working? Like Alex is, oh yeah, they don't really use that development environment. Okay, well, I guess, you know, 2015 called.

[28:16] **Dan Friedman**: But, you know, eventually, I mean, and again, with the help of the community and who I ended up actually hiring later on, like for example, Luca was really helpful, you know, from the start, explaining just how to utilize all the different tools on Ergo. And so eventually I just said, Hey, why don't we just have Luca work with us? And so that's how that happened. You know, and, you know, the same thing happened. We should share same thing happened with, with several people that are, that are working at ZenGate. These people came from the community, you know, and that's because these people were, were so helpful in the beginning that I thought that, yeah, I just want to keep working with them.

[28:56] **qx()**: Yeah. Well, that's awesome, Dan. So I think ZenGate and other things in Ergo are really doing what is going to make or break blockchains, right? You know, I feel like blockchain at this point in time, cryptocurrency is on the teeter of have VCs pumped and pulled and sucked enough value out of these chains to where we're finally hitting a point where people, as kushti's preaching, people are sick of these VC dumps, and they're looking for something that actually provides value and that can bring something to, like you say, you say RWIs, right? You say real, what was your term?

[29:35] **Dan Friedman**: Real world impact, that's right.

[29:36] **qx()**: Yeah, you got it. They have real world, but I really feel like ZenGate accomplishes that.

[29:42] **Dan Friedman**: You know, I mean, a lot of this stuff is noise. A lot of this stuff is noise. You really get into it and you just realize that there's so much noise out there in the crypto space that you really have to understand what really matters. And what really matters in the end is when you build things like this, that's why we're in this. That's why we're building this is because that's what makes sense. That's what makes sense in the long term.

[30:16] **Dan Friedman**: And really those of us that got into this movement because we saw the big picture. Sometimes we'll get distracted, you know, and we'll think, oh, you know, it's over, it's over because of all this, you know, useless bullshit that's out there. And then again, you get back to it's like, well, no, but the core mission, the core technology is still there. It's waiting to be used just because it's being used in an idiotic way doesn't mean that it invalidates its core mission, purpose, and possibilities.

[30:53] **qx()**: I agree, Dan. Well, anything you want to say to Ergo or to ZenGate or to the community before we close up here?

[31:00] **Dan Friedman**: Well, look, I'd like to wish everybody a happy Ergoversary. Six years old, I think, right?

[31:07] **qx()**: 2019? Something like that. Six years old, yeah.

[31:11] **Dan Friedman**: Six years old. I'm going to be ready for first grade soon. It's been an honor and a privilege to be part of the community, to be able to build a business on Ergo, to be able to build on Ergo. I mean, I just hope more people out there in the community take that extra step and really start building a business because I think that's really what this needs.

[31:40] **Dan Friedman**: I always say that Ergo is the US Steel of blockchains. You might not know it by name, but a bunch of stuff that you use is built with it. So I think that that's a damn fine place to be in. I think that's essentially that puts it as one of the core building blocks of the entire blockchain movement. And like I said, I still strongly believe that and I hope that others will join me and they believe it so much that they will spend their time, their money and their energy in building a business on Ergo.

[32:22] **qx()**: Amazing well said Dan can't top that. Thanks so much for joining us and happy birthday Ergo Thank you very much.

[32:29] **Dan Friedman**: Yep. Happy birthday Ergo.
