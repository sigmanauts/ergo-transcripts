      "question": "What are the benefits for miners when other chains merge mine with Ergo?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "Merge mining provides additional security budget for both chains - miners receive extra rewards beyond just ERG, including storage rent and merge mined rewards (a 'triple' benefit). This is similar to how Bitcoin miners get additional rewards from sidechains like Rootstock and Namecoin, and how Dogecoin provides the biggest security budget for Litecoin through merge mining.",

      "asker": "Grayman",
      "answer": "Merge mined sidechains help the base chain with security budget issues by providing miners additional rewards. For example, Dogecoin (merge mined with Litecoin) is now the biggest provider of Litecoin's security budget, and scrypt ASIC advertisements now promote Dogecoin mining first. This helps prevent attacks and grows hash rate, which would similarly benefit Bitcoin long-term.",

      "asker": "Ella",
      "answer": "Quantum-proof cryptographic protocols are still too exotic and there's no immediate rush since quantum computers aren't an active threat yet. The best approach would be to fork to quantum-proof protocols once they're mature and quantum computing becomes a real threat. Ergo is less at risk than Bitcoin because it doesn't use the weaker cryptography found in old Bitcoin wallets.",

Users send messages to smart contracts on their respective chains, and a front-end compiles and parses these messages, allowing cross-chain communication. Users can showcase products and potentially use VoltPay to swap between ecosystems, creating opportunities for global economic interaction.",
