## Notable Quotes

**kushti on open source development**: "So that was the path of MewFinance, I believe. Right, and that's actually quite exciting to me so that's the power of open source right so not just open source but free software right so you can take it you can modify you can run modified version freely right"

**Armeanio on DeFi protocols**: "I think that sometimes when you're looking like DeFi, you just need to be cold and look at the parameters of a system. This is how it functions and operate from that perspective rather than like an emotional level. Because, yeah, crying is not the type of liquidity we need, folks."

**kushti on Ergo's potential**: "I think still the Ergo potential is uncovered by like 1% maybe... so there is time to open new horizons, right, for the different developments possible"
