# Ergo Community Call Summary - September 11th, 2025

## Executive Summary

The second weekly Community Ergo AMA featured robust discussions on development progress, community growth strategies, and accessibility challenges. Key participants included kushti (core developer), qx() (community infrastructure lead), and several community members including Dmitriy (MindHealer developer), Ben, and Grayman. The call covered significant technical updates including Node 6.0 improvements, sub-blocks development, and the GitCircles project for community currencies.

Major themes centered around making Ergo more accessible to mainstream users, with Ben highlighting the complexity barriers facing potential adopters, and Dmitriy proposing outreach to non-crypto communities. The group discussed governance models, comparing Ergo's community-driven approach to VC-funded projects and Bitcoin's development challenges.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Technical Development Updates**: Node 6.0 changes reviewed, sub-blocks testing ongoing with extreme 30-second devnet and 60 sub-blocks per block
• **GitCircles Project**: Community currency system for developer communities, targeting airdrops to existing developer groups outside crypto
• **Accessibility Challenges**: Ben raised concerns about the complexity of acquiring and using Ergo, proposing fiat payment integration for raffles and donations
• **Community Growth Strategy**: Discussion of targeting travel bloggers and non-crypto communities rather than existing crypto influencers
• **Infrastructure Updates**: P2P infrastructure expansion planned, ergoplatform.org migration to community hosting to reduce costs
• **Security Features**: Nautilus wallet implementing spam token filtering and scammer address warnings based on community lists
• **Upcoming Events**: Colorado meetup announced for October 11th with live streaming planned

## Decisions Made

• Integrate GoFundMe/fiat payment option alongside crypto payments for future Ergo raffles as accessibility test
• Continue weekly community AMA format with open participation
• Proceed with ergoplatform.org migration to community infrastructure
• Target developer communities outside crypto for GitCircles project testing

## Notable Quotes

**kushti**: "But the point is that there is no need to spend energy, time and money on those so-called crypto people. The idea is to get ordinary people to trust some decentralized money."

**Ben**: "God is it a pain in the ass to use [crypto]. If I could, I'd go to the local pizza shop and pay with my ERG. That'd be great. But that's so many steps... it's simply put, it's too difficult to be an Ergo user."

**Grayman**: "We need somebody to stand up from that perspective and say, hey, look, this is not about the latest technical nuance so much as it is about making it super easy to get people involved."
