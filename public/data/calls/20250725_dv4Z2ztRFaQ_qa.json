      "question": "How are sub-blocks and sigma chains progressing, and what's the vision for horizontal scaling with proof of work?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "The goal for two years has been taking proof of work energy and scaling horizontally. There's a sustainability concern with traditional models where layer two solutions create value leakage from miners, as transaction volume moves off layer one while mining rewards decrease. We're exploring ways to let miners absorb more transaction value through side chains while maintaining the security umbrella, creating a miner-centric future rather than a dev-centric layer two approach.",

      "question": "Can you hide amounts in liquidity pools to enable completely obfuscated trading?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "It's problematic for public liquidity pools because everyone needs to know amounts to trade efficiently. You can't set limit orders if you can't read other orders, or determine slippage if you don't know pool liquidity. You could do dark pools with limited functionality or pools controlled by trusted parties, but that defeats the purpose of decentralization.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "SigmaLock is a locking mechanism similar to life insurance or inheritance planning. You can lock funds with unlock conditions based on time or price strikes, create multiple unlock keys for beneficiaries, and optionally retain creator permissions to modify contracts later. It's built with a custom Go indexing framework for instant transaction visibility and mempool support for real-time updates.",

      "asker": "Grayman",
      "answer": "The vision is to allow multiple guard sets to use the same infrastructure, creating competitive federations. Different guard sets could form with their own collateral treasuries, offering various levels of backing, settlement speeds, and fees. Users could choose between multiple intermediaries, fostering competition rather than trying to make it fully non-federated.",

      "asker": "Grayman",
      "answer": "Nautilus was designed with a backend that can support multiple environments long-term. To add BTC, you'd need Bitcoin blockchain information and an SDK to integrate Rosen directly into the wallet. This would enable users to manage assets in a unified environment instead of fragmented experiences across different apps.",

      "asker": "Byron",
      "answer": "Ergo is intents-oriented by design since day one. UTXO spending conditions are essentially intents - you specify only conditions that matter and leave the rest to others. Intents and account abstraction are products of account-based blockchains trying to relax their strict contractual descriptions, but these concepts already exist natively in UTXO models.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "It's an order-based DEX where users create their own local smart contracts offering buy/sell limits. A backend matching engine aggregates these individual UTXO contracts across the chain. It's not a traditional order book or AMM - it's peer-to-peer where individuals create local orders that get matched, removing the need for central contracts or bookmakers.",
