# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** June 27, 2025  
**Title:** Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA - June 26th

## Executive Summary

This community call covered several major infrastructure and development updates for the Ergo blockchain ecosystem. The most significant announcement was QX's plan to decentralize the official Ergo explorer infrastructure by transitioning from EF-funded hosted servers to a network of community-operated nodes distributed globally. This initiative aims to reduce the Ergo Foundation's financial burden while maintaining reliability through geographic distribution and volunteer participation.

The call also discussed upcoming developments including Oracle Pool v2 updates, plans for DexyUSD launch around September, integration possibilities with Midnight (Cardano's privacy chain), and progress on Crystal Pools DEX aggregator. Kushti provided insights into various technical topics including privacy chains, consensus mechanisms, and the practical challenges of implementing privacy features while maintaining network statistics.

## Notable Quotes

**QX on Ergo's Development Tools**: *"The tooling here on Ergo is absolutely fantastic for the most part to be able to dive in at different levels, whether I want to use a full SDK in Scala, or I want to go into something much easier like Python."*

**Kushti on Ergo's Development Philosophy**: *"It wasn't probably... So, even Monero, for example, was different, right? So, well, in this regard, it could be comparable with Bitcoin early days, very early days. Bitcoin of 2009, right, when there were only engineers, there were no marketing folks. Like Ergo before 2020."*

**QX on Decentralization**: *"It's hard to kill the voice of Ergo or the Ergo stream or the Ergo blockchain at all. So super, super cool that we can just keep on cranking this stuff out no matter what."*
