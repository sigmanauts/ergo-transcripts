      "question": "What is the unique feature that Rosen Bridge offers compared to other cross-chain bridges?",
      "asker": "kushti",
      "answer": "Rosen offers the ability to have unilateral access for both the network coin and tokens on top of the network with relatively clear security assumptions. Unlike optimistic bridges that offset computational cost, Rosen moves computational costs to another layer, spreads it out across a set of actors (watchers), and creates incentives for them to run that part of the system.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "Doge has been kicking our ass because the nodes and explorers are pretty tight with crappy infrastructure. The rate limits are super strict, so we had to design a new module for a multi-resource backend. Doge became an engineering challenge requiring special engineering to meet the specifications and expectations of other implementations.",

      "asker": "implied",
      "answer": "We have avoided stable coins because if you have a foundation that can be frozen, seized, etc., you cannot really honestly claim that it's backed one to one. That's subject to change at any time based on the whims of a central actor that you don't control. This is one of the most underappreciated risks that's not really priced in.",

Version 6.0 will hopefully be released next week, maybe closer to the end of the week if no more issues are found. Last week Dusick found some consensus issues between 5.0 and 6.0 nodes, but those have been fixed.",

      "asker": "Mark",
      "answer": "It has to do with data collection and scraping the chain. You have the blockchain, then you have infrastructure wrapped around the chain that's constantly calling it and reading the chain, putting it in a better format. A lot of that infrastructure around Doge itself is pretty strict with tight rate limits, making it hard to extract data.",

      "question": "Can a token like Rosen have a bigger market cap than ERG, and what would that mean for security?",
      "asker": "Ursa Minor",
      "answer": "Relative to what it offers, ERG is very mismatched based on the rest of the crypto market. The mismatch is probably a function of awareness and access struggles. However, long term it doesn't make practical sense for tokens to exceed ERG's value, and they likely go hand in hand in terms of growth.",

      "question": "Does having token market caps exceed ERG's market cap compromise security, and how is this different from proof of stake networks?",
      "asker": "Grayman",
      "answer": "No, it doesn't compromise security. In the long term, a big market cap of tokens means a big amount of storage rent, which actually increases security. Tokens contribute to the security budget of mining through storage rent. With time, a big total market cap of tokens is actually good and adds to security. Ergo is quite unique because of the demurrage components adding a new variable to the mining security budget equation.",
