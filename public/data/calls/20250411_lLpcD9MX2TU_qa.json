      "asker": "Dan Friedman",
      "answer": "MewFinance automates the bridging by reading the metadata on Cardano and dumping it into a register on Ergo to remint the token. They don't burn the original token completely - instead they throw it into a lock contract for safekeeping.",

      "asker": "Dan Friedman",
      "answer": "To maintain utility token classification and avoid security classification, there must be clear utility on every chain. They need staking support on Ergo before they can officially create liquidity pools. Without staking, launching pools could violate regulations and change the token's classification from utility to security.",

The philosophy is non-breaking development so application developers can be confident their builds will stay functional. The ecosystem can be built like a medieval cathedral - solid constructions built over time that last centuries. ErgoScript applications from 2019 still work exactly the same way today.",

You can have wallets controlled by one of 100 policies using a Merkle tree root hash instead of huge scripts. This provides privacy and compact storage for complex wallet scenarios. Finite State Machines allow multi-stage contract execution with state progression, useful for disputes and escrow scenarios.",

      "asker": "Ursa Miner",
      "answer": "Traditional indexes rely on centralized sources with vested interests in price direction. Decentralized oracles have incentive structures focused on providing accurate data rather than manipulating prices. Anyone can spin up oracles without being part of exclusive consortiums. The decentralized consensus makes manipulation much harder since you'd need to convince the majority of oracles to provide false data, similar to attacking any blockchain consensus.",

      "asker": "Dan Friedman",
      "answer": "In oracle pools, outlier data gets excluded and only the calculated average from the majority gets posted on-chain. You'd need to convince the majority of oracles to post invalid data. Bad actors lose their participation tokens and future income from the oracle system, creating strong incentives to be honest. The larger group of naturally good actors in the Ergo ecosystem helps maintain integrity.",
