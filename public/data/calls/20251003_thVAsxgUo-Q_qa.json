      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "There are not many fields to write the data we need for bridging operations. Even if there are possibilities, there's need for wallet support and user adoption. Some protocol possibilities exist but are not covered in wallets, making them not quite usable. It's quite challenging, but we continue to explore different options that are also comfortable for end users.",

      "asker": "Willem Jan Vandenberg",
      "answer": "While Winter Protocol has been ported to Cardano, from a business perspective Ergo offers much better scalability and lower network fees for creating tokens and tracking compared to Cardano. The cost difference makes Ergo more feasible for client operations. However, Palmyra's decisions depend heavily on their real-world partners and external factors like legal jurisdictions.",

One option discussed is to do a DarkFi-based sidechain, but DarkFi is still in development with only early testnets available. It makes sense to wait until DarkFi launches or becomes stabilized before proceeding.",

      "answer": "While you could build logic to read voting decisions from a DAO and change configs automatically, the de facto final change will always be on the node config. Miners can always get around automated systems by tweaking settings manually. However, a DAO could provide an on-chain ledger of voting discussions and create incentives through DAO tokens and staking rewards to encourage participation.",
