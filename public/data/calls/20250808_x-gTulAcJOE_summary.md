# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** August 8, 2025  
**Call Title:** Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA (COMMUNITY EDITION) - August 7th

## Executive Summary

This community-focused AMA covered significant technical progress and ecosystem developments for Ergo blockchain. The most notable technical advancement discussed was the upcoming release of node version 6.1, which will enable testing of sub-blocks functionality on the public testnet. This represents a major step forward in Ergo's scaling capabilities. The call also addressed important infrastructure changes, including the launch of the InfraDAO for decentralized hosting and the winding down of Spectrum Network, though ErgoDEX remains operational.

Several exciting integrations were highlighted, including the successful implementation of a "buy ERG" button in Nautilus wallet connecting to Banxa for fiat on-ramps, and kushti's positive security audit of SigmaLock contracts. The discussion also touched on broader ecosystem opportunities, particularly regarding Rosen bridge expansion to Base blockchain, which could provide new pathways to Coinbase trading.

## Notable Quotes

**kushti on staying focused:** *"Yeah, I mean, it's a bit hard to stay sane in this space at all. But yeah, it's better to just stay in some circle, right, which is not as insane as the whole space."*

**qx() on development approach:** *"I try to think of it like a swimmer, right? When a professional swimmer is swimming, they're not picking their head up every second to look at the wall... I think of it that way globally with the stuff that I keep myself busy with."*

**kushti on developer outreach:** *"I think there is a need to do another marketing campaign for developers like we did back in 2020. This time probably it should be more ideological... There are just very few harbors, right? Rebel developers can unite and develop like Ergo."*
